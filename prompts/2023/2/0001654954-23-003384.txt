Item 1. Business

You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our financial statements as of December 31, 2022, and the notes to such financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Overview

We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing proprietary therapeutics designed to extend life or improve quality of life for cancer patients. We are building a drug development pipeline through the licensing and acquisition of therapeutics in late preclinical and clinical development stages. We leverage our scientific and clinical experience to help reduce the risk and accelerate the clinical development of our drug product candidates.

During 2022, we expanded the number of clinical trial sites in our global Phase 2b/3 clinical trial of our lead product candidate, Validive® (clonidine hydrochloride mucobuccal tablet; clonidine HCI MBT), for the prevention of chemoradiotherapy (“CRT”)-induced severe oral mucositis (“SOM”) in patients with oropharyngeal cancer (“VOICE” trial). We currently have active sites in the U.S., Spain, France, Germany and Poland and have completed enrollment of the Phase 2b portion of the clinical trial with a go/no go interim analysis decision from our independent data monitoring committee anticipated by the end of March 2023. We also continued enrolling in our U.S.-based open-label, Phase 1b clinical trial of camsirubicin for the treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcoma (“ASTS”). We also, in collaboration with our partner, NorthStar Medical Radioisotopes, LLC, continue to move forward with the development of MNPR-101 for radiopharmaceutical use in advanced cancers.  Finally, we continue to develop MNPR-202, an analog of camsirubicin designed to potentially treat doxorubicin- and camsirubicin-resistant cancers, which is being tested in preclinical models by our collaborator, the Cancer Science Institute of Singapore at the National University of Singapore.

To complete the VOICE clinical program, including, if required, completing a second Phase 3 confirmatory clinical trial, we will require additional funding in the millions or tens of millions of dollars (depending on if we have consummated a collaboration or partnership or neither for Validive) which we are planning to pursue within the next 12 months. We also require additional funding to continue to develop camsirubicin through and beyond our ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial and to further fund our current and future product pipeline.

 Our Product Candidates

Validive (clonidine hydrochloride mucobuccal tablet; clonidine HCI MBT)

Validive is designed to be used prophylactically to prevent SOM in patients undergoing CRT for oropharyngeal cancer (“OPC”). SOM is a painful and debilitating inflammation and ulceration of the mucous membranes lining the oral cavity and oropharynx in response to chemoradiation. The majority of patients receiving CRT to treat their OPC develop SOM, which remains one of the most common and devastating side effects of treatment in this indication. The potential clinical benefits to preventing SOM in patients include: reduced treatment discontinuations leading to potentially improved overall survival outcomes; reduced mouth and throat pain avoiding the need for feeding tube intervention; decreased long-term and often permanent debilitation arising from swallowing difficulties, neck and throat spasms, and lung complications due to food aspiration; and decreased reliance on pain medication. Our mucobuccal tablet (“MBT”) formulation is a novel delivery system for clonidine that allows for prolonged and enhanced local delivery of drug in the regions of mucosal radiation damage in patients with OPC. Validive has been granted fast track designation in the U.S., orphan drug designation in the EU, and has global intellectual property patent protection through mid-2029 not accounting for possible patent extensions.

In September 2017, we exercised an option to license Validive from Onxeo S.A., the company that developed Validive through its Phase 2 clinical trial. In the completed Phase 2 clinical trial, Validive demonstrated clinically meaningful efficacy signals within the 64-patient OPC population randomized to placebo, Validive 50 µg dose and Validive 100 µg dose. The absolute incidence of SOM in OPC patients who received a dose of Validive 100 µg once per day was reduced by 26.3% (incidence rate of 65.2% in placebo, 45.0% in Validive 50 µg group, and 38.9% in Validive 100 µg group). The median time to onset of SOM was 37 days in the placebo cohort; 45 days in the Validive 50 µg cohort and no median time of onset was reached in the Validive 100 µg group since fewer than half of this cohort of patients developed SOM. There was also a 37.8% reduction in the median duration of the SOM for the Validive 100 µg group versus placebo (41.0 days placebo group, 34.0 days Validive 50 µg group, and 25.5 days Validive 100 µg group) in patients that developed SOM. Median duration of SOM across all patients, inclusive of both those that did and did not develop SOM, was 17 days in the placebo group and 0 days in each of the Validive 50 and 100 µg groups. A positive dose response was seen in each of these three clinical endpoints. Additionally, patients in the Validive cohorts in the Phase 2 clinical trial demonstrated a safety profile similar to that of placebo. Onxeo’s promising preclinical studies and Phase 2 clinical trial have informed the design and conduct of what we believe will be an effective Phase 2b/3 and, if required, second confirmatory Phase 3 clinical program.

In February 2021, we dosed the first patient in our Phase 2b/3 VOICE trial. In August 2021, we successfully reached our original target of 20 activated clinical trial sites for the Phase 2b portion of the 2b/3 Validive® VOICE trial, and in September 2021 we received authorization to proceed with the VOICE clinical trial in multiple countries in Europe. In 2022, we completed enrollment of the Phase 2b portion of the VOICE trial and commenced enrolling the Phase 3 portion. As of March 10, 2023, we have 81 clinical sites activated and enrolling patients in the U.S. and Europe. To be prepared for a positive go/no-go decision based on the interim analysis, anticipated to occur by the end of March 2023, we continue to activate additional sites globally. To complete the VOICE clinical program, including, if required, completing a second Phase 3 confirmatory clinical trial, we will require additional funding in the millions or tens of millions of dollars (depending on if we have consummated a collaboration or partnership or neither for Validive), which we are planning to pursue within the next 12 months.

SOM typically arises in the immune tissue at the back of the tongue and throat, which comprise the oropharynx, and consists of acute severe tissue damage and pain that prevents patients from swallowing, eating and drinking. Validive stimulates the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor (alpha-2AR) on macrophages (white blood cells present in the immune tissues of the oropharynx) suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Validive exerts its effects locally in the oral cavity and oropharynx over a prolonged period of time through its unique MBT formulation. Patients who develop SOM are also at increased risk of developing late onset toxicities, including trismus (jaw, neck, and throat spasms), dysphagia, and lung complications, which are often irreversible and lead to increased hospitalization and the need for further interventions sometimes years after completion of CRT. We believe that the prevention of SOM by Validive will have the potential to reduce treatment discontinuation and/or treatment delays potentially leading to improved survival outcomes and reducing or eliminating these long-term morbidities resulting from CRT.

The OPC target population for Validive is the most rapidly growing segment of head and neck cancer (“HNC”) patients, with an estimated greater than 40,000 new cases of OPC in the U.S alone in 2023. The growth in OPC is driven by the increasing prevalence of oral human papilloma virus (“HPV”) infections in the U.S. and around the world. Despite the availability of a pediatric/adolescent HPV vaccine, the rate of OPC incidence in adults is not anticipated to be materially reduced for decades due to low adoption of the vaccine to date. As a result, the incidence of HPV-driven OPC is projected to increase for years to come and will continue to represent a clinical need for Validive for the prevention of CRT-induced SOM in patients with OPC since CRT is the standard of care treatment, and we anticipate that radiation will remain an important treatment modality for these patients for years to come.

Validive is an MBT of clonidine. The MBT formulation was developed to enhance drug delivery to the oral mucosa while minimizing systemic absorption. The Validive tablet is tasteless and odorless and is self-administered once daily by affixing it to the outside of the patient’s upper gum where it dissolves slowly over a period of several hours, resulting in the extended release of clonidine into the oral cavity and oropharynx, the sites of SOM following CRT for OPC. Validive treatment begins on the first day of CRT and continue daily through the last day of radiation.

The majority of patients receiving CRT to treat their OPC develop SOM, which is one of the most common and devastating side effects of treatment in this indication. We believe Validive has the potential to address several critical elements that affect SOM patients, including:

Reduction in the incidence of SOM. SOM can increase the risk of acute and chronic comorbidities, including dysphagia, trismus and lung complications, which are often irreversible and lead to increased hospitalization and the need for additional interventions. In a Phase 2 clinical trial, the OPC patient cohort treated with Validive 100 µg demonstrated a reduction in the absolute incidence of SOM compared to placebo of 26.3% (incidence rate of 65.2% in placebo, 45.0% in Validive 50 µg group, 38.9% in Validive 100 µg group). A reduced incidence of SOM in OPC patients may lower the risk of acute and chronic comorbidities, and improve clinical outcomes and quality of life.

Delay in the time to onset of SOM. SOM can cause cancer treatment delay and/or discontinuation, which seriously impacts overall survival outcomes. In the Phase 2 clinical trial, OPC patients had a time to onset of SOM of 37 days in the placebo cohort; 45-day time to onset of SOM in the Validive 50 µg cohort; and a median time was not reached in the Validive 100 µg group as fewer than half of the patients developed SOM. Prolonging time to onset of SOM typically leads to fewer missed CRT treatments, resulting in improved overall survival outcomes.


7


Decrease in the duration of SOM. Longer duration of SOM leads to a higher risk of the need for parenteral nutrition and lower quality of life. SOM patients experience difficulty or inability to drink and/or eat, and difficulty in swallowing often results in malnourishment and feeding tube intervention. The Phase 2 clinical trial data demonstrated a 15.5-day reduction (by 37.8%) in the duration of SOM for patients treated with Validive 100 µg (41-day median duration with placebo, 34 days with the Validive 50 µg group, and 25.5 days for the Validive 100 µg group) in patients that developed SOM. Median duration across all patients, inclusive of both those that did and did not develop SOM, was 17 days in the placebo group and 0 days in each of the Validive 50 ug and 100 µg groups. Reduced duration of SOM has the capacity to result in lower risk of malnourishment and feeding tube intervention, and fewer treatment terminations/delays.

While not designed by us, Onxeo’s promising preclinical studies and Phase 2 clinical trial have informed the design and conduct of what we believe will be an effective Phase 2b/3 VOICE clinical trial.

In response to COVID-19 and its effects on clinical trials, in 2020, we adjusted our clinical development plan accordingly to fit what is feasible in the current environment. We simplified the design of the previously planned Phase 3 clinical trial for Validive for the prevention of CRT-induced severe oral mucositis in patients with oropharyngeal cancer (“VOICE”), to a seamless Phase 2b/3 design. This design is based on a binary primary endpoint, incidence of SOM, and minimizes touch points with the clinical trial sites and patients. Validive is a once daily self-administered mucoadhesive tablet which can be taken in the patient’s home setting. The VOICE trial (NCT04648020) is a randomized, placebo-controlled and double blinded global clinical trial with trial sites in the U.S., Spain, France, Germany and Poland. In 2022, we completed enrollment of the Phase 2b portion of the VOICE trial and commenced enrollment in the Phase 3 portion. As of March 10, 2023, we have 81 clinical sites activated and enrolling patients in the U.S. and Europe.

The blinded interim analysis of clinical data from the Phase 2b patient cohort of the trial, to be performed by an independent data monitoring committee, will be used to guide us as to whether or not to continue enrolling the Phase 3 portion of the trial. This analysis should be completed and reported out by the end of March 2023. To be prepared for a positive go/no-go decision based on the interim analysis, we continue to activate additional sites globally. The entire trial has been designed to enroll up to 260 evaluable patients. This modification in design allowed us to activate and commence dosing the VOICE trial in early 2021 without requiring near-term financing. If the interim analysis results in a no-go decision, we would need to reconsider our efforts with respect to Validive and refocus our development efforts on our other product candidates Because the interim analysis is being performed by an independent data monitoring committee, we do not know what the results will be as of the date of this Annual Report.

Assuming a positive result of the go/no go interim analysis decision anticipated by the end of March 2023, to complete the Phase 3 portion of the VOICE clinical program, including, if required, completing a second Phase 3 confirmatory clinical trial, we will require additional funding in the millions or tens of millions of dollars (depending on if we have consummated a collaboration or partnership or neither for Validive), which we are planning to pursue within the next 12 months. Validive has been granted fast track designation in the U.S., orphan drug designation in the EU, and has global intellectual property patent protection through mid-2029 not accounting for possible patent extensions.

Validive U.S. Market Opportunity

The incidence of HNC (all anatomical types, including larynx, oral cavity, oropharynx, etc.) in the U.S. was estimated to be approximately 65,630 cases in 2020 (American Society of Clinical Oncology, cancer.net). The most rapidly growing type of HNC is OPC. The oropharynx is comprised largely of immune tissue and includes the soft palate, the base (rear one third) of the tongue, and the tonsils. In the U.S., the incidence of OPC is estimated to be greater than 40,000 cases in 2023. The majority of these OPC patients (approximately 70%) are human papilloma virus positive (“HPV+”). The incidence of OPC is also increasing in the rest of the world (>30% of HNC), with >50% of all OPC being HPV+. While certain types of HNC have been in decline in the U.S., such as laryngeal cancer as a result of a reduction in the smoking population, the total incidence of HNC has been growing steadily primarily due to OPC. The increase in OPC is directly associated with increased infection with the human papilloma virus. The incidence of HPV+ OPC has outpaced the incidence of HPV– HNC by 4-5-fold over the past decade. This trend of HPV+ OPC driving an increase in overall HNC is expected to continue for some time as the relatively recent introduction of a vaccine designed to prevent the transfer and colonization with HPV is only effective if administered prior to infection, and until October 2018, it was only recommended for those under the age of 26 (newer U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) guidelines include those up to age 45). Even for those under the age of 26 who are eligible for the vaccine, oral HPV infections are predicted to increase due to the lack of adequate use of HPV vaccinations. Approximately 50% of eligible females and 33% of eligible males are presently being vaccinated.

Most OPC is caused by the HPV16 strain, with virus detectable in the tumor. More than 3% of adult men and 1% of adult woman have HPV16 detectable in their saliva at any one time. The virus is transmitted through sexual contact and CDC estimates 10% of men and 3.6% of women in the U.S. have an active oral HPV infection. The latency period for that proportion that do go on to develop HPV+ OPC is 15-20+ years. This HPV+ OPC population is expected to be a long-term driver of the incidence of OPC, and the resultant SOM associated with what is frequently curative therapy for this serious malignancy.

In previous studies describing SOM in OPC patients receiving the CRT regimen we are using in our VOICE clinical program, patients had a SOM incidence rate of 55-90% across studies. In the Validive Phase 2 trial, the incidence of SOM in OPC patients receiving placebo was 65.2% (see “Validive Phase 2 Clinical Trial Data” section below). Currently there is no way to predict which patients will develop SOM, so any active preventive treatment for SOM will likely be used in most OPC patients receiving CRT. With the consistently growing incidence of OPC as a result of the human papillomavirus, there is the potential for a substantial and growing market for Validive.

Validive Mechanism of Action

Validive is designed to deliver high local concentrations of clonidine, an agonist of alpha-2AR, to the oral cavity and oropharynx, the site of irradiation in the treatment of OPC. In the oropharynx, alpha-2AR is expressed on macrophages, immune cells that produce inflammatory cytokines, the molecules that are responsible for the development of SOM, in response to CRT. Several published clinical reports have demonstrated that chemoradiation treatment substantially increased salivary cytokine levels and a recent study demonstrated that these were positively associated with the formation of SOM in patients with head and neck cancer. Patients with HPV+ OPC demonstrate an increased accumulation of macrophages in the tumor microenvironment compared to patients with OPC that were negative for human papilloma virus (“HPV–”), thus further priming HPV+ OPC patients for the development of SOM. The alpha-2AR regulates the expression of cytokines by macrophages, and clonidine reduces this cytokine production. Macrophages are the primary immune cells in the oropharynx that express alpha-2AR, making clonidine’s mechanism of cytokine suppression macrophage selective and distinct from the mechanism of other anti-inflammatory drugs. Further, Validive delivers clonidine to the mucosal surface, the site most affected by chemoradiation treatment in OPC. This results in high salivary concentrations of clonidine, minimizing systemic absorption, and allowing for maximal exposure the at-risk oral mucosa and the OPC microenvironment to drug. Preclinical studies and a Phase 2 clinical trial of Validive have provided data that support Validive’s mechanism of action and therapeutic potential for reducing the incidence of SOM in patients with OPC, improving oral mucositis-related symptoms, and decreasing CRT-related adverse events, while exhibiting a favorable safety profile and high compliance rate in patients.
Validive Phase 2 Clinical Trial Data

In October 2015, the results from an international Phase 2 clinical trial of Validive were announced, demonstrating promising signs of clinical activity and safety compared to placebo. The trial enrolled 183 HNC patients and was conducted in more than thirty centers in Europe and the United States. Patients who had undergone surgical resection of their head and neck cancer with curative intent and who were planned to receive at least 50 Gray (Gy) of radiation in combination with chemotherapy, regardless of anatomical location of disease, were included in this study. This global, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, three-arm study (NCT01385748) compared the efficacy and safety of Validive 50 µg and 100 µg to placebo in patients with HNC receiving CRT. Of the 183 HNC patients, 64 had OPC (placebo = 24, Validive 50 µg = 21, Validive 100 µg = 19). Validive and placebo were administered once daily beginning 1 to 3 days prior to CRT and continuing until the end of chemoradiation.

We believe the Phase 2 clinical trial data support the development of Validive for the prevention of SOM in OPC patients. The analysis of OPC patients in this study showed:


● | The incidence of SOM (primary endpoint) was reduced by 26.3% (40% relative to placebo) in OPC patients treated with Validive 100 µg (p=0.09, a meaningful trend but not statistically significant). 65.2% of OPC patients on placebo experienced SOM compared to only 38.9% of OPC patients on Validive 100 µg.

● | Patients on Validive experienced a delay in the time to onset of SOM. Patients receiving placebo experienced a median time to onset of SOM of 37 days; patients receiving Validive (50 µg one per day) experienced a 45-day median time to onset of SOM; and patients receiving Validive (100 µg once per day) did not reach a median time to onset. A comparison of hazards for time to onset demonstrated that patients that received Validive 100 µg had a hazard ratio (HR)=0.48 compared to placebo.

● | Patients receiving Validive experienced a decrease in the median duration of SOM. In patients that developed SOM, a 15.5-day reduction (by 37.8%) in the median duration of SOM was observed in patients treated with Validive 100 µg (41-day median duration with placebo, 34 days in the Validive 50 µg group, and 25.5 days in the Validive 100 µg group). Median duration across all patients, inclusive of both those that did and did not develop SOM, was 17 days in the placebo group and 0 days in each of the Validive 50 and 100 µg groups.

● | Improvements in other indicators of clinical benefit, including decreased weight loss, decreased opiate use and increased cumulative dose of radiation received, strongly favored the Validive 100 µg treated group. 
● | A dose response was observed with the Validive 100 µg dose, demonstrating a trend toward superiority over the Validive 50 µg dose as well as placebo. Individual patient-level data supports advancing the Validive 100 µg dose into Phase 2b/3.

Individual Patient Data Showing Incidence, Time to Onset, and Duration of SOM in OPC patients
Treated with Placebo and Two Different Doses of Validive (50 and 100 µg/day)



For the full 183-patient Phase 2 population, which included various types of head and neck cancer such as oral and laryngeal cancer in addition to OPC, the incidence of SOM was lower in patients treated with Validive (45.3% when the 50 and 100 µg dose groups were pooled together) than in patients receiving placebo (60.0%) (p = 0.064). Additionally, Validive was very well tolerated, with the occurrence of adverse events of any type or grade being similar between placebo and Validive treated groups. Patients treated with Validive experienced less nausea and dysphagia compared to placebo. No clinically meaningful decreases in systolic blood pressure or diastolic blood pressure were noted between the placebo and Validive arms. There was no statistical difference in the number of patients having experienced at least one treatment emergent adverse event related to the study treatment between placebo and Validive as summarized in the table below. Two patients in the placebo group and 2 patients in the Validive 50 µg group experienced a serious treatment-emergent adverse event (“STEAE”). No STEAEs were observed in the Validive 100 µg cohort. No patients in the Validive-treated cohorts were discontinued due to study drug. The 2-year survival rate was not statistically different between patients treated with placebo and Validive indicating that Validive did not interfere with primary disease treatment.

All Serious Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Related to Study Drug


MBT=mucoadhesive buccal tablet; n=number of patients studied

The mean overall patient compliance as assessed by the investigators was approximately 90%, and similar across all treatment groups. Overall compliance according to patient diaries was also similar in all treatment groups and consistent with the compliance according to the investigator’s evaluation. The mean incidence of swallowing the MBT was low (4.7%) for all patients based on 7,366 daily MBT applications across all treatment groups.

Our review of the Phase 2 clinical trial data suggests that the effect of Validive was much greater in OPC compared to non-OPC patients. We believe the Phase 2 data along with the mechanism of action of Validive provide a rationale for developing Validive for the treatment of chemoradiation induced SOM in OPC patients as a first indication. The most rapidly growing sub-population of HNC in the U.S. and Europe is OPC, largely driven by HPV+ disease. The oropharynx is the part of the throat at the back of the mouth, which includes the soft palate, the base (rear one third) of the tongue, and the tonsils. HPV+ OPC is a molecularly defined population of HNC characterized by the expression of a protein biomarker, p16 INK4a, and the presence of HPV DNA in the tumor. Evaluation of HPV status is part of the routine clinical assessment of patients with OPC prior to initiating treatment.

Validive Phase 1 Clinical Trial Data

A Phase 1 clinical trial in 36 healthy volunteers comparing the pharmacokinetics of the systemic (oral tablet) clonidine HCl with clonidine MBT (local and sustained delivery of clonidine to oral mucosa and oropharynx – Validive’s formulation) was completed. This was a single-center, Phase 1, single-blind randomized, three-period, three-sequence, single-dose crossover study was conducted between August and November 2015. Healthy volunteers receiving Validive had far less systemic exposure to clonidine with the 50 µg and 100 µg clonidine MBTs (Validive) versus 100 µg clonidine HCl tablets (swallowed oral tablet). In contrast, levels of clonidine in saliva in volunteers receiving a single dose of 50 µg and 100 µg clonidine MBT (Validive) was much greater than saliva levels in volunteers receiving a single dose of 100 µg clonidine HCl tablets. Additionally, no significant effects on blood pressure were observed with the clonidine MBTs (Validive). Blood pressure effects were tested because clonidine is known to lower blood pressure when absorbed systemically. These results are consistent with the expectation that the MBT formulation (Validive) is designed to release clonidine in the oral cavity and oropharynx, as opposed to distributed systemically.

Both Validive 50 µg and 100 µg showed high salivary exposure (as seen above), with low systematic and blood pressure effect (as seen below):



Validive Preclinical Data

 The anti-inflammatory properties of clonidine were studied in a human oral mucosa organotypic culture model, as pro-inflammatory cytokines are believed to drive the development of SOM. Samples of healthy non-keratinized human oral mucosa were obtained from patients undergoing surgery. The experimental oral mucosa pro-inflammatory process was mediated by the addition of neuropeptide substance P (“SP”) to the culture medium. The addition of SP on human gingiva induced a significant increase in TNF-alpha, an important pro-inflammatory molecule involved in mucositis pathogenesis. Overall, on human gingiva stimulated by SP, a concentration dependent decrease in TNF-alpha production was observed with clonidine, which was statistically significant at 3 µg/ml clonidine; see below:

Camsirubicin (5-imino-13-deoxydoxorubicin; formerly MNPR-201, GPX-150)

Our second product candidate, camsirubicin, is a novel analog of doxorubicin which has been designed to reduce the cardiotoxic side effects generated by doxorubicin while retaining anti-cancer activity. A Phase 2 clinical trial for camsirubicin has been completed in patients with advanced (e.g., unresectable or metastatic) soft tissue sarcoma (“ASTS”). Average life expectancy for these patients is 12-15 months. In this study, 52.6% of patients evaluable for tumor progression demonstrated clinical benefit (partial response or stable disease), which was proportional to dose and consistently observed at higher cumulative doses of camsirubicin (>1000 mg/m2). Camsirubicin was very well tolerated in this study and underscored the ability to potentially administer camsirubicin without restriction of cumulative dose in patients with ASTS. Although doxorubicin has been the standard of care treatment for ASTS for over 40 years, doxorubicin is limited to a lifetime cumulative dose maximum of 450 mg/m2. Even if a patient is responding to doxorubicin, their treatment is discontinued once this lifetime cumulative dose has been reached.


13


Camsirubicin is a proprietary doxorubicin analog that is selective for topoisomerase II-alpha. Doxorubicin is used to treat adult and pediatric solid and blood (hematologic) cancers, including soft tissue sarcomas, breast, gastric, ovarian and bladder cancers, leukemias and lymphomas. Despite clinical studies demonstrating the anti-cancer benefit of higher cumulative doses of doxorubicin, the clinical efficacy of doxorubicin has historically been limited by the risk of patients developing irreversible, potentially life-threatening cardiotoxicity. For example, several clinical studies completed in the 1990s demonstrated that concurrent doxorubicin (60 mg/m2, 8 cycles) and paclitaxel gave a 94% overall response rate in patients with metastatic breast cancer but led to 18% of these patients developing congestive heart failure. Reduction of doxorubicin to 4-6 cycles of treatment decreased the incidence of congestive heart failure, but also reduced response rates to 45-55%. In a clinical study looking at dose response, sarcoma patients on the high dose (75 mg/m2) doxorubicin had a response rate of 37% compared to just 18% in the low dose (45 mg/m2) doxorubicin group. With the cumulative dose restriction on doxorubicin, the median progression free survival for ASTS patients is approximately 6 months, with median overall survival of 12-15 months. There is a significant unmet opportunity to develop a replacement for doxorubicin that can be dosed higher and for longer to improve anti-tumor activity

Camsirubicin has been engineered specifically to retain the anticancer activity of doxorubicin while minimizing its toxic effects on the heart. Similar to doxorubicin, the antitumor effects of camsirubicin are mediated through the stabilization of the topoisomerase II complex after a DNA strand break and DNA intercalation leading to tumor cell apoptosis (cell death). Inhibiting the topoisomerase II-alpha isoform is desired for the anti-cancer effect, while inhibiting the topoisomerase II-beta isoform has been demonstrated to mediate, at least in part, the cardiotoxicity associated with all anthracycline drugs currently used in the clinic. Camsirubicin is substantially more selective than doxorubicin for inhibiting topoisomerase II-alpha versus topoisomerase II-beta. This selectivity may partly explain the minimal cardiotoxicity that has been observed for camsirubicin in preclinical and clinical studies to date. We believe that these attributes provide a strong rationale for developing camsirubicin as a monotherapy as well as in combination with other anticancer agents, without potential restrictions on cumulative dose, and offer the opportunity to pursue a large market opportunity for camsirubicin in a broad spectrum of cancer types.

Based on the encouraging clinical results to date, in September 2021, we commenced an open-label, Phase 1b dose escalation trial of camsirubicin plus growth factor support (pegfilgrastim/G-CSF) in the U.S. as first-line treatment for patients with ASTS. The aim is to administer camsirubicin without restricting cumulative dose, thereby potentially improving efficacy by keeping patients who are responding on treatment. These are patients who are not candidates for surgery or radiation treatment, and are largely made up of patients with metastatic disease. Doxorubicin is the current standard of care in the first-line setting for these patients. Although this Phase 1b is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose of camsirubicin, given the historical dose-dependent anti-tumor response repeatedly demonstrated with doxorubicin, efficacy measurements are being tracked in these patients as the dose is increased. In November 2021, the first dose level of camsirubicin had been completed, with a positive recommendation from the trial safety review committee to proceed to the next higher dose level. We are presently enrolling patients at the fifth dose level. The fifth dose level is over twice the highest dose reached in any prior camsirubicin clinical trial (650 mg/m2 versus 265 mg/m2) and no drug-related cardiotoxicity has been observed to date up to the current dose-level. The open-label Phase 1b camsirubicin dose-escalation trial is planning to enroll additional cohorts until the maximum tolerable dose is reached. In November 2022, we presented an abstract and poster of the Phase 1b clinical trial data at the Connective Tissue Oncology Society Annual Meeting in Vancouver, BC. 

We currently anticipate topline results in the camsirubicin Phase 1b clinical trial by the end of 2023 and believe we have sufficient funds to advance the trial through that date. However, if camsirubicin reaches higher dose levels than we are anticipating, the Phase 1b clinical trial may still be dosing patients beyond the end of 2023 and topline results may be deferred. Although we would likely consider this a positive development, it is possible that we would require additional funding to complete an extended Phase 1b clinical trial in this situation. Regardless, additional funding is expected to be required to support further development through and beyond our ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial. 

In June 2019, we entered into a clinical collaboration with Grupo Español de Investigación en Sarcomas (“GEIS”). GEIS is an internationally renowned non-profit organization focused on the research, development and management of clinical trials for sarcoma, that has worked with many of the leading biotech and global pharmaceutical companies. Following completion of our Phase 1b clinical trial, we continue to expect that GEIS will sponsor and lead a multi-country, randomized, open-label Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating camsirubicin head-to-head against doxorubicin, the current first-line treatment for ASTS. The Phase 2 clinical trial is estimated to enroll 170 ASTS patients with the primary endpoint of the trial being progression-free survival, with secondary endpoints including response rate, overall survival and incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. We will provide study drug to GEIS and supplemental financial support for the clinical trial. In addition to camsirubicin’s orphan drug designation in the U.S. by the FDA, the European Commission also granted orphan drug designation for camsirubicin for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma in the EU in November 2019.

Camsirubicin U.S. Market Opportunity

Camsirubicin is an analog of doxorubicin, the first anthracycline to gain FDA approval. Anthracyclines are a class of drugs that are among the most commonly used agents in the treatment of cancer. They have demonstrated efficacy in a wide variety of cancers, including soft tissue sarcoma, breast cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and lymphomas, among other types. Although doxorubicin was approved decades ago, it is still widely used. According to QY Research, in 2020 the global doxorubicin market was $1.1836 billion, and expected to grow at a 7.7% compounded annual growth rate, with projections surpassing $1.8 billion by 2026. According to IQVIA, in 2015 the European Union had over $270 million in sales between doxorubicin HCl and liposomal doxorubicin. Liposomal versions of doxorubicin (e.g., Doxil®) demonstrated that a different formulation of doxorubicin with improved clinical benefits can command a significantly higher price premium compared to generic doxorubicin HCl.

The market opportunity for the first indication, ASTS, is anticipated to be substantial. In 2020, there were an estimated 13,130 new cases of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) in the U.S., and approximately 5,350 deaths from STS, mainly from metastatic disease. Additionally, a few years ago a PDGFR-targeted antibody (olaratumab) was granted accelerated approval based on data from an open label Phase 2 trial. In 2019, the olaratumab Phase 3 trial as first line for advanced soft tissue sarcoma came back negative, resulting in the drug being pulled from the market. Olaratumab had just completed its second full year on the market in the U.S. and abroad before being pulled, reaching over $304 million in sales in 2018, demonstrating the large unmet medical need and considerable market opportunity in ASTS.

Camsirubicin Clinical Data

Several clinical studies of camsirubicin have been completed.

In October 2013, a Phase 1 dose escalation study conducted at the University of Iowa completed enrollment of 24 patients who received one of eight different dose levels of camsirubicin ranging from 14 to 265 mg/m2. No evidence of irreversible cardiotoxicity was observed in any of these patients, including 4 patients who received prior anthracycline (doxorubicin or related molecules) treatment. Stable disease was observed in 55.0% of patients in this Phase 1 study, including 3 out of 4 patients with leiomyosarcoma, which is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that originates in connective tissue and smooth muscle most commonly in the uterus, stomach and small intestine. No growth factor support (G-CSF) was given to patients, and the limiting toxicity was neutropenia.

In January 2015, a multi-center open label single arm Phase 2 clinical trial was initiated in doxorubicin-naïve patients with ASTS. This Phase 2 clinical trial enrolled 22 patients and was completed in August 2016. Camsirubicin was administered intravenously at 265 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for up to 16 doses, with all patients being given growth factor support, and there was clear indication of anticancer activity at this well-tolerated dose and schedule. The majority of patients (52.6%) evaluable for tumor progression demonstrated clinical benefit (stable disease or partial response), which was proportional to dose and consistently observed at higher cumulative doses of camsirubicin (>1000 mg/m2). The progression-free survival at 6 months was 38%, higher than the 6-month PFS of doxorubicin in three of the more recent studies, which showed 23%, 25%, and 33% 6-month PFS for doxorubicin. Camsirubicin was very well tolerated in this study and underscored the potential ability to administer camsirubicin without restriction for cumulative dose in patients with ASTS. Under compassionate use access, one patient received 20 cycles of camsirubicin (cumulative dose 5,300 mg/m2). Apart from one patient who developed febrile neutropenia and severe leukopenia, there were no grade 4 toxicities reported and no grade 3 side effects other than anemia. A transient decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (“LVEF”) was observed in four patients treated with camsirubicin. These decreases in LVEF in camsirubicin treated patients were not serious adverse events and were transient, with LVEF subsequently returning to normal levels in all four subjects. Despite some subjects in this study receiving camsirubicin for up to 20 cycles, effects on cardiac function were of no clinical significance and there was no evidence of irreversible heart failure in any subject.

Camsirubicin Preclinical Data

In preclinical studies, camsirubicin showed a lack of acute as well as chronic functional cardiotoxicity and did not cause the cardiac histopathologic lesions observed with doxorubicin in a chronic rabbit model. Below is in vitro data showing the lack of altered contractility with acute exposure of rabbit atria to camsirubicin, even at high concentrations:

Camsirubicin Cardiac Contractility


Camsirubicin demonstrated limited effect on cardiac contractility, in-line with control

Chronic IV administration of camsirubicin two times per week into rabbits over the course of 13 weeks also showed a lack of cardiotoxicity of camsirubicin when compared to doxorubicin (“DOX”). Echocardiography was performed weekly to obtain left ventricular fractional shortening (“LVFS”) measurements to assess cardiac function. At sacrifice, all six doxorubicin-treated rabbits showed cardiac dysfunction by echocardiography, and LVFS was significantly different from control values (p<0.001). In contrast, none of the camsirubicin-treated rabbits exhibited cardiac dysfunction by echocardiography at any time during the study. Below is a graph of the results:
Weekly Cardiac Echoes


None of the camsirubicin treated rabbits showed significant cardiac dysfunction compared to the vehicle control.

At the conclusion of the 13 weeks of drug dosing, the rabbits were sacrificed, and the left atria were studied to assess cardiac function ex vivo. Atria from the doxorubicin-treated rabbits had impaired cardiac contractility (dF/dt) compared to controls over the entire force-frequency range (1, 2 and 3 Hz). Cardiac contractility for the camsirubicin treated cohort was not significantly different than the vehicle control. Below is a graph of the results:

16

Camsirubicin Cardiac Contractility


Cardiac contractility (dF/dt) of isolated atria at the three contraction rates (1, 2, and 3 contractions/sec) obtained from rabbits chronically infused with either doxorubicin, camsirubicin or saline vehicle (control).

Values are mean, error bars are standard error of the mean (SEM). Camsirubicin demonstrated limited effect on cardiac contractility, in-line with placebo.

Finally, cardiac scoring of the left ventricle walls obtained from the rabbits in this study by a histopathologist showed increased microscopic injury in hearts from doxorubicin-treated rabbits compared to hearts from rabbits administered the vehicle control. Heart tissues from camsirubicin-treated rabbits were the same as the vehicle controls.
MNPR-101 for Radiopharmaceutical Use 

Our third program is based on MNPR-101 (formerly huATN-658), a novel first-in-class humanized monoclonal antibody to the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (“uPAR”), for its use as a radiopharmaceutical in advanced cancers. uPAR is highly expressed in tumors while healthy tissue rarely, if ever, expresses uPAR. The expression of uPAR on diseased cells and tissues allows for selective targeting of MNPR-101, which may be modified to carry imaging and therapeutic payloads.

MNPR-101 represents a novel approach for drug targeting of uPAR as it does not interfere with normal binding of uPA to uPAR. It instead blocks the CD11b (alpha-M)-uPAR interaction. MNPR-101 is on its own believed to have potential activity against many different cancer types because it:


● | is selectively expressed on metastatic tumor, tumor-associated immune, and angiogenic endothelial cells, but not on most normal cells. Several Phase 1 positron emission tomography (“PET”) imaging studies in human advanced cancer patients show that uPAR can only be detected in the tumor and not in normal tissues;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | is central to several extracellular and intracellular oncogenic pathways required for metastasis (inhibiting the uPA system in turn inhibits many other downstream targets, such as MAPK, AKT, MEK, and FAK, that are currently being targeted by other companies); 
● | is expressed on immune cells that allow the tumor to evade recognition by the immune system; 
● | mediates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC); and 
● | has the potential to interfere at several different signaling pathways that converge at uPAR. 


17


Based upon the anticipated non-overlapping toxicity and distinct mechanism of action, we believe MNPR-101 has the potential to be used in combination with existing cancer therapies. The selective expression of uPAR in tumors underpins our expectation that MNPR-101 will be well-tolerated and amenable to a radiopharmaceutical treatment approach. 

MNPR-101-Zr as a Potential Imaging Agent

MNPR-101-Zr is being developed as an imaging agent for the diagnosis and surveillance of multiple cancer types. In February 2023, we announced that based on promising recently generated preclinical imaging results with MNPR-101-Zr showing high uptake across multiple cancer types, we and NorthStar were committing to additional funding with the aim of initiating a first-in-human imaging study with MNPR-101-Zr as early as the end of this year.

MNPR-101-Zr is a zirconium-89 labeled version of MNPR-101. Positron emission tomography (“PET”) imaging of preclinical mouse models for triple-negative breast, colorectal, and pancreatic tumors displayed high and selective uptake of MNPR-101-Zr in these uPAR-expressing tumors.

These proof-of-concept studies provide support for a first-in-human PET imaging study with MNPR-101-Zr and a future therapeutic study using actinium-225 labeled radioimmunotherapeutic version of MNPR-101. Overall, the imaging results demonstrate the potential utility of MNPR-101 as a precision targeting agent for both imaging and therapy in multiple cancer indications.

MNPR-101 RIT 

Also pursuant to our collaboration with NorthStar, we continue to develop potential radioimmunotherapeutics (“RITs”) based on MNPR-101. Our collaboration combines NorthStar’s expertise in the innovative production, supply, and distribution of important medical radioisotopes with our expertise in therapeutic drug development. NorthStar and we have filed provisional composition of matter patents covering the actinium-based radiopharmaceutical drug candidate (MNPR-101-PCTA-Ac-225). We are currently evaluating pathways to initiating a first-in-human study with this drug candidate.
MNPR-202 and Related Analogs 

In June 2021, we entered into a collaboration agreement with the Cancer Science Institute of Singapore (“CSI Singapore”), one of Asia’s premier cancer research centers, at the National University of Singapore (“NUS”) (consistently ranked as one of the world’s top universities) to evaluate the activity of MNPR-202 and related analogs in multiple types of cancer. MNPR-202 was designed to retain the same potentially non-cardiotoxic backbone as camsirubicin but is modified at other positions which may enable it to work in certain cancers that are resistant to camsirubicin and doxorubicin. In December 2020, we announced the issuance of our composition of matter U.S. patent (US10,450,340) covering MNPR-202 and related analogs. CSI Singapore has tested MNPR-202 in preclinical cancer models with promising results and is currently conducting additional preclinical studies with MNPR-202. In December 2022, in collaboration with Dr. Anand Jeyasekharan of CSI Singapore, we presented an abstract and poster of the preclinical data of MNPR-202 at the American Society of Hematology 64th Annual Meeting in New Orleans, LA.
License, Development and Collaboration Agreements

Onxeo S.A.

In June 2016, we executed an agreement with Onxeo S.A., a French public company, which gave us the exclusive option to license (on a world-wide exclusive basis) Validive (clonidine hydrocholoride mucobuccal tablet; clonidine HCI MBT) a mucoadhesive tablet of clonidine based on the Lauriad mucoadhesive technology. The agreement includes clinical, regulatory, developmental and sales milestones that could reach up to $108 million if we achieve all milestones, and escalating royalties from 5% to 10% on net sales. In September 2017, we exercised the option to license Validive from Onxeo for $1 million, but as of March 10, 2023, we have not been required to pay Onxeo any other funds under the agreement. We will need to raise significant funds or enter into a collaboration partnership to support the completion of clinical development and potential marketing approval of Validive.

18


Under the agreement, we are required to pay royalties to Onxeo on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the later of (1) the date when a given product is no longer within the scope of a patent claim in the country of sale or manufacture, (2) the expiry of any extended exclusivity period in the relevant country (such as orphan drug exclusivity, pediatric exclusivity, new chemical entity exclusivity, or other exclusivity granted beyond the expiry of the relevant patent), or (3) a specific time period after the first commercial sale of the product in such country. In most countries, including the U.S., the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country, not taking into consideration any potential patent term adjustment that may be filed in the future or any regulatory extensions that may be obtained. The royalty termination provision pursuant to (3) described above is shorter than 20 years and is the least likely cause of termination of royalty payments.

The Onxeo license agreement does not have a pre-determined term, but expires on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis; that is, the agreement expires with respect to a given product in a given country whenever our royalty payment obligations with respect to such product have expired. The agreement may also be terminated early for cause if either we or Onxeo materially breach the agreement, or if either we or Onxeo become insolvent. We may also choose to terminate the agreement, either in its entirety or as to a certain product and a certain country, by providing Onxeo with advance notice.

Grupo Español de Investigación en Sarcomas (“GEIS”)

In June 2019, we executed a clinical collaboration with GEIS for the development of camsirubicin in patients with ASTS. Following completion of the Phase 1b clinical trial in the U.S. that we initiated in the third quarter of 2021 with the first patient dosed in October 2021, we continue to expect that GEIS will sponsor and lead a multi-country, randomized, open-label Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate camsirubicin head-to-head against doxorubicin, the current first-line treatment for ASTS. We will provide study drug and supplemental financial support for the clinical trial. =For the three months ended March 31, 2021, we incurred $0.3 million in expenses related to the GEIS collaboration including clinical material manufacturing-related expense, clinical consulting, database management expenses and intellectual property expenses.  We can terminate the agreement by providing GEIS with advance notice, and without affecting our rights and ownership to any related intellectual property or clinical data. In the second quarter of 2021, due to regulatory delays in Spain, we decided to conduct an open-label Phase 1b clinical trial of camsirubicin in the U.S., therefore no expenses were incurred related to the GEIS collaboration beyond March 31, 2021. 

XOMA Ltd.

To humanize our MNPR-101 antibody, we have taken a non-exclusive license to XOMA (US) LLC’s humanization technology and know-how. Humanization involves replacing most of the non-critical parts of the mouse sequence of an antibody with the human sequence to minimize the ability of the human immune system to recognize this antibody as foreign. As such, MNPR-101 has been engineered to be 95% human sequence using the XOMA technology. Under the terms of the license, we are to pay only upon developmental and sales milestone achievements which could reach up to $14.925 million if we achieve all milestones. The agreement does not require the payment of sales royalties. There can be no assurance that we will reach any milestones. As of March 10, 2023, we had not reached any milestones and had not been required to pay XOMA Ltd. any funds under this license agreement. The first milestone payment is payable upon first dosing of a human patient in a Phase 2 clinical trial.

Intellectual Property Portfolio and Exclusivity

An important part of our strategy is obtaining patent protection to help preserve the proprietary nature of our product candidates, and to prevent others from developing competitive agents that are similar. Our patent portfolio includes issued patents and pending patent applications in the U.S. and in foreign countries. Our general practice is to seek patent protection in major markets worldwide.
Validive

We license all intellectual property related to Validive from Onxeo S.A., a French public company. See “Business – License, Development and Collaboration Agreements”. Validive is covered by 57 issued patents in 31 jurisdictions, including the U.S., EU, Japan, and other Asian countries, and has orphan drug designation in the EU as well as Fast Track designation from the FDA. These patents are method of use patents that cover the use of Validive to prevent and/or treat inflammation and inflammatory pain of the mucosa including cancer therapy-induced mucositis; the use of clonidine or clonidine derivatives for the prevention or treatment of adverse side effects of chemotherapy; and clonidine and/or clonidine derivatives for use in the prevention of skin injury resulting from radiotherapy, and have been assigned to us pursuant to our license agreement with Onxeo. The latest patent expires in 2035 not accounting for possible extensions.

19


In November 2020, we announced a series of recently issued patents for Validive (clonidine HCl mucobuccal tablet). These patents, including U.S. Patent No. 10,675,271, provide claims covering “Clonidine and/or clonidine derivatives for use in the prevention and/or treatment of adverse side effects of chemotherapy”. These patents expand the potential use of Validive in cancer patients, beyond the earlier allowed claims for the prevention of oral mucositis in patients receiving CRT. Specifically, they provide protection for the potential ability of Validive to prevent or treat common chemotherapy-associated side effects such as asthenia and fatigue and would provide protection should we determine in the future to conduct additional Validive development activities related to adverse side effects of chemotherapy beyond oropharyngeal cancer.

Camsirubicin

Camsirubicin (GPX-150) is covered by manufacturing process patents. We have a patent for chemical synthesis technology that efficiently converts cardiotoxic “13-keto” anthracyclines such as doxorubicin, daunorubicin, epirubicin, and idarubicin into novel, patentable, and most likely less-cardiotoxic “5-imino-13-deoxy” analogs. A novel chemical composition of an intermediate for this synthesis is also patented. In addition, we have a patent covering the combination of camsirubicin with paclitaxel for the treatment of cancer, plus covering the method of use of these two drugs for this purpose. Our camsirubicin patent portfolio contains eight issued U.S. patents (two of which have expired) and one U.S. pending patent application. We have certain corresponding patents and applications in twenty-nine foreign jurisdictions, including the U.S., EU, Japan, and other Asian countries. The process patents for the synthesis of camsirubicin intermediates will expire in 2024 and the patents covering the combination use of camsirubicin and its analogs with taxanes will expire in 2026. The patent covering novel, potentially more potent analogs of camsirubicin expires in 2038. We may pursue patent term extensions where appropriate. We have obtained patent protection around the intermediates and process used to manufacture camsirubicin and we expect to obtain Hatch-Waxman exclusivity (applicable to new chemical entities) for 5 years that will prevent generic competition. We have also obtained U.S. and EU orphan drug status in soft tissue sarcoma with additional orphan cancer indications expected to follow.

In December 2020, we announced the issuance of a U.S. patent (US 10,450,340) covering compositions of matter (2-pyrrilino camsirubicin) for a novel family of camsirubicin analogs. This patent, which expands the Company’s camsirubicin intellectual property portfolio, is expected to expire in 2038 not including any patent term extensions. The patent broadens our camsirubicin portfolio and creates a pipeline that has been designed to retain the potentially favorable non-cardiotoxic chemical backbone of camsirubicin and the potent broad-spectrum antitumor activity of doxorubicin. Further, preclinical evidence suggests that this new family of 2-pyrrilino camsirubicin analogs could be active in doxorubicin-resistant tumor cells which may enable use in cancer types beyond those possible with camsirubicin.

MNPR-101

Our patent portfolio for our MNPR-101 antibody (huATN-658), as well as its epitope, consists of two issued U.S. composition of matter and their methods of use patents and corresponding (granted and pending) patents and patent applications in twenty-two foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union, Japan, and other Asian countries. These patents are owned by us. The patents covering the composition of matter of MNPR-101 will expire in 2025 and the patents covering the MNPR-101 epitope will expire in 2027. Being a novel biologic, it is eligible for 12 years of exclusivity in the U.S. under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (“BPCI Act”), and it will benefit from varying durations of similar exclusivity in numerous other countries. The Radio-Immuno-Therapeutic derivative of MNPR-101 (uPRIT) patent, if granted expires in 2041.

Patent life determination depends on the date of filing of the application and other factors as promulgated under the patent laws. In most countries, including the U.S., the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date (the priority date) of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country, not taking into consideration any potential patent term adjustment that may be filed in the future or any regulatory extensions that may be obtained. Some of our patents are currently near expiration and we may pursue patent term extensions for these where appropriate. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to our Intellectual Property”.

MNPR-101 for Radiopharmaceutical Use

In collaboration with NorthStar, we filed a provisional patent application entitled “Precision Radioimmunotherapeutic Targeting of the Urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor (uPAR) for Treatment of Severe COVID-19 Disease” with the USPTO on June 15, 2020. A full international application (International Application Number PCT/US2021/037416) that claims priority to the provisional filing date was filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) on June 15, 2021. This application covers novel compositions and uses of cytotoxic radioisotopes attached to antibodies that bind to uPAR, thereby creating precision targeted radiotherapeutics, also known as uPRITs, for the treatment of severe COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases. Advanced COVID-19 patients frequently develop severe, life-threatening, pulmonary inflammation as a result of a viral induced cytokine storm. The development of this cytokine storm is associated with a high rate of mortality in severe COVID-19 patients, even when oxygen support and mechanical ventilation are utilized. uPRITs have been designed with the goal of selectively eradicating the aberrantly activated immune cells responsible for causing cytokine storm and its harmful systemic effects. The co-inventors of the provisional patent application are James Harvey, Chief Scientific Officer of NorthStar, and Andrew P. Mazar, former Monopar Chief Scientific Officer.

In May 2021, we and NorthStar filed a provisional patent application with the USPTO titled “Bio-Targeted Radiopharmaceutical Compositions Containing Ac-225 and Methods of Preparation.” Radiopharmaceutical therapy is a promising approach to treat cancer and other diseases using radioactive isotopes bound with proteins/antibodies to target and kill cells. If validated through further evaluation, it could potentially improve efficacy and safety and enhance manufacturing efficiency of actinium-based radiopharmaceuticals, the full potential of which are presently constrained by the price and scarcity of Ac-225.

Also in May 2021, we and NorthStar filed a provisional composition of matter patent application titled “Urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor-Targeted Radiopharmaceutical” covering a radiotherapeutic consisting of our proprietary antibody MNPR-101 bound to Ac-225 via the isotope binding agent PCTA. This RIT demonstrated 98% radiochemical purity and high stability and has the potential to be a highly selective, potent treatment for a variety of cancers, severe COVID-19, and other diseases characterized by aberrant uPA receptor expression.

Manufacturing

We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production or testing of Validive, camsirubicin, MNPR-101, MNPR-101-Zr, MPNR-101 RITs or MNPR-202, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We presently depend on third-party contract manufacturers for all our required raw materials, Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (“API”), and finished drug products for our preclinical and clinical studies. Both COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine war, and related impacts on inflation and supply chain logistics, may impact the cost and delay shipping of supplies for our clinical materials manufacturing due to the rising cost of fuel and sanctions that may delay global shipping. We have completed manufacturing of the clinical batches of drug product for Validive that are currently being utilized in our ongoing Phase 2b/3 VOICE clinical trial and for camsirubicin which are being used in our ongoing Phase 1b dose-escalation camsirubicin clinical trial. We are in the midst of manufacturing more camsirubicin for the clinical trials. We continue to develop MNPR-101-Zr, MNPR-101 RIT and MNPR-202 for potential scale-up.
Sales and Marketing

In light of our stage of corporate development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. We have retained worldwide commercial rights for our product candidates. If our product candidates receive marketing approval, we plan to commercialize them in the U.S. and potentially in Europe with our own focused, specialty sales force to be developed. We would expect to conduct most of the buildout of this organization following approval in the U.S. or following similar marketing authorizations in Europe of any of our product candidates. We expect to explore commercialization of Validive and potentially other product candidates in certain markets outside the U.S., including the EU, utilizing a variety of collaboration, distribution and other sales and marketing arrangements with one or more third parties.

21

Oncology Market Competition

The pharmaceutical industry in general, and the oncology therapeutics sector in particular, are characterized by intense competition. We face competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, many of which are larger and better financed than us. We also face competition in our efforts to develop and commercialize new oncology therapeutics from academic and government laboratories. The therapeutics that we are developing, if successfully commercialized, will have to compete with existing therapeutics already on the market and novel therapeutics currently in development, as well as new therapeutics that may be discovered and developed in the future. Our product candidates will also have to compete with alternate treatment modalities, such as improvements in radiation treatments, which are also subject to continual innovation and improvement. Additional information can be found in the section entitled “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Industry.”
Validive

There is no effective standard of care or FDA approved preventive or therapeutic treatment for patients that develop chemoradiation-induced SOM. Only symptomatic treatments such as opioids and palliative mouthwashes are available but have no effect on the occurrence, time to onset, or duration of SOM. Our primary competitor is a dismutase mimetic which recently completed its Phase 3 clinical development including submission to the FDA for marketing approval. The dismutase mimetic is administered through a daily 60-minute intravenous (“IV”) infusion to be completed within an hour before each radiation treatment. Validive, in comparison, is an easy to use, once daily self-administered oral/buccal tablet that acts locally at the sites of SOM.
Camsirubicin

We believe our camsirubicin program, if approved, could replace doxorubicin as the first-line treatment for ASTS. In addition, we believe that camsirubicin would compete with a number of currently available anthracycline-based drugs on the market for other cancer indications. These are largely derivatives of doxorubicin, or reformulations of doxorubicin such as liposomal doxorubicin (e.g., Doxil, sold by Johnson & Johnson). All of these have the issue of cardiotoxicity. In addition to approved products, there are a number of product candidates in development, largely as new formulations or derivatives of doxorubicin.

MNPR-101 for Radiopharmaceutical Use and MNPR-202

Our MNPR-101-Zr, MNPR-101 RIT and MNPR-202 programs are in the early stages of development and the most susceptible to all of the competitive factors listed in the first paragraph of this section on Oncology Market Competition.

Government Regulation and Product Approval

Government authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. The pharmaceutical product candidates that we develop must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Clinical Development and Regulatory Approval”.
U.S. Pharmaceutical Product Development Process

In the U.S., the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and implementing regulations. Pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial enforcement. FDA enforcement could result in refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a non-biological pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:

22


● | Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”), and other applicable regulations; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”), which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin; 
● | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to the FDA’s current Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”), to establish the safety, efficacy and optimum dose of the proposed pharmaceutical product for its intended use;
● | Submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) or Biologics License Application (“BLA”), for a new pharmaceutical product; 


● | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the pharmaceutical product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice standards (“cGMP:”), to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the pharmaceutical product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | FDA audits of the preclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; 
● | FDA review and approval of the NDA; and 
● | Fulfillment of FDA post-marketing requirements, if any. 


The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources, and approvals are inherently uncertain. 

Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the pharmaceutical product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as in-vitro and animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the pharmaceutical product candidate. These early proof-of-principle studies are done using sound scientific procedures and thorough documentation. The conduct of single and repeat dose toxicology and toxicokinetic studies in animals must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA has concerns and notifies the sponsor. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. If resolution cannot be reached within the 30-day review period, either the FDA places the IND on clinical hold, or the sponsor withdraws the application. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a pharmaceutical product candidate at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, it is not certain that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such clinical studies.

During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA or BLA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the sponsor to ask specific questions to the FDA, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end of Phase 2 meeting to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical (registration) trial(s) that they believe will support approval of the new drug. A sponsor may be able to request a Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”), the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analyses that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim.

According to FDA guidance for industry on the SPA process, a sponsor which meets the prerequisites may make a specific request for a SPA and provide information regarding the design and size of the proposed clinical trial. The FDA’s goal is to evaluate the protocol within 45 days of the request to assess whether the proposed trial is adequate, and that evaluation may result in discussions and a request for additional information. A SPA request must be made before the proposed trial begins, and all open issues must be resolved before the trial begins. If a written agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the IND record. The agreement will be binding on the FDA and may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the drug was identified after the testing began.

Clinical studies involve the administration of the pharmaceutical product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the clinical study sponsor’s control. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, how the results will be analyzed and presented and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical studies must be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) guidelines. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), at, or servicing, each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and is tasked with considering such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed.

Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:


● | Phase 1. The pharmaceutical product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase 2. The pharmaceutical product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases, to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule and to identify patient populations with specific characteristics where the pharmaceutical product may be more effective. 
● | Phase 3. Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. The studies must be well-controlled and usually include a control arm for comparison. One or two Phase 3 studies are required by the FDA for an NDA or BLA approval, depending on the disease severity and other available treatment options. 
● | Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. 
● | Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the pharmaceutical product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.


Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the pharmaceutical product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the pharmaceutical product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final pharmaceutical product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the pharmaceutical product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

U.S. Review and Approval Processes

The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the pharmaceutical product, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.

In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), an NDA, BLA or a supplement thereof must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the pharmaceutical product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any pharmaceutical product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.

The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA or BLA for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA or BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), the FDA has 10 months in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA or BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months for a priority NDA or BLA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs or BLAs. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or if the NDA or BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.

After the NDA or BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA or BLA application to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel pharmaceutical products or pharmaceutical products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the pharmaceutical product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”), is necessary to assure the safe use of the pharmaceutical product. If the FDA concludes that a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA or BLA without a REMS, if required.

Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites as well as the site where the pharmaceutical product is manufactured to assure compliance with GCP and cGMP. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. In addition, the FDA will require the review and approval of product labeling.

The NDA and BLA review and approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than the sponsor interprets the same data. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA or BLA. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.


25


If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical studies designed to further assess pharmaceutical product safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.

Expedited Development and Review Programs

The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new pharmaceutical products that meet certain criteria. Validive has Fast Track designation. New pharmaceutical products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. The Fast Track designation must be requested by the sponsor. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. With a Fast Track designated product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA or BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA or BLA, if the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA or BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable and if the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA.

Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing approval, including a Fast Track program, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new pharmaceutical product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Pharmaceutical products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that the products may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a pharmaceutical product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.

Breakthrough Therapy Designation

The FDA is also required to expedite the development and review of the application for approval of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request that the FDA designate the product candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the product candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. Validive, camsirubicin and MNPR-101 may all be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation pending additional data.
European Union Drug Review and Approval

In the European Economic Area (“EEA”) (which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (“MA”). There are two types of MA:

26


The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the CHMP, or Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, of the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes and auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.

National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in other Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.

PRIME Designation

The EMA launched its PRIME regulatory initiative to enhance support for the development of therapies that target an unmet medical need. The initiative focuses on drugs that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments, or benefit patients with no treatment options. These therapies are considered priority medicines within the EU. Through PRIME, the EMA offers early, proactive and enhanced support to drug developers to optimize the generation of robust data on a therapy’s benefits and risks and enable accelerated assessment of drug applications. MNPR-101 may be eligible for PRIME designation.

Post-Approval Requirements

Any pharmaceutical products for which a sponsor receives FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA and FTC promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, prohibitions on promoting pharmaceutical products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the pharmaceutical product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, actions by the U.S. Department of Justice and/or U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available pharmaceutical products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not directly or indirectly market or promote such off-label uses.

Manufacturers of FDA approved products are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Pharmaceutical product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved pharmaceutical products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk minimization action plans and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S. and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government payers such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a pharmaceutical product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the pharmaceutical product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific pharmaceutical products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved pharmaceutical products for a particular indication. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. A payer’s decision to provide coverage for a pharmaceutical product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved.

In 2003, the federal government enacted legislation providing a partial prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients, which became effective at the beginning of 2006. However, to obtain payments under this program, a company would be required to sell products to Medicare recipients through prescription drug plans operating pursuant to this legislation. As part of their participation in the Medicare prescription drug program, these plans negotiate discounted prices for prescription drugs. Federal, state and local governments in the U.S. continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of health care costs, including the requirement to reduce the price of certain prescription drugs. Future legislation and regulations could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the product candidates that we are developing.

Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Community, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed upon. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular pharmaceutical product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.

International Regulation

In addition to regulations in the U.S., there are a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical studies and commercial sales and distribution of our future product candidates. Whether or not FDA approval is obtained for a product, approval of a product must be obtained by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before clinical studies or marketing of the product can commence in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. In addition, certain regulatory authorities in select countries may require us to repeat previously conducted preclinical and/or clinical studies under specific criteria for approval in their respective country which may delay and/or greatly increase the cost of approval in certain markets targeted for approval by us.

Under E.U. regulatory systems, marketing applications for pharmaceutical products must be submitted under a centralized procedure to the EMA. The centralized procedure provides for the granting of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all E.U. member states. The EMA also has designations for Orphan Drugs, which, if applicable, can provide for faster review, lower fees and more access to advice during drug development. While the marketing authorization in the European Union is centralized, the system for clinical studies (application, review and requirements) is handled by each individual country. Approval to run a clinical study in one country does not guarantee approval in any other country. The pharmaceutical industry in Canada is regulated by Health Canada. A New Drug Submission (“NDS”) is the equivalent of a U.S. NDA and must be filed to obtain approval to market a pharmaceutical product in Canada. Marketing regulations and reimbursement are subject to national and provincial laws. In Japan, applications for approval to manufacture and market new drugs must be approved by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Nonclinical and clinical studies must meet the requirements of Japanese laws. Results from clinical studies conducted outside of Japan must be supplemented with at least a bridging clinical study conducted in Japanese patients.


28


In addition to regulations in Europe, Canada, Japan and the U.S., there are a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical studies, commercial distribution and reimbursement of future product candidates which we may be subject to as we pursue regulatory approval and commercialization of Validive, camsirubicin, MNPR-101, or any future product candidates internationally.
