Company Overview
Overview
Who We Are
Porch Group is a leading vertical software company reinventing the home services and insurance industries. Porch Group’s mission is to partner with home service companies and together, delight homeowners from moving to improving and everything in between, Porch Group provides software and services to approximately 30,900 companies and small businesses, such as home inspectors, mortgage companies and loan officers, title companies, moving companies, real estate agencies, utility companies, roofers, insurance agencies, and others. Porch Group helps these service providers grow their business and improve their customer experience. Through these companies, Porch Group also gets introduced to their customers to help with other services, including insurance, to make the move and home maintenance simpler.
Porch Group makes the moving process easier for homebuyers by helping them save time and make better decisions about critical services, including insurance, warranty, moving, security, TV/Internet, home repair and improvement. The Company provides home and personal property insurance policies through its own underwriting operations in 21 states and across the U.S. with its wholly-owned Insurance Agency.
Our multi-faceted value proposition resonates with a broad customer demographic, regardless of home price, income level, geographic location or age. We acquire our customers through a variety of channels, including at the time of a real estate transaction through third parties, direct-to-consumer (“DTC”), and leads from other Porch Group businesses. 
Porch Group has two reportable segments: the Vertical Software segment and the Insurance segment.
Porch Group’s Vertical Software segment provides software and services to home services companies. Through these relationships, Porch earns fees, and gains a competitive advantage through unique and early access to homebuyers and homeowners. This early access allows Porch to assist homebuyers and homeowners with critical moving services. In turn, Porch’s platform drives demand for other services. The Vertical Software segment has three types of customers: (1) home services companies, such as home inspectors, mortgage companies and loan officers, and title companies, for whom Porch provides software and services to help them make their businesses run more efficiently and grow; (2) consumers, such as homebuyers and homeowners, whom Porch assists with the comparison and provision of various home services, such as moving, security, TV/Internet, and home repair and improvement; and (3) service providers, such as moving companies, security companies, title companies, mortgage companies and TV/Internet providers, who pay Porch for new customer sign-ups.
Porch Group’s Insurance segment offers various property-related insurance policies through our risk-bearing carrier, independent agency, and risk-bearing home warranty companies. We earn insurance policy premiums collected from insured homeowners for our insurance products, policy fees when policies are sold and renewed, and commissions when we cede premiums to reinsurance companies. Additionally, when we sell a homeowner an insurance policy through a carrier other than our own, these third-party insurance companies pay new business and renewal commissions to Porch’s insurance agency. The Insurance segment also includes home warranty, from which Porch receives premiums paid by homeowners for Porch’s home warranty products.
Porch Group operates under several brands in both the Vertical Software and Insurance segments, such as:

The Porch Platform
Porch Group provides software and services to home services companies, and, through these relationships, gains a competitive advantage through unique and early access to homebuyers and homeowners, as well as unique insights to property data. Porch then assists homebuyers and homeowners with critical services such as insurance and moving. In turn, Porch’s platform drives demand back to companies using Porch’s software as part of our value proposition.
​

​
Software and Services for Home Services Companies
Porch Group’s platform provides home services companies with software and services to help them grow their business and provide a better customer experience. This value proposition can be divided into three components.
First, Porch Group offers industry-leading vertical-specific software that includes a wide range of functionality required by home services companies, e.g., home inspectors, mortgage companies, title companies, roofers, and moving services providers to run a successful business. These software solutions, which vary by industry, include features such as configurable dashboards, calendars and scheduling, online booking, payment processing, dispatch and routing optimization, customer relations and communications, point of sale interfaces, flexible reporting, industry integrations, report writing, quoting and more. Companies use this software for their customers and transactions, managing their employees and tracking their partners. The depth of functionality varies among industry-specific products. Because this software is used in so many aspects of day-to-day management by home services companies such as home inspectors, Porch sees high retention rates among our software customers.
Second, Porch offers a concierge service that home services companies can then offer to their end customers to improve the moving and home improvement experience. Porch’s Moving Concierge service assists the home services company’s end customer with the remaining aspects of their move and, in the future, with ongoing home maintenance. through the use of a customer self-service dashboard in which the customer manages their moving “to do” list. In addition, a Moving Concierge representative will contact the customer to talk about their home inspection, answer questions, collect a review for the company, and chart out all upcoming services with which Porch can assist, including comparing prices and making decisions about critical services such as insurance (as both a licensed, nationwide insurance agent and a carrier in certain states), moving, security, and TV/Internet. Porch’s Moving Concierge service creates a positive end-customer experience that can benefit the home services company. In 2022, Porch launched the Porch smartphone app to enhance and expand the customer experience and home-related features, including recall monitoring for appliances and other systems, as well as to do lists for ongoing home projects.

Third, Porch can help home services companies grow their business through new customer acquisition. Porch does this through its various digital and concierge experiences and marketing solutions. Home services companies can pay for Porch’s software and specific modules with business-to-business (“B2B”) SaaS fees. Through a variety of products Porch can also get introduced to these companies’ consumers who are often in the process of buying a home. This allows Porch Group to generate business-to-business-to-customer (“B2B2C”) transaction fees by offering high-value products and services such as insurance or warranty contracts to these end customers. We believe the combination of B2B SaaS fees and B2B2C transaction revenue is compelling; it allows Porch Group to achieve a very strong home services company lifetime value to acquisition cost ratio.
Consumer Services
Porch Group connects consumers with home services companies nationwide and offers a full range of products and services where homeowners can, among other things: (1) compare and buy home insurance and warranty policies (along with auto, flood and umbrella policies from third party carriers) with competitive rates and coverage; (2) arrange for moving labor to load or unload a truck or full-service, long-distance movers; (3) discover and install home automation and security systems; (4) compare and purchase Internet and television options for their new home; (5) book small handyman jobs at fixed, upfront prices, and more.
Our initial focus is on the move stage of the homeowner’s journey given the concentration of high-value services that are purchased during this time. According to a survey conducted by OnePoll, moving was one of the most highly stressful moments in a consumer’s life. Across each of these services, Porch helps the consumer quickly and easily select the right products for them. For example, after helping the consumer quickly compare a large set of options for homeowner’s insurance for their new home, we will bind coverage as a licensed insurance agent and connect it to the homebuyer’s mortgage. In the 21 states where we operate as a carrier, we can offer consumers our own homeowners insurance products. Additionally, Porch offers home warranty products to protect critical systems and appliances typically not covered under homeowners’ insurance.
Upon engaging with the homeowner at the move stage and thereafter, we broaden the scope of our engagement by providing consumers with tools and resources to help make homeownership easy. Porch’s smartphone app provides recall monitoring for appliances and other home systems, as well as to do list tracking, which information we seek to obtain from the home inspection report when applicable. Homeowners can use Porch to find local professionals to complete most types of home maintenance, repair and improvement projects. Professionals can create profiles on Porch.com, but we also partner with large service provider companies and large networks of service providers, allowing us to provide assistance to consumers most efficiently.
Our Industry
The home is foundational to the American experience. According to data from the National Association of Realtors and the U.S. Census Bureau, there were 5.03 million existing homes sold and approximately 644,000 newly constructed homes sold in the United States in 20221. The U.S. home services market is composed of millions of companies, the majority of which are small businesses operating in fragmented markets, according to the U.S. Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy. For consumers, moving and maintenance can be full of pitfalls and headaches. Porch Group seeks to simplify the home and homeownership by providing software and services to home services companies and connecting homeowners to high-quality services throughout the home lifecycle. In doing so, Porch Group conducts its business across a broad total addressable market (“TAM”) beyond its software and service offerings, consisting of moving services, property and casualty (“P&C”) insurance, contractor services, and mover marketing with an estimated total value of $362 billion. This TAM is based on the services Porch offers today, with ample opportunity for expansion of Porch’s U.S. addressable market.

A summary of the TAM by significant type of service is as follows (see sections below for the details):

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
--------------------------------------------------+---+---------------+------
​ | ​ | TAM 
​ | ​ | (in billions)
Services: | ​ | ​ | ​ 
Contractor services | ​ | $ | 195.0
Property and casualty insurance and home warranty | ​ | ​ | 149.7
Mover marketing | ​ | ​ | 10.8 
Moving services | ​ | ​ | 4.7 
Total revenue | ​ | $ | 360.2

​
Property and Casualty (P&C) Insurance and Home Warranty
Through its wholly-owned licensed insurance agency, EIG, Porch Group serves customers in the P&C home, auto, flood, and umbrella insurance market, selling third-party insurance policies in all 50 states. In addition, Porch Group operates a risk-bearing insurance carrier, HOA, a leading property and casualty insurance company focused on products in the residential homeowner space. Based on U.S. home insurance annual revenues of $120 billion plus U.S. auto insurance annual revenues of $252 billion, we believe the P&C home and auto insurance TAM is approximately $145 billion.2 In the second quarter of 2022, Porch Group began operating a wholly-owned captive reinsurer, Porticus Re, which seeks to efficiently reinsure Porch Group affiliates.
​
With the acquisitions of AHP and RWS, the Company now operates its own home warranty business, which market is estimated to be worth $4.7 billion for the combined home warranty and utility service line3.
​
Moving Services
Porch Group provides three primary moving services that support homeowners during the moving process: direct moving services, security installations, TV/Internet and solar installations. Based on U.S. Census Bureau data and company estimates, we believe the overall addressable opportunity for us in these three service offerings in the U.S. to be approximately $4.7 billion.
Contractor Services
Contractor services is another large portion of Porch Group’s TAM with an estimated size of approximately $195 billion. This estimate is based on our estimate of a greater than $650 billion valuation of the home improvement market.
Mover Marketing
Mover Marketing represents Porch Group’s opportunity to sell marketing technology and services that help advertisers retain existing customers and attract new customers at key moments in the homeownership journey, such as during the home buying process. We estimate this TAM in the U.S. as $10.8 billion.
​
Trends and Growth in the Housing and Home Maintenance Sectors
Home Sales
As a home services platform that provides core software and services to approximately 30,900 companies and small businesses, Porch Group’s revenue is in part linked to the volume of home sales. Throughout 2022, the U.S housing market was impacted by a rapid increase in interest rates, increased home sales prices, and general economic uncertainty, which resulted in a 17.8% decrease in existing home sales volumes. For the full year, 2022, the volume of existing home 


2 According to IBISWorld 2021 full year data.

sales volumes totaled 5.03 million, per the National Association of Realtors. Aside from these headwinds to the housing market in 2022, America has historically been a very mobile country, with the average American homeowner moving once every 10 years, according to the National Association of Realtors.
Approximately 20% of our revenue is directly related to housing market transactions, primarily from moving services.
Buying a Home and Moving Is Complex
Moving is considered one of the most stressful life events. A growing list of factors go into choosing a home, including, but not limited to, home affordability, safety, quality of schools and proximity to parks, recreational facilities, health centers and outdoor space. When purchasers do find the right home, they might face a competitive process where their bid is ultimately rejected. Once their bid is accepted, home buyers typically get a home inspection and must finalize their mortgage by meeting lender requirements including getting homeowners insurance.
With the house purchase offer accepted and home inspection completed, homebuyers then must deal with the complexity of and logistics of moving. Pre-move considerations include, but are not limited to, researching moving services, visiting new communities, booking rentals, reserving storage units, coordinating with movers on packing, transferring utilities, home cleaning, completing a change of address, purchasing home insurance, and purchasing a home warranty. Within the moving company market alone, according to the American Trucking Associations, in 2021, there were over 16,500 moving and storage businesses to choose from. Post-move considerations include, but are not limited to, unpacking, cleaning the new house, scheduling essential home improvements listed in the inspection report, changing locks, transferring medical records, registering vehicles, purchasing Internet and setting up a security system. All of these considerations make moving a stressful and arduous process.
Porch Group strives to make the move simpler through its Moving Concierge and related services. Homebuyers using Porch Group’s self-service dashboard can facilitate the purchasing of insurance, compare prices for movers, provision other move-related services, and manage their moving checklist. 
Increasing Home Improvement Spending
After helping consumers with their move, Porch Group stays in touch with the homeowner to help with home management, and all maintenance and improvement projects. We expect that the continued growth of the home improvement spending market will impact Porch Group’s future revenues.
According to Houzz market research reports, over half of homeowners plans to tackle a home renovation project in 2022, and median spend on renovation projects was $18,000. Porch Group helps make the process of finding a vetted professional for these projects easy, while offering transparent pricing.
According to Technavio, online on-demand home services are expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of over 61% from 2022 to 2027. The digitally minded millennial and Gen Z generations are driving this trend, entering the home ownership market and hiring home services professionals online. Home service professionals experiencing the benefits and scalability of connecting and engaging with consumers online, including reaching wider or targeted audiences, improving conversion rates, reducing acquisition costs, and tracking performance of marketing investments, are expected to invest more into digital offerings over time.
Our Competitive Strengths
Leading Software with approximately 30,900 Companies and Small Businesses across a Diverse Set of Industries
Porch Group owns several leading software platform brands including ISN, Palm-Tech, and Home Inspector Pro for home inspectors, Floify for mortgage companies and loan officers, Rynoh for title companies, HireAHelperTM for moving companies, and iRoofing for roofers. Porch Group provides software that helps these companies manage and 

10



grow their business such as CRM, ERP and POS modules to approximately 30,900 companies and small businesses across a number of home services verticals utilizing these various software brands.
Early Access to Demand
Porch Group’s early access to homebuyers through companies using Porch’s software allows us to connect with homebuyers before others and assist in their moving journey prior to completing many large purchasing decisions. Porch Group receives access to these homebuyers through the Porch software platform from the various verticals utilizing Porch’s various software brands. In addition, in certain verticals such as home inspection, companies may provide Porch with access and an introduction to the consumer; here Porch generates additional revenue via B2B2C transactions. This gives Porch the opportunity to market and offer services to these customers up to and before six weeks in advance of their move. Porch’s customer access model represents an extremely valuable marketing tool and customer acquisition platform for home services providers, who typically rely on a change of address request that occurs near the end of the moving journey to reach out to homebuyers.
Porch Group’s software for home inspectors is the software of choice for a significant portion of inspection companies including most of the largest inspection companies in the U.S. Based on our estimates, these inspection companies complete more than 40% of U.S. home inspections through Porch Group’s software and services.
Through research and development, Porch Group continues to invest in and strengthen the software advantage of its software offerings. Moreover, we expect to increase the percentage of U.S. homebuyers available through its customer access model through the broad rollout of the Porch smartphone app, expanding sales efforts, and by developing new products and tools for its current verticals.
Proprietary Data and Analytics
Through the services it offers, Porch Group has access to a trove of proprietary data on homebuyers and their homes. For example, Porch Group has access to home inspection reports and the data these provide around the home. Using this homebuyer and home data, Porch intends to continue its investment in data science and analytics to better price insurance policies, provide more convenient services to homebuyers and improve service provider marketing opportunities. For example, Porch believes that its data can improve our pricing algorithms for homeowners insurance to lower prices for low-risk homes, as well as help improve Porch’s ability to predict a variety of events, including the timing and likelihood of specific purchase decisions around the home, a mover’s likelihood of switching insurance carriers or the probability and severity of home insurance and home warranty claims. Porch Group Media provides software and data solutions to help brands and small and medium-sized businesses acquire new customers and improve their marketing.
Comprehensive Service Offering
Porch Group offers a unique breadth and depth of home services that span the entire homeownership experience from the move to ongoing maintenance. Not only are we able to help a consumer with the services they need at any point in their journey with their home, but also by going deeper into select services such as insurance, warranty, moving, and handyman services, we are able to improve the consumer experience and capture more value. This ability to create value from consumers allows Porch to offer a unique and strong value proposition to companies that provide access to their customers. Because we are able to drive value to the companies that use our products and services, we believe we are more easily able to attract new business partners, which then enables us to continue our investments in product development and customer support to ensure we sustain our competitive advantage.
Our Strategies for Growth
Porch Group’s strategy is to provide home service professionals with the tools they need to run a successful business, gain early access to homebuyers, and utilize proprietary data on homebuyers and their homes. We believe that this combination of products, services and data, and customer access can help Porch build fast-growing and healthy homeowners insurance and warranty businesses, and make homeownership simpler. Through this strategy, we anticipate 

11



growth in many areas: by selling software to more companies, by adding more software modules for companies, by getting access to more consumers at key moments in time, by selling more services to each consumer, and generating more revenue per service sold. Within insurance specifically, we are able to utilize the proprietary data across all platforms of software aiming to enhance revenue and effectiveness of risk management. We have and will continue to grow through geographic expansion, which efforts have expanded our homeowners insurance offerings from 6 to 21 states over the past 2 years. We intend to continue focusing on growth that will positively impact long-term shareholder value through the following strategies:
​
Sell More Software and Gain Access to More Homebuyers
Porch Group’s software not only generates B2B SaaS-like fees, but it also serves as a low-cost customer acquisition tool that drives growth through expanded homebuyer access. Porch Group intends to expand its B2B SaaS fees and homeowner access by:

● | Increasing the number of software customers organically through expanded sales and marketing efforts and inorganically through acquisitions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Upselling into these software customers additional modules for B2B SaaS fees.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continuing to develop long-term relationships with software customers, while increasing B2B SaaS fees as we helps these software customers grow their business.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing the percentage of software customers that grant access rights to their consumers. In some verticals, such as mortgage, this is a strategic benefit to our software customer as they are able to seamlessly provide insurance solutions to the borrower, who will be required to purchase insurance during the mortgage process. We believe this value-added service approach can increase a loan officer’s close rate, reduce time to close and improve the homebuying experience for the homebuyer. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Increase Revenue per Homebuyer
Porch Group intends to capitalize on its expanded homebuyer access by increasing the revenue generated from each homebuyer by:

● | Improving the digital shopping experience for consumers who prefer to shop for moving solutions, home maintenance providers, and insurance and warranty policies online.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing the percentage of individuals with access rights that are called, contacted, and engaged by the Company’s Moving Concierge call center team.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Making available additional high-margin services for these homebuyers, such as solar installation and increasing the market access for certain services only offered in select geographies, such as the Company’s insurance and home warranty solutions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing conversion and take rates of both existing and new services by offering more services, such as offering home warranty contracts in parallel with providing homeowner insurance quotes, to incentivize customers to not leave the Porch Group ecosystem.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Continued Expansion of Insurance and Warranty Offerings
EIG, a wholly owned subsidiary of Porch, is an insurance agency that is currently licensed in all 50 states. By acquiring Homeowners of America in 2021, Porch expanded from solely operating an insurance agency to pricing and underwriting its own homeowners insurance products. By doing so, Porch intends to capitalize on the underwriting advantage provided by its unique insights into properties and homebuyers. In addition, HOA cedes some insurance 

12



premiums, thus reducing earnings volatility and the capital required for the insurance carrier. Potential growth opportunities for Porch’s insurance business include expanding from the 21 states where it operates HOA, and adding more insurance carriers as partners. 
Porch collects proprietary data on households through the software platforms homeowners use to access handyman, inspection and other services. The insurance division uses this proprietary data to add efficiency in the underwriting and sales process, leading to increased revenue.
On September 9, 2021, Porch completed its acquisition of AHP, a Texas-based provider of whole home warranty policies across the U.S. AHP utilizes a direct-to-consumer model to acquire customers for their multi-year warranty plans.
On April 1, 2022, Porch acquired RWS, one of the key companies operating in the home inspection space, providing CRM software, recall check software, and specific inspection-centric warranties to more than 1,000 home inspection companies. The business also distributes full annual home warranty products through real estate agents across the country, which helps us move our warranty business and strategy forward.
Mover Marketing
Today, companies of all shapes and sizes advertise to movers through direct mail after the consumers have moved into their new home and change their address with the United States Postal Service. Through Porch Group’s early access to homebuyers, the Company helps homebuyers obtain earlier access to discounts and promotions that are typically made available to movers, through its leading consumer data and analytics platform.
Geographic Expansion
Porch Group currently conducts the vast majority of its business in the United States and a small portion in Canada. While the Company expects to remain focused on the U.S. market for the next several years, in the future Porch may expand internationally into Europe, Australia, and other markets where the home sales market operates similarly to the U.S. Within the United States, Porch operates nationwide and has opportunity to expand its insurance operations and offerings across more of the U.S. markets.
Revenue
Porch generates revenue in three ways: (i) insurance revenue in the form of insurance and warranty premiums, ceding commissions, policy fees, commissions from reinsurers and other insurance-related fees generated through its own insurance carriers, as well as commissions from third-party insurance carriers where Porch acts as an independent agent; (ii) predominantly recurring software and service subscription revenue generated from fees paid by companies for access to Porch’s software and provision of services, (iii) reoccurring B2B2C transaction revenues for move-related services through fees received for connecting homeowners to a variety of service providers during the time of move; and business-to-consumer (“B2C”) transaction revenues from post-move services in the form of fees earned from introducing homeowners to home service professionals, including handyman, plumbers, electricians, roofers, etc.
Insurance Segment
Homeowners insurance and home warranty, which form Porch Group’s Insurance segment, are our largest and fastest growing revenue streams. Where Porch underwrites its own insurance or warranty product, premiums are recognized over the life of the policy and reoccur at a high rate as the policyholder renews. In certain portions of business sold by EIG on behalf of third-party insurers, Porch recognizes the estimated lifetime value (“LTV”) of commissions Porch receives from insurance carriers for each new sale to a policyholder which are paid in the first year and each subsequent year that the policyholder renews. The vast majority of Porch’s insurance and warranty revenue is recurring revenue recognized annually as customers renew. A portion of the warranty contracts are a 3-year term, and those revenues are recognized over the term of the contract.

13



In 2022, revenue from our insurance and warranty offerings was $121.0 million or 44% of total revenue.
Vertical Software Segment
Most companies that use Porch’s software and services pay Porch monthly or annual fees on a combination of per user, per organization and/or volume of transactions. In addition, in certain verticals such as home inspection, companies may provide Porch with access and an introduction to the consumer; here Porch generates additional revenue via B2B2C transactions. Because of the volume and value of services needed when purchasing a home, getting access to consumers increases revenue per company.

For our move-related services, we generate B2B2C transaction revenue, which includes commissions and fees related to the sale of services such as moving services, security, or TV/Internet, as well as fees earned from providing services directly to homeowners. Revenue for B2B2C transactions, excluding Insurance and Warranty, generally follow the seasonality of both existing home sales and home projects, with more revenue concentrated in the second and third quarters rather than the first and fourth quarters.
Post-move revenue is generated by the Company connecting third-party service providers with homeowners that meet pre-defined criteria and who may be looking for relevant services. Transaction revenue for post-move services include monthly fees from contractors as well as per lead, per appointment and per job fees paid by contractors and partners to Porch when we provide customer demand.
In 2022, revenue from our software and subscription services was $72.8 million or 26% of total revenue, and revenue from move-related and post-move services, was $82.1 million or 30% of total revenue (majority being from move-related).
Sales and Marketing
We sell our software and services to companies using a variety of sales and marketing tactics. We have teams of inside sales representatives organized by vertical market who engaged directly with companies. We have enterprise sales teams that target the large named accounts in each of our vertical markets. In addition, our underwritten insurance business uses field teams to onboard and engage with independent agents in various states. These teams are supported by a variety of typical software marketing tactics, including both digital, in-person (such as trade shows and other events) and content marketing as well as tactics common in insurance like in person visits and targeted compensation. Porch Group has successfully partnered with key companies in our vertical markets who have aided in sales and adoption.
To reach consumers, Porch Group largely relies on our relationships with approximately 30,900 companies and small businesses to provide access and distribution. Porch Group then utilizes technology, lifecycle marketing and teams in lower-cost locations to operate as a Moving Concierge to assist these consumers with services. In addition, our underwritten insurance business gains access to consumers from third-party independent agents.
Technology
Porch Group has invested significantly for many years in engineering, product, and design to build out our platform. We operate a modern technology stack that allows for rapid development and deployment as well as integrations. Our platform allows us to build and develop consumer facing applications that integrate with many of our business units to acquire consumers and help those consumers with all the services they would need around the home. An example of this is the Porch smartphone app that brings consumers into our ecosystem and functions as a platform allowing our business units to integrate to offer capabilities.
Each of our business units develops its own technology to support its products and services, leveraging both open-source and vendor-supported software technology. Each of our various software brands and businesses has dedicated engineering teams responsible for software development and creating of new features to support our products and services across a full range of devices (desktop, mobile web and native mobile applications). Our engineering teams use an agile development process that allows us to deploy frequent iterative product and feature releases.

Competition
The home services industry is highly competitive, fragmented, and localized. We compete with, among others: (i) vertical software companies in our markets, (ii) companies who provide or help consumers purchase homeowners insurance, home warranty, moving, and other home services, (iii) search engines or online marketplaces for all types of home services with which we assist consumers, and (iv) other companies which help consumers to make managing and maintaining their homes simple. We believe that our largest competition comes from the wide variety of companies focused on reaching consumers to help with key high-value services such as insurance.
We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:

● | the size, quality, diversity and stability of the large number of companies utilizing Porch’s software and services who give Porch early and proprietary access to homebuyers and property data;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our ability to consistently generate revenues through our access to homebuyers and homeowners in a cost-effective manner;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our ability to price our homeowners insurance products more effectively than others;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our access to capital, including reinsurance arrangements;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | our ability to increasingly engage with consumers directly through our platforms (rather than through search engine marketing or search engine referrals);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the functionality of our software and services, websites and mobile applications and the attractiveness of their features and our products and services generally to home services companies and consumers, as well as our continued ability to introduce new products and services that resonate with consumers and service professionals generally;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our ability to continue to build trust in and loyalty to, our various brands, particularly American Home Protect, Elite Insurance Group, Floify, HireAHelper, Homeowners of America, Home Inspector Pro, iRoofing, ISN, Kandela, Palm-Tech, Porch.com, RWS, Rynoh, and Porch Group Media; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the ability for us to continue to expand our platform organically and inorganically into other vertical markets and select services.

The Company has several trademarks, trade names, trade secrets, service marks, domain names, and proprietary technologies and customer relationships that we believe, in the aggregate, constitute a valuable asset. However, we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on any individual, trademark or other intellectual property asset.
The Company seeks to protect its intellectual property rights through a combination of trademarks, trade dress, domain name registrations, and trade secrets, as well as through contractual restrictions and reliance on federal, state and common law. In addition, the Company enters into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with employees, consultants, contractors and business partners, and employees and contractors are also subject to invention assignment 
Government Regulation 
Porch Group is subject to laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet generally and through mobile applications, including laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for their operations and the activities of users. As a result, the Company could be subject to claims based on negligence, unfair business practices, various torts and trademark and copyright infringement, among other actions.

As Porch Group receives, transmits, stores and uses a substantial amount of information received from or generated by consumers and service professionals, the Company is impacted by state laws and regulations governing privacy, the storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal data and data breaches. These regulations are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state and local administrative agencies. For example, California passed a comprehensive data privacy law, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), and other states including Virginia, Colorado, Utah and Connecticut have also passed similar laws. These laws impose data protection obligations on covered businesses, including consumer rights procedures and obligations, limitations on data uses, audit requirements for higher risk data, and constraints on certain uses of sensitive data. The majority of the CPRA provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required.
We are subject to laws governing marketing and advertising activities conducted by/through telephone, e-mail, mobile devices and the Internet, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (“TCPA”), the Telemarketing Sales Rule (“TSR”), the CAN-SPAM Act, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and similar state laws, as well as federal, state, and local laws and agency guidelines governing background screening.
We are also subject to certain laws and regulations with regard to the real estate settlement process, including the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which, among other matters, prohibits certain practices, such as kickbacks, referrals, and unearned fees for the referral of real estate settlement services.
Furthermore, our moving services business is subject to various federal, state and local agencies that exercise broad regulatory powers over the moving industry, generally governing such activities as operations of and authorization to engage in transportation, insurance requirements, and licensing.
Additionally, as we expand into the insurance business, which is highly regulated, we must comply with and maintain various licenses and approvals with individual state departments of insurance, and we are subject to state governmental regulation and supervision.
State Regulation - Insurance
Our insurance business is subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the state level. The method, extent and substance of such regulation varies by state, but generally has its source in National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") model laws and regulations that establish standards and requirements for conducting the business of insurance and that delegate regulatory authority to a state regulatory agency.  Moreover, the NAIC Accreditation Program requires state regulatory agencies to meet baseline standards of solvency regulation, particularly with respect to regulation of multi-state insurers. In general, such regulation is intended for the protection of those who purchase or use our insurance products, and not our shareholders. These rules have a substantial effect on our business and relate to a wide variety of matters including: insurance company licensing and examination; the licensing of insurance agents and adjusters; price setting or premium rates; trade practices; approval of policy forms; claims practices; restrictions on transactions between our subsidiaries and their affiliates, including the payment of dividends; investments; underwriting standards; advertising and marketing practices; capital adequacy; and the collection, remittance and reporting of certain taxes, licenses and fees.
Insurance Holding Company Regulation - Insurance
Nearly all states have adopted the version of the Model Insurance Holding Company System Regulation Act and Regulation as amended by the NAIC in December 2010 (the "Amended Model Act"). As part of an insurance holding company system, Homeowners of America Insurance Company (HOAIC), our insurance business, is required to register with the Texas Department of Insurance (the insurance supervisory agency of HOAIC’s state of domicile) and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the

operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system. Under these laws, the respective state insurance departments may examine us at any time, require disclosure of material transactions and require prior notice of or approval for certain transactions. All transactions within a holding company system affecting an insurer must have fair and reasonable terms and are subject to other standards and requirements established by law and regulation.
Financial Solvency Ratios - Insurance
The NAIC annually calculates 13 financial ratios to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies. A "usual range" of results for each of these ratios is used by insurance regulators as a benchmark. Departure from the usual range on four or more of the ratios could lead to inquiries from individual state insurance departments as to certain aspects of a company's business. In addition to the financial ratios, states also require us to calculate a minimum capital requirement for each of our insurance companies based on individual company insurance risk factors. These "risk-based capital" results are used by state insurance regulators to identify companies that require regulatory attention or the initiation of regulatory action. 
Restrictions on Shareholder Dividends - Insurance
Our insurance carrier’s capacity to pay dividends to shareholders is limited. Insurance companies must provide advance informational notice to the domicile state insurance regulatory authority prior to payment of any dividend or distribution to its shareholders. Prior approval from the state insurance regulatory authority must be obtained before payment of an "extraordinary dividend" as defined under the state's insurance code. The amount of ordinary dividends that may be paid is subject to certain limitations, the amounts of which change each year.
Price Regulation - Insurance
Nearly all states have insurance laws requiring our carrier to file rate schedules, policy or coverage forms, and other information with the state's regulatory authority. In certain states, rate schedules, policy forms, or both, must be approved prior to use. While insurance laws vary from state to state, their objectives are generally the same: an insurance rate cannot be excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory. The speed with which we can change our rates in response to competition or in response to increasing costs depends, in part, on the willingness of state regulators to allow adequate rates for the business we write.
Insurance Reserves - Insurance
State insurance laws require that insurance companies analyze the adequacy of their reserves annually. Our appointed actuaries must submit an opinion that our statutory reserves are adequate to meet policy claims-paying obligations and related expenses.
Exiting Geographic Markets; Canceling and Non-Renewing Policies - Insurance
Most states regulate our carrier’s ability to exit a market. For example, states limit, to varying degrees, our ability to cancel and non-renew insurance policies. Some states prohibit us from withdrawing one or more types of insurance business from the state, except upon prior regulatory approval. Regulations that limit policy cancellation and non-renewal may restrict our ability to exit unprofitable markets.
Investment Regulation - Insurance
Our insurance business is subject to various state regulations requiring investment portfolio diversification and limiting the concentration of investments we may maintain in certain asset categories. Failure to comply with these regulations leads to the treatment of nonconforming investments as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus. Further, in some instances, state regulations require us to sell certain nonconforming investments.

Insurance Guaranty Associations – Insurance
Each state has insurance guaranty association laws. Membership in a state's insurance guaranty association is generally mandatory for insurers wishing to do business in that state. Under these laws, associations may assess their members for certain obligations that insolvent insurance companies have incurred with regard to their policyholders and claimants.
Typically, states assess each solvent association member with an amount related to that member's proportionate share of business written by all association members within the state. Most state guaranty associations allow solvent insurers to recoup the assessments they are charged through future rate increases, surcharges or premium tax credits. However, there is no assurance that we will ultimately recover these assessments. We cannot predict the amount and timing of any future assessments or refunds under these laws.
Shared Market and Joint Underwriting Plans - Insurance
State insurance regulations often require insurers to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations. These are mechanisms that generally provide applicants with various types of basic insurance coverage that may not otherwise be available to them through voluntary markets. Such mechanisms are most commonly instituted for automobile and workers' compensation insurance, but many states also mandate participation in Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plans or Windstorm Plans, which provide basic property coverage. Participation is based upon the amount of a company's voluntary market share in a particular state for the classes of insurance involved. Policies written through these mechanisms may require different underwriting standards and may pose greater risk than those written through our voluntary application process.
Statutory Accounting Principles - Insurance
For public reporting, insurance companies prepare financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). However, state laws require us to calculate and report certain data according to statutory accounting rules as defined in the NAIC Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual. While not a substitute for any GAAP measure of performance, statutory data frequently is used by industry analysts and other recognized reporting sources to facilitate comparisons of the performance of insurance companies.
Federal Regulation - Insurance
Although the federal government and its regulatory agencies generally do not directly regulate the business of insurance, federal initiatives and legislation often have an impact on our business. These initiatives and legislation include tort reform proposals, proposals addressing natural catastrophe exposures, terrorism risk mechanisms, federal financial services reforms, various tax proposals affecting insurance companies, and possible regulatory limitations, impositions and restrictions arising from the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank").
