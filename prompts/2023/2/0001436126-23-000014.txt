•Industrial
•Power Generation and Transmission
•Infrastructure, Research and Engineering
•Other Process Industries
•Petrochemical
A majority of our revenues are generated by deploying technicians at our customers' locations. Most of our revenues from aerospace and defense as well as certain manufacturing customers are generated by performing inspections and testing at our various in-house laboratories.
We generated revenues of $687.4 million, $677.1 million and $592.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We generated net income of $6.6 million, a net income of $3.9 million and net loss of $99.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we generated approximately 83%, 82% and 80%, respectively, of our revenues from our Services segment. Our revenues are diversified, with our top ten customers accounting for approximately 33%, 33% and 32% of our revenues during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, with no customer accounting for greater than 10% of our revenues in any such year.
OUR SPECIALIZED SOLUTIONS
As a OneSource provider of asset protection solutions, we combine our industry-leading services, products, data management solutions and technologies to provide a unique, custom-tailored solution for each customer’s individual asset protection needs, ranging from routine inspections to complex, plant-wide asset integrity management.
Field Inspections
Our field inspections portfolio includes traditional and advanced NDT techniques, along with predictive maintenance assessments of fixed and rotating assets and inline inspection for pipelines. We offer these solutions on an individual basis, or as parts of enterprise inspection and testing programs.
NDT is the examination of an asset without materially impacting its integrity. The ability to inspect infrastructure assets and not interfere with their operating performance makes NDT a highly-attractive alternative to many traditional techniques, which may require shutting down an asset or entire facility. Typical issues for which our technicians inspect include corrosion, cracking, leaking, faults and flaws in piping, storage tanks and pressure vessels, as well as a wide range of other industrial assets and public infrastructure. 
Our automated data acquisition solutions utilize smart sensing and monitoring, robotic inspection systems, and digitized spot inspections to provide asset integrity data with greater insight into current and future asset conditions.
Table of Contents

Field inspection services lend themselves to integration with our other offerings, and as such have often served as the initial entry point to more advanced customer engagements that require additional solutions. After an initial field inspection is performed, we are able to provide multiple supplemental solutions that further serve to solidify our relationships with our customers and drive additional revenue.
Data Solutions
The asset protection solutions that we provide throughout our customers’ asset lifecycles generate asset integrity data that needs to be effectively archived, managed, and analyzed. A common difficulty that our customers face is the ability to easily access and analyze data from multiple data collection and input contractors. We recognize that this data is most valuable to our customers when it is accessible and integrated (regardless of vendor, tool, or facility), and have taken significant steps to digitalizing asset protection processes through the release of the first-ever asset protection software ecosystem MISTRAS OneSuite. 
The OneSuite software platform offers functions of our popular software and services brands as integrated apps on a cloud environment. OneSuite serves as a single access portal for customers' data activities and provides access to 90 plus integrated applications being offered on one centralized platform. 
Plant Condition Management Software (PCMS®). Our world-class enterprise inspection database management software ("IDMS") - Plant Condition Management Software ("PCMS") - was developed specifically for process industries and equipment, and enables the storage, organization and analysis of inspection data. 
PCMS offers wide-ranging support for mechanical integrity programs, including:
•Comprehensive inspection tracking, scheduling and analysis
•Corrosion analysis and trending
•Integrated risk-based inspection ("RBI") calculators
•Safety relief valve management
PCMS compares data to prior operations, similar assets, industrial standards and specific risk conditions, such as use with highly-flammable or corrosive materials. It also develops asset integrity management plans based on RBI calculations that specify an optimal schedule for the testing, maintenance and retirement of assets.
In many instances, customers of our field inspections and consulting services also have licensed PCMS for storage and analysis of collected inspection and Mechanical Integrity ("MI") data.
We believe PCMS is one of the most widely used plant condition management software systems in North American refineries. We estimate it is currently used by approximately 50% of the U.S. refiners, as well as by leading midstream pipeline energy companies and major energy companies in Canada and Europe. This provides us with recurring maintenance and support fees and marketing opportunities for additional software and solutions.
Pipeline Data. Following our acquisitions of companies such as Onstream and New Century Software, that support the midstream sector of the oil and gas industry, we believe we provide among the most comprehensive, data-driven pipeline protection solutions available to the industry. These proprietary pipeline data analysis solutions enable deep integration of inline inspection ("ILI") big data with real-time risk analytics and business intelligence ("BI") to provide capabilities for supporting pipeline integrity, which we believe provides us with an important competitive advantage.
MISTRAS Digital®. We have also invested resources in digitalizing and optimizing the collection, transfer, and visibility of field inspection data. MISTRAS Digital is an electronic platform that digitally delivers field inspection assignments and related data, captures inspection results, and delivers electronic reporting and productivity tracking via relevant key performance indicators ("KPIs") to multiple members of a customer organization, including those not directly associated with the inspection function. Customers have made clear that the timely and accurate delivery of field data to their "IDMS" is an important feature for them. MISTRAS Digital integrates with PCMS and other inspection data management systems to provide additional productivity improvements.
Monitoring
Table of Contents

Online Monitoring. Our online condition-monitoring solutions provide real-time reports and analysis of infrastructure to alert facility personnel to damages before critical failures occur, while our flexible, IIoT-compatible, cloud-based online monitoring portal centralizes and analyzes all collected monitoring data.

Maintenance
We perform maintenance and light mechanical services to prepare assets for inspection and to return them to working condition post inspection. These services include corrosion removal, mitigation and prevention; insulation installation and removal; electrical services; heat tracing, industrial cleaning; pipefitting; and welding. Our light mechanical services are often offered as complementary, value-added solutions to inspections, such as removing insulation in order to inspect piping, then re-installing insulation.
Our multi-disciplined technicians offer maintenance and light mechanical services in hard-to-access areas, in combination with rope access or diving strategies.
Mechanical services are still a small part of our business, and we carefully try to avoid providing any such services that conflict with our inspection services.
Engineering Consulting
We provide a broad range of engineering consulting services, primarily for process equipment, technologies and facilities. Our engineering consultations include plant operations and management support, turnaround/shutdown planning, profit improvement, facilities planning studies, engineering design, process safety reviews, energy optimization evaluations, benchmarking/key performance indicator development and technical training.
Our Asset Integrity Management ("AIMS") and MI services help improve asset reliability and regulatory compliance through a systematic, engineering-based approach to ensure the ongoing integrity and safety of equipment and industrial facilities. AIMS/MI services can include conducting an inventory of infrastructure assets; developing, implementing and training personnel in executing inspection and maintenance procedures; and managing MI programs. We help to identify gaps between existing and desired practices and establish quality assurance standards for fabrication, engineering and installation of infrastructure assets.
Access
Much of our work is conducted in hard-to-access locations, including those in at-height, subsea and confined locations. We utilize scaffolding and rope access to access at-height and confined assets; certified divers for subsea inspection and maintenance; and unmanned (drone) aerial, land-based and subsea systems to deliver a wide range of inspection applications, with an emphasis on minimizing at-height access and confined space entry.
Equipment
We design and manufacture portable, handheld, wireless and turnkey NDT equipment, along with corresponding data acquisition sensors and software, for spot inspections and long-term, unattended monitoring applications.
We sell these solutions as individual components, or as complete systems, which include a combination of sensors, amplifiers, signal processing electronics, knowledge-based software and decision and feedback electronics. We also sell integrated service-and-system technology packages, in which our field technicians utilize our proprietary and specialized testing procedures and hardware, advanced pattern recognition, neural network software and databases to compare test results against our prior testing data or industry standards.
We provide a range of acoustic emission ("AE") products and are a leader in the design and manufacture of AE sensors, instruments and turnkey systems used for monitoring and testing materials, pressure components, processes, and structures. We also design and manufacture ultrasonic testing ("UT") equipment.
Most of our hardware products are fabricated, assembled and tested in our ISO-9001-certified facility in Princeton Junction, New Jersey. We also design and manufacture automated ultrasonic systems and scanners in France.

ASSET PROTECTION INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
Asset protection plays a crucial role in assuring the integrity and reliability of critical infrastructure. As an asset protection solutions provider, we seek to maximize the uptime and safety of critical infrastructure, by helping customers to detect, locate, mitigate, and prevent damages such as corrosion, cracks, leaks, manufacturing flaws and other concerns to operating and structural integrity. In addition to these core utilities, the storage and analysis of collected inspection and MI data is also a key aspect of asset protection.
NDT has historically been a prominent solution in the asset protection industry due to its capacity to detect defects without compromising the integrity of the tested materials or equipment. Traditionally, the supply of NDT inspection services has been provided by many relatively small vendors, who provide services in a more localized geographic region. A trend has emerged, however, for customers to increasingly engage a select few vendors capable of providing a wider spectrum of asset protection solutions for global infrastructure, in addition to an increased demand for advanced non-destructive testing ("ANDT") solutions and data acquisition software, both of which require a highly-trained workforce.
Due to these trends, those vendors offering integrated solutions, scalable operations, skilled personnel and a global footprint are expected to have a distinct competitive advantage. Moreover, we believe that vendors that are able to effectively deliver both advanced solutions and data analytics, by virtue of their access to customers’ data, create a significant barrier to entry for competitors, leading to the opportunity to further create significant recurring revenues.
Key Dynamics of the Asset Protection Industry
We believe the following represent key dynamics of the asset protection industry, and that the market available to us will continue to grow as these macro-market trends continue to develop:
Extending the Useful Life of Aging Infrastructure While Increasing Utilization. Due to the prohibitive costs and challenges of building new infrastructure, many companies have chosen to extend the useful life of existing assets through enhancements, rather than replacing these assets. This has resulted in the significant aging and increased utilization of existing infrastructure in our target markets. Demand for refined petroleum products, combined with high plant-utilization rates, drives refineries to upgrade facilities to make them more efficient and expand capacities. Because aging infrastructure requires more frequent inspection and maintenance in comparison to new infrastructure, companies and public authorities continue to spend on asset protection to ensure their aging infrastructure assets continue to operate effectively.
Outsourcing of Non-Core Activities and Technical Resource Constraints. Due to the increasing sophistication and automation of NDT programs, a decreasing supply of skilled professionals and increasing governmental regulations, companies are increasingly outsourcing NDT to third-party providers with advanced solution portfolios, engineering expertise and trained workforces.
Table of Contents

Digital Transformation of Asset Protection. Plants in the oil and gas and process industries are recognizing the need to evolve their traditional, paper-based mechanical integrity programs in favor of digitalized solutions. The rise of big data intelligence and the need to gain actionable insights from raw asset integrity data are growing trends that provide opportunities for contractors with a wide range of asset protection expertise and integrated data platforms to help customers maximize uptime while controlling costs.
Increasing Corrosion from Low-Quality Inputs. The increased availability and low cost of crude oil from areas such as shale plays and oil sands resources have led to the use of lower-grade raw materials and feedstock. This leads to higher rates of corrosion, especially in refining processes involving petroleum with higher sulfur content, which increases the need for asset protection solutions to detect and/or proactively prevent corrosion-related issues.
Increasing Use of Advanced Materials. Customers in various target markets - particularly aerospace and defense - are increasingly utilizing advanced materials, such as composites and other unique technologies in their assets. These materials often cannot be tested using traditional NDT techniques. We believe that demand for more advanced testing and assessment solutions will increase as the utilization of these advanced materials increases during the design, manufacturing, operating and quality control phases. 
Meeting Safety Regulations. Owners and operators of refineries, pipelines and petrochemical and chemical plants increasingly face strict government regulations and more stringent process safety enforcement standards. This includes the continued implementation of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s National Emphasis Program. Failure to meet these standards can result in significant financial liabilities, increased scrutiny by government and industry regulators, higher insurance premiums and tarnished corporate brand value. As a result, these owners and operators are seeking highly-reliable asset protection suppliers with a track record of assisting organizations in meeting increasingly stringent regulations. Our customers benefit from our extensive engineering consulting base that supports them in devising mechanical integrity programs that both meet regulatory compliance standards and enable enhanced safety and uptime at the customer's facilities.
Expanding Addressable End-Markets. The continued emergence of and advances in asset protection technologies and software-based systems are increasing the demand for asset protection solutions in applications where existing techniques were previously ineffective. This has been true for the wind energy market, which has been receptive to updating traditional blade inspection processes in favor of unattended, remote monitoring solutions such as Sensoria.
Expanding Aerospace and Defense Industry. We believe that increased demand will continue to come over the next several years from the commercial industry due to the approximately decade-long backlog for next-generation commercial aircraft to be built, driving the need for advanced solutions that drive cost and quality efficiencies. Demand continues to be stable in the defense industry while demand in the outerspace industry is growing. 
Crude Oil Prices. Volatility in the energy sector has been profound during the 2015-2022 period. The collapse of world oil prices in 2015 and 2016 undermined industry expansion. While energy prices recovered in 2017 and 2018, they once more declined, and subsequently rebounded in the second half of 2021 and the first half of 2022 with near record high prices and crack spreads. This resulted in refineries delaying turnarounds during 2022 until oil prices decreased and stabilized in the second half of 2022. The on-going war in Ukraine, coupled with macroeconomic uncertainty in 2023, are expected to continue to significantly impact oil prices for the foreseeable future. 
Expanding Pipeline Integrity Regulations: The United States Pipeline & Hazardous Materials Safety Administration’s “Mega Rule” adopted in October 2019, expands pipeline integrity regulations on more than 500,000 miles of pipelines that carry natural gas, oil and other hazardous materials throughout the United States. Some of these requirements will take operators decades to fulfill. These regulations require inspection and integrity data records throughout a pipeline’s lifetime to be “reliable, traceable, verifiable, and complete,” increasing the demand for integrated inspection, engineering, monitoring, and data management and analysis solutions.
Consolidation of Refineries: Consolidation of refinery ownership will create both pressure on refinery service providers due to increased customer purchasing power and provide an opportunity to those same refinery service providers to become preferred providers to these larger customers. 
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths contribute to our being a leading provider of asset protection solutions and will allow us to further capitalize on growth opportunities in our industry:
OneSource Provider for Asset Protection Solutions. We believe we have one of the most comprehensive portfolios of integrated asset protection solutions worldwide, which positions us to be a leading single-source provider for our customers’ asset

protection requirements. This is particularly a competitive strength in regards to turnarounds and shutdowns - during which facilities temporarily cease portions of their operations in order to perform plant-wide inspections, maintenance and repairs - as the services being requested and performed during these work stoppages make up significant portions of refinery, process and power plant maintenance budgets. Demand for our solutions increases during these outages, as facilities seek third-party providers to perform a wide spectrum of asset protection operations while the plant is offline. In addition, as companies are increasingly outsourcing their NDT needs to third-party providers, we believe that the ability to offer a comprehensive package of solutions provides us with a competitive advantage.
Integrated Data Management: Our expertise and proprietary research and development in data solutions throughout the asset protection cycle provides a competitive advantage. With solutions for integrated data acquisition, storage, visualization and analytics, our integrated data solutions well-position us for the oil and gas increasing movement towards digitalizing and centralizing asset protection to fewer, highly-skilled and multi-disciplined vendors. Many of our data solutions are platform-agnostic, allowing us to integrate into customers' existing operations, and thereby expanding the potential customer pool for our solutions. Our presence in our customers’ operations throughout their asset lifecycles also ideally positions us to be their primary vendor to centralize their asset integrity data collection, management and analysis, creating mutually-beneficial opportunities to scale our relationships.

Our Growth Strategy
Our growth strategy emphasizes the following key elements:
Continue to Digitalize Asset Protection Data and Processes. We place a data-centric focus on asset protection, enabling our customers to ease some of their biggest areas of concern (particularly the timely and accurate transfer of asset integrity data from the field to their IDMS, as well as the data’s visibility and accessibility once uploaded). We expect that the demand for big data intelligence and remote data visibility will continue to grow, and are investing in data solutions that help our customers visualize and generate actionable insight from their asset integrity data, regardless of data input. We are also actively seeking to optimize our customers’ asset protection workflows and processes, by creating digital paths between data applications to increase data visibility and reduce manual data entry and human error.
We have continued providing our customers with innovative asset protection software ecosystem through our MISTRAS OneSuite platform. The software platform offers functions of our popular software and services brands as integrated apps on a cloud environment. OneSuite serves as a single access portal for customers' data activities and provides access to 90 plus integrated applications being offered on one centralized platform. 
Expand Our Focus in the Aerospace and Defense Industries. We believe that the introduction of next-generation airframes and aircraft engines has created an inherent demand for inspection, testing, machining and mechanical services required for the production of parts. The recent interest in the use of additive manufacturing techniques to create components also necessitates advanced inspection and testing solutions. We consummated two acquisitions of aerospace inspection companies in 2017, enhancing our capabilities and focus on providing solutions to our customers in the aerospace and defense industries throughout their manufacturing value chains in this growing area.
Expand Our Focus in the Pipeline Integrity Industry. We intend to continue broadening our solutions for the pipeline market. Recent industry regulations significantly expanded pipeline integrity management regulations, requiring pipeline owner/operators to inspect, document, and assess the risk of operating conditions for existing lines. This provides us with the opportunity to provide asset protection solutions for both the new construction and integrity phases. In 2019, we acquired a company that provides pipeline integrity management software and services to energy transportation companies. We acquired an inline inspection provider in 2018 and have implemented our PCMS software for several pipeline operators to support their integrity data management.
Expanding our Mechanical Services Portfolio. We believe that performing mechanical services to complement inspections, such as removing and reapplying insulation or preparing surfaces for coating or painting, is an important market differentiator for us. This is particularly true, for example, when considering the cost-efficiencies our customers realize when our rope access technicians perform these services at height without the use of scaffolding. Many of our customers already require these services, but utilize multiple vendors to do so, creating an opportunity for us to provide greater value to a customer base that increasingly requires enhanced speed and efficiency.
Continue to Develop Technology-Enabled and Digital Asset Protection Solutions. We intend to maintain and enhance our technological leadership by continuing to invest in developing new technology, applications and data services. The release of our OneSuite ecosystem underscores our dedication to continue deepening synergies between our solutions to provide our customers with uniquely-integrated offerings, which we believe makes us a more attractive vendor for customers seeking to centralize their asset protection. We have actively continued to develop technologies that enhance the flow of data throughout multiple operational phases and facilities, through solutions such as MISTRAS Digital, our integrated pipeline integrity data portfolio, and our cloud-based monitoring data portal, and Sensoria, our wind blade monitoring technology.
Expand our Solution Offerings to Existing Customers. We believe that branching into adjacent, complementary services, such as mechanical services, increases our value proposition and our ability to capture additional business. Many of our customers are multinational corporations with asset protection requirements at multiple locations. We believe that expanding our solution offerings and merging and visualizing data across facilities for enterprise data analysis, combined with the trend of customers outsourcing asset protection to service providers with integrated offerings, provides opportunities for significant additional recurring revenues.
Continue to Expand Our Customer Base into New End Markets. We believe we have significant opportunities to expand our customer base in relatively new end markets, including wind and other alternative energy, natural gas transportation industries pipeline integrity and additive manufacturing. We believe that the development of our Sensoria tool, which allows our customers to maximize uptime, performance and safety of wind turbine blades, provides additional growth and expansion of our capabilities to serve both new and existing wind turbines and greatly enhances our product offerings within the renewable energy industry. The expansion of our addressable markets is being driven by the increased recognition and adoption of advanced asset protection technologies that are supplanting traditional methods.

Our Target Markets

Overview

We operate in a highly competitive, but fragmented market. Domestically, the market is serviced by several national competitors and many regional and/or local companies. Internationally, our primary competitors are divisions of large companies, with additional competition from small independent local companies which may be limited to a specific product, service or technology and focused on a niche market or geographic region. We focus our strategic sales, marketing and product development efforts on a range of infrastructure-intensive based industries and governmental authorities. We view energy-related infrastructure and commercial aerospace as our largest market opportunities. We perform inspection and mechanical services for customers in both industries.
There are a number of economic factors which drive the aerospace market, including:
•The multi-year backlog for next generation commercial aircraft to be built, including several large and mid-sized aircraft built by Boeing and Airbus, among other manufacturers; and
•The continuing regulatory scrutiny to ensure public safety serves to ensure the continued need for inspection and mechanical services to be performed.

In the energy market, there are various economic indicators that drive our business, especially in the U.S. domestic markets. It is unclear what the short and long term effects of the war between Russia and Ukraine is likely to have on the world economy and certain of our target markets, including particularly the oil and gas market. Excerpted below are forecasts from various Energy Information Administration (EIA) outlook reports, which are subject to change based on these factors:
Electricity generation from coal is projected to fall throughout the mid 2020's and the decrease will be partially offset by an increase in the forecast of combined utility-scale solar and wind generation. 
Table of Contents

The EIA noted U.S. crude oil production averaged 11.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2021 and rose to an average 11.9 million bpd in 2022. The EIA forecasts production to continue to increase to an average 12.4 million bpd in 2023 and further increase to 12.8 million bpd in 2024. 
Revenue by Target Market

The following charts represent our revenue by target market for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. The petrochemical market was previously consolidated within the oil and gas target market for the year ended December 31, 2020. We have separately broken out this information beginning with the year ended December 31, 2020, as we have continued to provide services and products to this market, and continue to expect increases in future periods. For comparability purposes, Petrochemical comprised 3% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was included within the oil and gas target market previously.

Oil and Gas
We supply oil and gas asset protection solutions to downstream (refining), midstream (transportation and storage) and upstream (exploration and production) operations.
We use our vast solutions portfolio to help identify current and future asset performance, and actively prevent, mitigate or otherwise address potential issues, including corrosion, cracking, leaking and other damages that may lead to safety, productivity or environmental concerns. Our solutions help identify conditions that if not remedied, could lead to potential catastrophic failures in tanks, vessels, valves, buried and above ground pipelines, pumps, motors, compressors and other critical assets found throughout the oil and gas production and delivery supply chain. 
We actively seek to evolve our solutions through technological enhancements and research and development to discover new applications. Online monitoring and permanently-mounted sensors, as well as the use of drones and other alternative delivery devices, are all being considered as oil and gas infrastructure owners look to “smart” technologies that reduce human intervention while delivering highly-accurate inspection and integrity data. We also have actively sought to further enhance our integrated approach to asset protection, through the development of our complementary mechanical service portfolio.
In general, the oil and gas market is poised to leverage digital solutions to facilitate process improvements as well as increase plant reliability and improve process and personnel safety. This provides an opportunity for us to synergistically leverage our digital asset protection solutions, including MISTRAS Digital and OneSuite. Digital transmission of data in various industry sectors, with built-in analytic functions, will allow our customers to better leverage inspection data that is being generated in the field.
While we expect off-stream inspection of critical assets to remain a routine practice, we anticipate an increase in the demand for non-invasive or on-stream inspections. Non-invasive inspections enable companies to minimize the costs associated with shutting down equipment during testing, while enabling the economic and safety advantages of advanced planning and/or predictive maintenance.

Aerospace and Defense
The aerospace industry continued to rebound from COVID-19 throughout 2022 with backlog and production levels approaching and exceeding pre-pandemic levels for certain OEMs for the first time since the pandemic. We serve this rapidly-growing target market by providing a full range of inspection, testing, machining, mechanical, finishing, additive manufacturing and equipment solutions, for which we are Nadcap certified. Our state-of-the-art in-house labratories maintain numerous accreditations from industry organizations, including Nadcap, and some of the largest manufacturers in the world, such as Boeing, Safran, Airbus, Bombardier and Embraer.
Advanced composite materials found in new classes of aircraft require advanced asset protection solutions, including x-ray of critical engine components, ultrasonic fatigue testing of complete aircraft structures and corrosion detection and other critical components. Many OEMs are shifting towards condition-based maintenance utilizing embedded monitoring sensors to track component structural and operational integrity over time as opposed to performing maintenance on time-based intervals. We expect demand for our solutions to increase with the adoption of these new-age materials and distributed online sensor networks. We also expect demand for asset protection solutions to increase with the continued adoption of additive manufacturing techniques. 
Industrials
The quality control requirements driven by the need for zero-to-low-defect component tolerance within automated, robotic-intensive industries such as automotive, consumer electronics and medical industries serve as key drivers for increased demand in asset protection, particularly for in-house inspection and testing. We expect that increasingly stringent quality-control requirements and competitive forces will drive the demand for more-costly finishing and polishing which, in turn, creates opportunities for integrated partnerships between us and our customers throughout the production lifecycle.
Power Generation and Transmission
We provide asset protection solutions for customers in the combined cycle, fossil, nuclear, transmission and distribution and wind/alternative energy industries. We believe that in recent years, acceptance of asset protection solutions has grown in this industry due to the aging of critical power generation and transmission infrastructure.
During the fourth quarter of 2021, we received a U.S. patent for the technology behind Sensoria, our innovative 24/7/365 rotor blade monitoring system and sensors that enable blade integrity management for wind turbine owners and operators. Sensoria is a remote rotor blade monitor that detects and reports damages in real-time, including cracks, lightning strikes, skin ruptures and perforations, delaminations, and more. By sending immediate damage alerts to operators, Sensoria enables them to maximize blade uptime and generating capacity while preventing damages from worsening. This tool provides additional growth and expansion of our capabilities to serve both new and existing wind turbines and greatly enhances our product offerings within the renewable energy industry.
The growing availability of cheap natural gas, along with environmental concerns with coal, has stimulated the construction of new natural gas-fired power plants across North America, creating opportunities for us to provide specialized solutions in multiple phases. These include facility design consultations, NDT services during construction and plant operations and long-term condition monitoring. We anticipate sharp growth in these types of plants as natural gas pricing remains low, and the environmental impacts of coal remain unattractive to the public. 
We also offer solutions for inspection, maintenance, monitoring and data services for wind turbines and their components. These include NDT services — often performed through rope and/or drone access — to identify corrosion, cracking, and other defects that can affect the safety and operational effectiveness of wind turbines, along with remedial solutions to repair minor damages identified during inspections.
Other Process Industries
Our asset protection solutions are crucial for process industries, or industries in which raw materials are treated or prepared in a series of stages, including chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food processing, pulp and paper and metals and mining. As the process facilities are increasingly facing aging infrastructure, high utilization, growing capacity constraints and increasing capital costs, we believe asset protection solutions will continue to grow in importance in maintenance planning, quality and cost control and prevention of catastrophic failure.
Infrastructure, Research and Engineering
We believe that high-profile infrastructure catastrophes have caused public authorities to more actively seek ways to prevent similar events from occurring. Public authorities tasked with new construction and maintenance of existing public infrastructure 
Table of Contents

increasingly use asset protection solutions to inspect these assets, including the use of embedded sensors to enable online monitoring throughout the life of the asset.
We have provided testing and structural health monitoring and data solutions on bridges and structures worldwide, including some of the largest and most well-known bridges in the United States and United Kingdom. Our sensors continuously monitor these assets, alerting owner/operators when defects are detected. Our monitoring teams also provide regular reports that include early warnings of suspect areas before an alarm is generated.
Petrochemical
We provide asset protection NDT services for customers within the petrochemical industry, as they transform byproducts into goods which are utilized in many end products such as plastics, soaps, fertilizers, synthetic fibers and rubber. Our solutions help identify conditions that if not remedied, could lead to potential catastrophic failures in tanks, vessels, valves, buried and above ground pipelines, pumps, motors, compressors and other critical assets found throughout the petrochemical production process. 
We actively seek to evolve our solutions through technological enhancements and R&D to discover new applications. Online monitoring and permanently-mounted sensors provide real-time data to petrochemical owners and operators and provide an opportunity for us to synergistically leverage our asset protection solutions into our MISTRAS Digital platform, OneSuite. Digital transmission of data in various industry sectors, with built-in analytic functions, will allow our customers to better leverage inspection data that is being generated in the field. We also have actively sought to further enhance our integrated approach to asset protection, through the development of our complementary mechanical service portfolio.
Customers

We provide our asset protection solutions to a global customer base of diverse companies primarily in our target markets. No customer represented 10% or more of our revenue in any of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020.
Geographic Areas
We have operations in 10 countries and occasionally conduct business in a few other countries. Most of our revenues are derived from our U.S., Canadian and European operations and we do not have operations in Russia, and we do not do business in Russia, Ukraine or other areas which are impacted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. See Note 2-Revenue and Note 19-Segment Disclosure to our audited consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report for further disclosure of our revenues, long-lived assets and other financial information regarding our international operations.
Sales and Marketing

We sell our asset protection solutions through our direct sales and marketing activities worldwide. In addition, our project and laboratory managers, as well as our management, are trained on our solutions and often are the source of sales leads and customer contacts. Our direct sales and marketing teams work closely with our customers to demonstrate the benefits and capabilities of our asset protection solutions, refine our asset protection solutions based on changing market and customer needs and identify potential opportunities. We divide our sales and marketing efforts into services sales, products and systems sales and marketing and utilize marketing automation and customer relationship management ("CRM") systems to collect, manage and collaborate customer information with our teams globally. Our CRM systems also provide critical data to provide accurate forecasting and reporting. 
Manufacturing

Most of our hardware products are manufactured in our Princeton Junction, New Jersey facility. This facility includes the capabilities and personnel to fully produce all of our AE products and NDT Automation Ultrasonic equipment. We also design and manufacture automated ultrasonic systems and scanners in France.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 5,400 employees worldwide, of which 3,600 were located in the United States, 600 in Canada and 1,200 in our other non-U.S. locations. As described below, we value our employees and have established various programs to promote the satisfaction, health and safety of our employees. Less than 0.01% of our employees in the United States are unionized.
Table of Contents

Our employees are key to achieving our goals and strategy. We have committed resources throughout our organization to ensure that we are attracting, developing, and retaining talented employees needed to support all aspects of our activities. Our core values and business ethics guide and direct all activities undertaken by us.
The health and safety of our employees is paramount. We have also developed key initiatives and strategies regarding our talent and people initiatives. Below, we describe some of the key initiatives and values around health and safety. Management regularly updates our Board of Directors with regards to our safety and people strategy and how we are performing in these areas. In 2020, our Board established the Environmental, Social and Safety Committee. This Committee, which consists of independent directors, monitors and oversees the strategic direction of our initiatives in support of our core values and our environmental, social and governance initiatives.
Talent, Leadership and Employee Development
Employee development and engagement begins with our senior management team, which has considerable industry experience and expertise. Leveraging this experience and expertise, our senior management team is able to continuously review our organizational structure and provide opportunities for the growth and development for our employees. This process helps us develop leaders at all levels within the organization, and to engage employees with rewarding opportunities, competitive salary and benefits, to advance their careers and contribute to our success. 
As part of our continued commitment to our employees, we have established various programs to promote lifelong learning and development opportunities for our employees. These include a mix of voluntary and mandatory training programs, which are provided in-person, virtually or on the job. We also provide employees the ability to continue to gain additional professional certifications to contribute to their career advancement. We utilize a web-based training center which is available to field technicians for career advancement and includes over 500 web-based classes. In addition, we are committed to ensuring all employees are compensated at a living wage. All local minimum wage requirements are met and where no wage laws are in place, employees are compensated competitively, in accordance with industry standards.
We also provide leadership development using third-party leadership organizations to members of our executive management team, and we make available coaching and leadership development to all levels of management, including our General Managers who work in the field. Our human rights policy places a high priority on diversity and equal opportunity and provides our employees with management’s expectations related to human rights and labor practices. 
Another program we instituted focuses on our connection by a common thread of caring – about one another, our customers, the environment, and the work we do. We seek to foster a culture of togetherness, safety, respect, and contribution which enables each individual member to feel that he or she is a part of something bigger. A community of caring professionals with a genuine passion for helping people and making a difference together – that is the heart of the program we call “Caring Connects.”
Our Safety-Conscious Culture
We consider safety the backbone of our operations. Our asset protection solutions aim to ensure that industrial assets and facilities remain in safe, reliable working condition, which in turn enhances safety for our clients, the public, and the environment. Our labratory and field personnel are trained to operate according to strict safety and quality standards so that our processes and procedures regarding hazardous materials, worker safety, and accident prevention are sound and effective. Further to this, we are constantly evaluating these processes and procedures to ensure that they remain of high quality and are effective, and consider changes in the manner in which work is performed or lessons that have been learned from any sources, such as industry data. We work to help ensure that our clients are in full compliance with all federal, state, and local regulations. Our practices, policies and procedures are designed to help ensure we perform our duties through the use of safe, industry-best practices, seeking to minimize risk wherever possible. 
We emphasize a “MISTRAS’ safety-conscious” culture with the intent that it becomes embedded in the day-to-day work of all our employees. We use various training tools and other practices to instill attitudes, beliefs, perceptions, and values that all employees share in the mandate to create and maintain a safe work environment for all. 
We continuously monitor our safety performance through analysis of our company-wide safety statistics, which help us to determine behavioral trends while also instilling a culture of proactivity. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our Total Recordable Incident Rate was 0.41 while Days Away, Restricted and Transferred Rate was 0.15 and Lost Work Day Rate 
Table of Contents

remained at historical lows of 0.03. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our Total Recordable Incident Rate (“TRIR”) was 0.15, when excluding COVID-19 related cases. 
Seasonality

Our business is seasonal. This seasonality relates primarily to our oil and gas target market, and to a lesser extent within our other target markets. U.S. refineries’ non-peak periods are generally in the fall, when they are retooling to produce more heating oil for winter, and in the spring, when they are retooling to produce more gasoline for summer. The peak periods for these customers are the summer and winter months, when they run at peak capacity and are not retooling or performing turnarounds or shut downs. As a result, our revenues in the summer and winter months are typically lower than our revenues in the fall and spring, when demand for our asset protection solutions from the oil and gas as well as the fossil and nuclear power industries increases during their non-peak production periods. Because we are increasing our work in the fall and spring, our cash flows are lower in those quarters than in the summer and winter, as collections of receivables lag behind revenues. We expect that this seasonality will continue.
Competition

We operate in a highly competitive, but fragmented, market. Our primary competitors are divisions of large companies and various small companies which generally are limited to a specific product or technology and focused on a niche market or geographic region. We believe that few, if any, of our competitors currently provide the full range of asset protection and NDT products, enterprise software ("PCMS") and the traditional and advanced services solutions that we offer. Our competition with respect to NDT services include Acuren, SGS Group, the Team Qualspec division of Team, Inc. and APPLUS RTD. Our competition with respect to our PCMS software includes UltraPIPE, Lloyd’s Register Capstone, Inc. and Meridium Systems. In the traditional NDT market, we believe the principal competitive factors include project management, availability of qualified personnel, execution, price, reputation and quality, whereas in the advanced NDT market, reputation, quality and size tend to be the most significant competitive factors. We believe that the NDT market has significant barriers to entry which would make it difficult for new competitors to enter the market. These barriers include: (i) having to acquire or develop advanced NDT services, products and systems technologies, which in our case occurred over many years of customer engagements and at significant internal research and development expense, (ii) complex regulations and safety codes that require significant industry experience, (iii) license requirements and evolved quality and safety programs, (iv) costly and time-consuming certification processes, (v) capital requirements and (vi) emphasis by large customers on size and critical mass, length of relationship and past service record.
Research and Development 
Our research and development is principally conducted by engineers and scientists at our Princeton Junction, New Jersey headquarters, and supplemented by other employees in the United States and throughout the world, including France, Greece the United Kingdom, Brazil and the Netherlands. Our total professional staff includes employees who hold Ph.D.’s and engineers and employees who hold Level III certification, the highest level of certification from the American Society of Non-Destructive Testing (ASNT).
We make strategic research and development investments in technologies that support integration with our other solution offerings to enhance cost- and time-efficiencies, maximize uptime and safety and improve the flow of data from field technicians to inspection databases. We have invested, and continue to invest, resources in the development of MISTRAS Digital, an electronic platform that digitally delivers field inspection assignments and related data, capture inspection results, and provide electronic reporting and productivity tracking. We have also invested significant research and development in pre-machining and advanced testing technologies in a purpose-built facility for an aerospace customer, with the goal of reducing the customer’s production cycle logistics and costs.
We also work with customers to develop new products or applications for our technology, including:
•Testing of new composites
•Detecting crack propagation
•Wireless and communications technologies
•Development of permanently embedded inspection systems to provide continuous, online, in-service monitoring of critical structural components
Table of Contents

Research and development expenses are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) as research and engineering expenses. Our company-sponsored research and engineering expenses were approximately $2.0 million, $2.5 million and $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. While we have historically funded most of our research and development expenditures, from time to time we also receive customer-sponsored research and development funding. Most of the projects are in our target markets, however, a few of the projects could lead to other future market opportunities.

Many elements of our asset protection solutions involve proprietary know-how, technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications because they are not patentable or would be difficult to enforce, including technical processes, algorithms and procedures. We believe that this proprietary know-how, technology and data is the most important component of our intellectual property used in our asset protection solutions and is a primary differentiator of our solutions from those of our competitors. We rely on various trade secret protection techniques and agreements with our customers, service providers and vendors to protect these assets. All of our employees are subject to confidentiality requirements through our employee handbook. In addition, many of our employees have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us. Our employee handbook and these agreements require our employees not to use or disclose our confidential information and to assign to us all the inventions, designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us, as well as addressing other intellectual property protection issues. We also seek confidentiality agreements from our customers and business partners before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our technologies or business strategies. We are not currently involved in any material intellectual property claims.
