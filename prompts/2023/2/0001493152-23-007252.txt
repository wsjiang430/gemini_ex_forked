Overview
 
We are a biopharmaceutical company using our proprietary Precision Timed ReleaseTM (PTRTM) drug delivery platform technology to build and advance a pipeline of next-generation pharmaceutical products designed to improve the lives of patients suffering from frequently diagnosed conditions characterized by burdensome daily dosing regimens and suboptimal treatment outcomes. With an initial focus on the treatment of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), we are identifying and evaluating additional therapeutic areas where our PTR technology may be employed to develop future product candidates, such as anxiety disorders. Our PTR platform incorporates a proprietary Erosion Barrier Layer (EBL) designed to allow for the release of drug substance at specific, pre-defined time intervals, unlocking the potential for once-daily, multi-dose tablets.
 
We are targeting the ADHD stimulant-based treatment market, with an estimated US market size of $18 billion as of the September 2022. Stimulants are the most commonly prescribed class of medications for ADHD and account for more than 90% of all ADHD medication prescriptions in the United States, where approximately 80 million stimulant prescriptions were written during the 12-months ended September 2022. By contrast, non-stimulant medications are typically employed only in the second-line or adjunctive therapy setting and account for 10% of all ADHD medication prescriptions. Extended-release, or long-acting, dosage forms of stimulant medications are most frequently deployed as the first-line treatment for ADHD and constitute approximately 59% of ADHD stimulant prescriptions by volume and nearly 83% of the dollars. Most of these extended-release dosage forms are approved for once-daily dosing in the morning and were designed to eliminate the need for re-dosing during the day. However, with the current ‘once-daily’ extended-release dosage forms, most patients still receive a second or “booster” dose for administration later in the day (typically in the early afternoon) to achieve entire active-day coverage and suffer from a multitude of unwanted side effects as a result. We believe there is a significant, unmet need within the current treatment paradigm for true once-daily ADHD stimulant medications with lasting duration and superior side effect profiles to better serve the needs of patients throughout their entire active-day.
 
Our two proprietary, first-line stimulant medications: CTx-1301 (dexmethylphenidate) and CTx-1302 (dextroamphetamine), are being developed for the treatment of ADHD in the three main patient segments: children (ages 6 -12), adolescents (ages 13-17), and adults (ages18+). Both CTx-1301 and CTx-1302 are designed to address the key shortcomings of currently approved stimulant therapies by: providing an immediate onset of action (within 30 minutes); offering ‘entire active-day’ duration; eliminating the need for a ‘booster/recovery’ dose of short-acting stimulant medications; minimizing or eliminating the rebound/crash symptoms associated with early medication ‘wear-off;’ and providing favorable tolerability with a controlled descent of drug blood levels. Furthermore, by eliminating the ‘booster’ dose used by up to 60% of ADHD patients in conjunction with their primary medication, we believe our product candidates will provide important societal and economic benefits: reducing the abuse and diversion associated with short-acting stimulant medications; allowing physicians to prescribe one medication versus two; allowing patients to pay for one medication versus two; and allowing payers to reimburse one medication versus two.
 
We completed a proof-of-concept trial in human subjects to validate our PTR platform and in October 2020, announced positive results from a Phase 1/2 study of CTx-1301 in ADHD patients establishing tolerability, comparative bioavailability, and dose proportionality of CTx-1301 versus Focalin® XR. In order to meet the pharmacology requirement for the CTx-1301 New Drug Application (NDA) submission, we completed a food effect study in October 2022, which demonstrated that CTx-1301 can be taken with or without food. A Phase 3 adult dose-optimization study to assess the efficacy and safety, along with onset and duration, of CTx-1301 in adults with ADHD was initiated in December 2022, dose optimization of the first cohort has commenced and results are expected in the third quarter of 2023. We plan to initiate the CTx-1301 Phase 3 fixed-dose pediatric and adolescent safety and efficacy study in mid-2023 with results expected in the first quarter of 2024. Assuming we receive positive clinical results from our pivotal Phase 3 trial for CTx-1301, we plan to submit an NDA for CTx-1301 under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in the first half of 2024 with potential FDA approval in the first half of 2025. If we receive FDA approval for CTx-1301, we may conduct Phase 4 trials. In addition, we plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 bioavailability study in ADHD patients for CTx-1302 in mid-2024 and, if the results from this study are successful, subsequently initiate pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials for CTx-1302 in late 2024 or early 2025.

We believe that our PTR platform has the potential to provide patients and physicians with differentiated pharmaceutical treatment options that will enhance patient compliance and improve health outcomes in several additional therapeutic areas. We intend to leverage our PTR platform technology to expand and augment our clinical-stage pipeline by identifying and developing additional assets in other therapeutic areas where one or more or more active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) need to be delivered several times a day at specific, pre-defined time intervals and released in a manner that would offer significant improvement over existing therapies. Our criteria for the selection of additional, future pipeline candidates will include the potential for $1 billion or more in peak annual sales, the potential to deliver a clearly differentiated therapeutic advantage and the potential to overcome unmet medical needs.
 
We are constructing a clinical program for CTx-2103 (buspirone), our anxiety candidate, under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which may result in a faster time to NDA submission. As part of that effort:
 
We presented results from the human formulation study of CTx-2103 in September 2022 at the annual Psych Congress. Pharmacokinetics were evaluated for this trimodal tablet providing three precisely timed doses of buspirone versus one immediate release dose. In addition, scintigraphic imaging visualized transit of the tablets through the gastrointestinal tract to confirm both the site and onset of release, which will then be correlated with pharmacokinetic data to establish the full release profile of the CTx-2103 formulation.
 
Based on the pharmacokinetic profile seen in the data, CTx-2103 achieved the desired triple release of buspirone. These positive results provided the critical information required to allow us to request a Pre-IND meeting with the FDA to discuss the design of our clinical and regulatory program for CTx-2103, which we expect to occur in the third quarter of 2023 to allow for a potential IND filing in the fourth quarter of 2023. Furthermore, we may seek breakthrough therapy designation due to its potential ability to improve efficacy and outcomes and the potential to reduce the use of benzodiazepines. In 2020, United States sales for this API accounted for over $2 billion of sales in the $5.2 billion anxiety market. CTx-2103 will be designed as a once-daily, multi-dose tablet with clear differentiation and compelling advantages over standard treatment options.

Our Strategy
 
Our goal is to be a leading, innovative biopharmaceutical company focused on the development, manufacturing and commercialization of next generation pharmaceutical products that utilize our PTR drug delivery platform technology to create dosing schedules and drug release profiles that will improve the lives of patients suffering from a multitude of frequently diagnosed conditions. Key initial elements of our business strategy to achieve this goal are to:

● | Complete development and obtain regulatory approval for CTx-1301 for the treatment of ADHD. In October 2020, we announced positive results from a Phase 1/2 bioavailability study in ADHD patients for CTx-1301. We initiated a Phase 3 adult dose-optimization study for CTx-1301 in December 2022, dose optimization of the first cohort has commenced and results are expected in the third quarter of 2023. We plan to initiate a Phase 3 fixed-dose pediatric and adolescent safety and efficacy study in mid-2023 with results expected in the first quarter of 2024. Assuming we receive positive clinical results from our Phase 3 trials, we plan to submit an NDA for CTx-1301 in the first half of 2024 under the Section 505(b)(2) pathway with potential FDA approval in the first half of 2025. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Successfully commercialize CTx-1301. If we receive FDA approval for our CTx-1301, we plan to commercialize our lead candidate with the assistance of Indegene, Inc. In March 2023, we entered into to a Joint Commercialization Agreement with Indegene pursuant to which Indegene will provide commercialization services for CTx-1301, including marketing, sales, market access and distribution, on a fee for service basis. 
● | Advance clinical trials for CTx-2103 for the treatment of anxiety. In September 2022, we announced that data from the human formulation study for CTx-2103 demonstrated the ability to deliver a single administration of triple-release buspirone. We will use these results to design the clinical program for CTx-2103, which will be designed as a once-daily, multi-dose tablet with what we believe will be clear differentiation and compelling advantages over standard treatment options. 
● | Advance development of CTx-1302 for the treatment of ADHD. We plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 bioavailability study in ADHD patients for CTx-1302 in the mid-2024 and, if the results from this study are successful, subsequently initiate pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials in all patient segments for CTx-1302 in late 2024 or early 2025. 
● | Maximize the potential of our PTR platform to develop additional product candidates in new indications with significant unmet medical need and billion-dollar revenue potential. We intend to use our PTR drug delivery platform technology and the streamlined 505(b)(2) development pathway to develop additional therapeutic assets in other therapeutic areas where one or more active pharmaceutical ingredients need to be administered several times a day at specific, pre-defined time intervals and released in a manner that would offer significant improvement over existing therapies. We believe this will lead to improved patient compliance and better health outcomes. Further indications we intend to evaluate include insomnia, non-opioid pain, Alzheimer’s, hypothyroidism, psychosis, depression, cardiovascular disorders, Parkinson’s disease, migraine, oral oncology, xerostomia (dry mouth) and bipolar disorder, among others. 


● | Acquire or in-license additional assets or programs complement our portfolio or leverage our technology. We continuously evaluate potential partnering opportunities or asset acquisitions that can bolster our current product candidate portfolio and provide substantial value to our organization. We intend to focus on early to mid-stage development product candidates to generate clinical data and potentially move to later stages of development and ultimately on to commercialization. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Out-license our PTR platform to other companies and license our product candidates outside of the United States. We evaluate opportunities to license our PTR drug delivery platform technology to other companies looking to transform multiple daily dosing to once daily administration to satisfy patient needs. We also evaluate opportunities to license our product candidates to third parties for use outside of the United States. 
● | Further strengthen our intellectual property portfolio. We intend to continue to manage and expand our diverse intellectual property portfolio and maintain our trade secrets and know-how focused on our PTR platform, current and future pipeline candidates, and proprietary manufacturing process. We believe these activities will be critical to protect our platform and product candidates from potential competitors that may try to compete with our therapeutic assets and compression tableting approach. 
● | Capitalize on our existing cGMP expertise. We have developed a proprietary, reliable, high output, specialized manufacturing equipment with the potential for real-time testing and release that is employed by our third-party manufacturing partner. Our process has been designed to allow for the creation of a platform that can incorporate other drug substances thus permitting expansion into additional indications and therapeutic areas. We expect that our investment in these manufacturing capabilities and equipment will substantially reduce our development timelines and overall development costs for current and future assets. We currently utilize commercial manufacturing equipment and will not require technology transfer or large scale-up processes to meet clinical or commercial manufacturing needs. In October 2022, we announced that we have selected Societal CDMO, Inc. (Societal) as our new contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) that will manufacture all clinical, registration, and commercial batches of our lead candidate CTx-1301. Societal will dedicate a specific manufacturing suite within its Gainesville, GA facility and outfit it with proprietary equipment supplied by us.

ADHD Overview and Drawbacks of Current Therapies
 
ADHD is a chronic neurobehavioral and developmental disorder that affects millions of children, adolescents and adults. In the United States, approximately 6.4 million, or 11%, of children and adolescents aged 4-17 have been diagnosed with ADHD. Among this group, 80% receive treatment and 65% demonstrate clinical ADHD symptoms that persist into adulthood. Adult ADHD prevalence in the United States is estimated at approximately 11 million patients, or 4.4%, of the population, almost double the size of the child and adolescent segment combined. Currently, approximately 20% of the adult ADHD population receives treatment, however an increasing number of adult patients are being diagnosed and seeking treatment causing the adult ADHD market to grow approximately 10% year over year. Total ADHD medication sales in the United States continue to grow with sales of all ADHD medications reaching approximately $22.1 billion for the 12-months ended September 30, 2022.
 
ADHD is marked by an on-going pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning and/or development. According to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, common manifestations of ADHD in children and adolescents include:
 
Hyperactivity: Children always seem to be in motion. A child who is hyperactive may move around touching or playing with whatever is around, or talk continually. During story time or school lessons, the child might squirm around, fidget, or get up and move around the room. Some children wiggle their feet or tap their fingers. A teenager or adult who is hyperactive may feel restless and need to stay busy all the time.

Impulsivity: Children often blurt out comments without thinking first. They may often display their emotions without restraint. They may also fail to consider the consequences of their actions. Such children may find it hard to wait in line or take turns. Impulsive teenagers and adults tend to make choices that have a small immediate payoff rather than working toward larger delayed rewards.
 
Inattentiveness: Inattentive children may quickly get bored with an activity if it’s not something they really enjoy. Organizing and completing a task or learning something new is difficult for them. As students, they often forget to write down a school assignment or bring a book home. Completing homework can be huge challenge. At any age, an inattentive person may often be easily distracted, make careless mistakes, forget things, have trouble following instructions, or skip from one activity to another without finishing anything
 
Adult ADHD patients typically suffer from restlessness, impulsivity, difficulty with time management, trouble regulating emotions and difficulty managing finances. Adults with ADHD report experiencing an internal sense of fidgetiness and restlessness and experience greater difficulty communicating with others. Upon entering the job market, many adults have difficulty gaining employment and are at increased risk of termination due to repeated tardiness or absenteeism. Adults with ADHD earn approximately 30% less and are 10% less likely to be employed versus their unaffected peers. Additionally, adults with ADHD are more likely to exhibit a variety of comorbidities including drug and alcohol abuse, social anxiety and depression.
 
ADHD in both children and adults has an impact not only on the individual but on their families, friends and peers and because of its prevalence as one of the most commonly diagnosed behavioral disorders, a critical impact on society, the healthcare system and the economy at large. On a societal level, versus control groups, ADHD patients experience a greater than 40% higher rate of vehicle accidents, 2x greater divorce rate, have a 2-fold greater incidence of accidental death, and research from prospective studies indicates that children and adults with ADHD have approximately twice the incarceration rate. On an economic level, in the United States alone, national annual incremental cost of ADHD ranged from $143 billion to $266 billion.
 
Although there is no single medical, physical, or genetic test for ADHD, qualified mental health care professionals and physicians are able to provide a diagnostic evaluation after gathering information from multiple sources including ADHD symptom checklists, standardized behavior rating scales, detailed histories of past and current functioning, and information obtained from close family members or significant others. Some practitioners will also conduct tests of cognitive ability and academic achievement in order to rule out a possible learning disability.
 
Stimulants are the most commonly prescribed class of medications for ADHD, accounting for more than 90% of all ADHD medication prescriptions. Stimulants are Schedule II controlled substances and are believed to work by enhancing the effects of dopamine and norepinephrine neurotransmitters in the brain. Approximately 80 million stimulant prescriptions were written during the 12-months ended September 2022. In contrast, non-stimulant medications are typically deployed as second line or adjunctive therapies and account for 10% of all ADHD medication prescriptions. Currently, the ADHD market is dominated by four main stimulant medications: Vyvanse®, Adderall® XR, Concerta®, and Focalin® XR. These products were approved and became available between 2000 and 2007 and were believed to revolutionize the ADHD treatment paradigm by finally providing a solution to avoid the late morning second dose of stimulant medication then required by ADHD patients.

Unfortunately, as designed, all four of the mostly commonly prescribed stimulant drugs deliver all the drug substance during the morning hours. As a result, most patients still require additional medication to cover the remainder of their active day. Currently, 60% of ADHD patients require an afternoon ‘booster/recovery’ dose due to lack of duration, slow onset of efficacy, and the crash or rebound effects in the early afternoon. Additionally, their PK-PD release profiles are such that they leave patients significantly impaired by crash and rebound effects even while on therapy.
 
Patients and practitioners report, that an ideal ADHD stimulant medication would provide all of the following characteristics: entire active-day duration (14-16 hours); immediate onset of action (within 30 minutes); ability to minimize or avoid crash / rebound effects associated with rapid decline in medication blood levels; and elimination of the need for short-acting stimulant booster/recovery doses.

In recent years, the FDA has approved additional stimulant medications that were designed to meet some of the remaining unmet needs. Chewables, liquids and oral disintegrating tablets have come to market as has one product with an evening dosing schedule intended to provide early morning onset. None of these products have been able to meet all of the unmet needs of ADHD patients and prescribers and consequently all have failed to gain traction as first-line agents. Furthermore, these recent stimulant medications, based on their market share, appear to offer little advantage over widely available generic products for healthcare practitioners and their patients. They have proven to be niche remedies occupying a combined 2.0% of the total ADHD prescriptions written in the United States in 2020. Thus, there is an unmet need for a true once-daily dose providing a fast onset of action, minimization or elimination of the crash/rebound, elimination of the booster/recovery dose, and most importantly, providing entire active-day efficacy.

Our Solution: Our Proprietary Precision Timed Release Drug Delivery Platform Technology
 
We are developing medications capable of achieving true once-daily dosing using our internally developed PTR drug delivery platform technology. Our CTx-1301, CTx-1302 and CTx-2103 drug candidates contain three releases of active pharmaceutical ingredient combined into one small tablet dosage form (smaller than many comparable single dose ADHD products). Each release of API is separated with a proprietary EBL, a functional excipient that is designed to gradually erode throughout the day to provide controlled drug release at specific time intervals, allowing for a target efficacious period of up to 16 hours.

We believe our PTR technology affords our drug candidates the following advantages over currently available ADHD treatments:
 
Fast Onset. Many currently available therapies often take up to 60 minutes or longer to start working and thus can leave patients with long gaps between dosing and onset. In an effort to minimize this onset gap, patients will often wake up early to take their medication and attempt to go back to sleep until the medication takes effect. We have designed our drug candidates to be fast-acting so they can be taken in the morning when the patient starts their day, not predawn while they wait for onset.
 
Elimination of Need For Short-Acting Stimulant Boosters. With entire active-day coverage up to a 16-hour period, we believe our technology will eliminate the need for patients to take afternoon booster doses when their currently prescribed therapies wear off. By eliminating the need for a booster dose, we believe our candidates will cause less embarrassment for patients, especially child and adolescent patients who are often forced to take a second dose while at school surrounded by classmates and increase patient compliance especially in the ADHD population where patients are prone to forget to take the additional dose they need to get through their active day.
 
Lower Abuse Potential. We believe our fast onset and entire active-day solution for ADHD patients, if approved, will lower the incidence of short-acting stimulant drug abuse and diversion. We believe by eliminating the need for the short-acting stimulant booster dose, the potential for illicit sales and recreational use that often comes as a result of patients carrying short-acting Schedule II controlled substances to school or work for afternoon dosing will decrease.
 
Elimination Crash and Rebound Symptoms. Patients on currently available therapies may report adverse effects or a flare of ADHD symptoms as their medications wear off; these effects are termed “crash” and “rebound.” Using our precise timing, ratio, and style of drug delivery, we believe our candidates provide a controlled descent of blood levels, eliminating this uncomfortable experience for patients.
 
Lower Cost. By providing entire active-day efficacy, our drug candidates eliminate the need for doctors to prescribe more than one medication lowering the overall cost of the condition to individual patients and within the healthcare system at large. Furthermore, generic medications in the stimulant ADHD category are not tremendously less expensive as they are in other categories of non-controlled medications. Generic stimulant medications cost anywhere from 55%-90% of the cost of their brand counterparts. We believe, if approved, our drug candidates will offer a much more cost-effective solution to patients.

Significantly Improved Tolerability. Because of the PK and PD profile of our drug, we believe patients will experience fewer treatment related adverse events associated with existing stimulant therapies including insomnia, appetite suppression, and feelings of extreme restlessness, dysphoria, irritability, fatigue, and flattening of affect.
 
Availability in Eight Dosage Strengths at Launch and Single-Enantiomer API Selection. Our CTx-1301 and CTx-1302 product candidates are both round film-coated tablets that we intend to provide in eight matching dosage strengths. We believe providing practitioners with the ability to properly titrate and optimize their patients’ daily dosing needs is critical. By having eight dosage strengths at launch, practitioners will not have to constantly switch their patients to other medications or supplement patients with more short-acting booster medications. Medications that have launched with three dosage strengths are often ignored or avoided until at least six or seven strengths are available. Both CTx-1301 and CTx-1302 contain APIs that are Schedule II controlled substances. The APIs of both product candidates utilize just one of the multiple enantiomers, which may result in improvements in potency, adverse events (Aes), and drug interactions profiles along with an enhanced therapeutic index.
 
Our Lead Candidate CTx-1301: Dexmethylphenidate for the Treatment of ADHD in 6 Years and Older
 
We believe our most advanced drug product candidate, CTx-1301, will be the first true once-daily dexmethylphenidate tablet for the treatment of ADHD, providing onset-of-action within 30 minutes and efficacy for the entire active day (14 to 16 hours versus placebo). CTx-1301 is a trimodal extended-release tablet, based on tablet-in-tablet technology, which provides three releases of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride at precise times, ratio, and modality of release. Our CTx-1301 release profile is as follows:
 
Release #1: An initial immediate-release, or IR, dose providing 35% of the total daily dose beginning within five to six minutes after administration and designed to achieve therapeutic efficacy within 30 minutes; and
 
Release #2: Three hours after the administration of the dosage form, the first delayed, sustained release (DR1) provides 45% of the total daily dose released over 90 minutes; and
 
Release #3: Seven hours after the administration of the dosage form, a second delayed, immediate release (DR2, the built-in-booster) provides 20% of the total daily dose released over approximately 30 minutes.

Our proprietary, trimodal release profile is engineered to provide patients with a rapid onset of relief from symptoms and to maintain that relief throughout the entire active day. Further, we believe CTx-1301 will demonstrate a more favorable tolerability profile that results from this specialized design and unique 35%-45%-20% release profile, compared to the currently available 33%-33%-33% release profile that would be produced if a patient were to take three individual doses of dexmethylphenidate in the same milligram strengths. CTx-1301 delivers a release profile that cannot be replicated with commercially available short and long-acting formulations and was precisely engineered and designed to meet the specific needs of ADHD patients and providers.
 
We expect CTx-1301 film-coated tablets to be available in eight dosage strengths ranging from 6.25mg to 50mg of dexmethylphenidate. All excipients are compendial and/or non-novel, well established for use in oral formulations, and are present in the drug product at levels well below their maximum potencies listed in FDA’s inactive ingredient database (IID).
 
Our CTx-1301 Clinical Development Program
 
The proposed clinical program for CTx-1301 consists of two Phase 1/2 clinical pharmacology studies and our Phase 3 Mastery clinical efficacy and safety trials.
 
Our Phase 1/2 Bioavailability Trial Results
 
In October 2020, we announced positive results from a Phase 1/2 comparative bioavailability study in ADHD subjects, under fasted conditions, and demonstrated similar bioavailability to our Reference Listed Drug (RLD), Focalin XR. Adjusted geometric mean ratios of primary exposure parameters (Cmax, AUC0-inf, and AUClast) between CTx-1301 and Focalin XR were within the required 80% to 125% range, both at the high and the low doses, demonstrating a bridge to the RLD as well as dose proportionality. There were no unexpected adverse events, no serious adverse events, no deaths, and no other safety signals observed during this study.

● | A Phase 1, open-label, randomized, single-dose, two-period, two-treatment (fed vs fasted), two-sequence, crossover study in 23 healthy adult subjects, 18-50 years of age, to assess the effect of food on the absorption and bioavailability of CTx-1301. The objectives of this study were to assess the effect of food on the rate and extent of absorption and the overall bioavailability of a single dose of CTx-1301. Secondary objectives were to provide pharmacokinetic data on blood plasma levels of CTx-1301 in both a fasted and fed state, and to evaluate the safety of a single dose of CTx-1301 25 mg tablet. Exploratory objectives were to further explore the characteristics of CTx-1301 25 mg tablet within selected time intervals.

Our Planned Phase 3 MASTERY Trials
 
We initiated a Phase 3 adult dose-optimization study in December 2022, dose optimization of the first cohort has commenced and results are expected in the third quarter of 2023. We plan to initiate a Phase 3 fixed-dose pediatric and adolescent safety and efficacy study in mid-2023 with results expected in the first quarter of 2024. Assuming we receive positive clinical results from our Phase 3 trials, we expect to file an NDA for CTx-1301 in the first half of 2024 with potential FDA approval in the first half of 2025. Our entire Phase 3 clinical plan will include approximately 330 patients. Based on the results of our Phase 1/2 clinical trial and communications with the FDA, we expect the 505(b)(2) NDA filing for CTx-1301 will use Focalin XR as a reference drug, using as a basis for approval that drug’s efficacy and safety data on file at FDA, together with bioavailability/bioequivalence data and efficacy/safety data from our CTx-1301 clinical program.
 
The Phase 3 CTx-1301 safety and efficacy studies will utilize diagnostic tools and ADHD evaluations including the ADHD-RS-5, the CGI-S, and the PERM-P. These tools and evaluations are commonly used as study endpoints in support of an NDA filing.
 

● | The ADHD-RS, or ADHD Rating Scale is an 18-item scale based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) (American Psychiatric Association 2013) which evaluates the criteria of ADHD and rates symptoms on a 4-point scale. Each item is scored using a combination of severity and frequency ratings from zero (reflecting no symptoms or a frequency of never or rarely) to three (reflecting severe symptoms or a frequency of very often), so that the total ADHD-RS-5 scores range from zero to 54. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The CGI-S is the Clinical Global Impressions (Severity) Scale, a single-item scale that measures the severity of psychopathology from 1-7. 


● | The PERM-P, or Permanent Product Measure of Performance, is a skill-adjusted math test. The PERM-P score is the sum of the number of math problems attempted plus the number of math problems answered correctly in a 10-minute session. The scores range from 0-800 with higher scores indicating better performance. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our Phase 3 CTx-1301 clinical safety and efficacy studies include:
 

● | A Phase 3, dose-optimized, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center, parallel-group efficacy and safety laboratory classroom study in adults with ADHD. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of CTx-1301 compared to placebo in treating adults with ADHD in a laboratory classroom study using the PERM-P. Secondary objectives are to determine onset and duration of clinical effect of CTx-1301 and to determine safety and tolerability of CTx-1301 compared to placebo. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | A Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, fixed-dose, parallel-group, efficacy and safety study in children and adolescent (6-17 y/o) with ADHD. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of a fixed dose of CTx-1301 compared to placebo using the ADHD-RS-5. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of a fixed dose of CTx-1301 compared to placebo using the CGI-S, safety and tolerability of a fixed dose of CTx-1301, and PK levels after a single dose and at steady state. 
 | Exploratory objectives will be evaluated in the adult dose-optimization study to define and evaluate the unique benefits and satisfaction of optimized treatment with CTx-1301 against prior therapies using patient reported outcomes (PROs). The PRO evaluation will include: 


● | Subjects required use of “booster” doses for entire active-day efficacy, avoidance of wear-off effect, crash/rebound, and abuse/diversion of short-acting stimulants. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Compare overall treatment satisfaction of prior therapies versus CTx-1301. 
● | Compare adverse events of prior therapies versus CTx-1301. 
● | Evaluate importance of a true, once-daily treatment for ADHD. 
● | Evaluate the incidence of abuse and/or diversion of short-acting booster doses. 
● | Evaluate important differentiators for patients requiring ADHD treatment by providing a complete solution with entire active-day efficacy, fast onset of action, avoiding crash/rebound, and eliminating the required short-acting stimulant booster/recovery dose.

These exploratory measures will not only provide critical information for clinicians but also provide important data to payers and market access teams.
 
CTx-1302: Dextroamphetamine for the treatment of ADHD in 6 years and older
 
We believe our drug product candidate CTx-1302, will be the first true once-daily dextroamphetamine tablet for the treatment of ADHD, providing onset-of-action within 30 minutes and efficacy for the entire active day, up to 16 hours. CTx-1302 is a trimodal extended-release tablet, based on tablet-in-tablet technology, that provides three releases of dextroamphetamine at precise times, ratio, and modality of release. Our CTx-1302 release profile is as follows:
 

● | Release #1: An initial immediate-release, or IR, dose providing 45% of the total daily dose begins within five to six minutes after administration is designed to achieve therapeutic efficacy within 30 minutes; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Release #2: Three hours after the administration of the dosage from, the DR1 provides 35% of the total daily dose released over 90 minutes; and 
● | Release #3: Seven hours after the administration of the dosage form, a DR2, the built-in-booster provides 20% of the total daily dose released over approximately 30 minutes. 

 
We expect CTx-1302 tablets will be available in eight dosage strengths ranging from 6.25mg to 50mg of dextroamphetamine. All excipients are compendial and/or non-novel, well established for use in oral formulations, and are present in the drug product at levels well below their maximum potencies listed in FDA’s IID.
 
Our CTx-1302 Clinical Development Program
 
Our proposed clinical program for CTx-1302 consists of Phase 1 clinical pharmacology studies and Phase 3 clinical efficacy and safety trials. We plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 bioavailability study in ADHD patients for CTx-1302 in mid-2024 and, if the results from this study are successful, subsequently initiate pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials, the branded ACCOMPLISH trials, in late 2024 or early 2025. Our Phase 1 trials are expected to include approximately 100 patients and the Phase 3 clinical plan will include approximately 500 patients.
Our Planned Phase 1 Trials
 
Our proposed Phase 1 CTx-1302 clinical pharmacology studies include:
 

● | Phase 1/2 Comparative Bioavailability Study: To evaluate and compare the pharmacokinetic profile of CTx-1302 to the RLD, Dexedrine Spansule in adults with ADHD (18+ y/o). 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase 1 Food Effect Study: To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of CTx-1302 under fed and fasted conditions in adults (18+ y/o). 
● | Phase 1 Single-Dose, Fully-Replicate Crossover Study: To evaluate the intra-subject variability of the in vivo pharmacokinetic profile of CTx-1302 to the RLD, Dexedrine Spansule in adults (18+ y/o).

--

 

The Proposed Phase 3 CTx-1302 safety and efficacy studies will utilize diagnostic tools and ADHD evaluations including the ADHD-RS-5, the CGI-S, and the PERM-P. These tools and evaluations are commonly used and described above.
 
Our Planned Phase 3 ACCOMPLISH Trials
 

● | A Phase 3, fixed-dose, parallel-design, placebo-controlled, 5-week study in children and adolescent patients (6-17 y/o). The primary efficacy endpoint is the ADHD-RS-5. The Clinical Global Improvement Severity Scale (CGI-S) will be evaluated as a secondary endpoint. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | A Phase 3, analog workplace efficacy and safety study in adults (18+): The primary efficacy endpoint is the PERM-P. Time to onset and duration of effect will also be evaluated as key secondary endpoints. 
● | A long-term dose-optimization safety study will evaluate safety of the pediatric population (6-17 y/o) for six months. This study will collect and monitor any adverse events that occur during the timeframe of the study. 

 
Important exploratory endpoints included in the analog Phase 3 protocols will define and evaluate the unique benefits and satisfaction of optimized treatment with CTx-1302 against prior therapies using patient reported outcomes (PRO) similar to those from the CTx-1301 Phase 3 plan.
 
We expect the 505(b)(2) NDA filing for CTx-1302 will use Dexedrine® Spansule® as a reference drug, using as a basis for approval that drug’s efficacy and safety data on file at FDA, together with bioavailability/bioequivalence data and efficacy/safety data from our CTx-1302 clinical program.
 
CTx-2103: Buspirone product candidate for the treatment of anxiety related disorders
 
We have embarked on a program to develop CTx-2103 (buspirone) for the treatment of anxiety, which is the most common mental health concern in the U.S. We believe CTx-2103 has the potential to be the first once-daily formulation of buspirone, one of the most widely prescribed agents in the anxiety market. CTx-2103 is a novel, trimodal, extended-release tablet that contains the active pharmaceutical ingredient buspirone hydrochloride, a non-benzodiazepine medication, for which there is no evidence of the development or risk of dependency. However, due to its short half-life, buspirone is prescribed to be taken several times a day for management of anxiety, which can be challenging for patients and may lead to sub-optimal treatment outcomes. CTx-2103 will be designed as a once-daily, multi-dose tablet, which we believe will offer clear differentiation and compelling advantages over currently available treatment options.
 
Our CTx-2103 Clinical Development Program
 
In June 2022, we completed a human formulation study for CTx-2103. The first human subject study of CTx-2103 was a single-center, open-label, four-arm crossover study in 10 healthy subjects. Each participant received four different doses of buspirone at different assessment visits: one timed-release 10mg tablet releasing drug after a four-hour delay, one timed-release 10mg tablet releasing drug after an eight-hour delay, one triple-pulse 10mg tablet releasing drug at zero, four and eight hours, and one immediate release 10mg tablet of generic buspirone (the reference product, which is a commercially available formulation).
 
The primary objective was to evaluate the absorption of buspirone and the presence of metabolite 1-pyrimidinylpiperazine (1-PP) in blood plasma from time-delayed formulations and correlate this with scintigraphic time and site of release data. Secondary objectives of the study will compare the pharmacokinetic performance of the time delayed buspirone products with a commercially available formulation. Additionally, the study will evaluate the absorption of buspirone and the presence of metabolite 1-PP in blood plasma from a triple-release product.
 
Safety evaluations demonstrated that CTx-2103 is safe and well tolerated. No serious, severe, or clinically meaningful treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred during this study. Most TEAEs were mild in severity and were consistent with events expected for buspirone. The evaluation of TEAEs, laboratory examinations, physical examinations, ECG recordings, and measurement of vital signs (blood pressure and pulse rate) revealed no safety concerns for buspirone.

Based on the pharmacokinetic profile seen in the data from the formulation study, CTx-2103 achieved the desired triple release of buspirone hydrochloride. These positive results provided the critical information required to allow us to request a Pre-IND meeting with the FDA to discuss the design of our clinical and regulatory programs for anxiety, which we expect to occur in the third quarter of 2023 to allow for a potential IND filing in the fourth quarter of 2023. Furthermore, we may seek breakthrough therapy designation due to its potential ability to improve efficacy and outcomes and the potential to reduce the use of benzodiazepines.
 
Commercialization
 
Given our stage of development, we do not currently have any internal sales, marketing, or distribution infrastructure or capabilities. If CTx-1301 and/or CTx-1302 are approved, we plan to pursue commercialization of our product candidates in the United States, which we expect will be the first country in which we receive market authorization. We will need a commercial collaboration partner to benefit from their ability to provide us with more immediate access to marketing, sales, market access and distribution infrastructure to allow us to communicate with the majority of the high-volume neurology and psychiatry prescribers of ADHD medications and the high prescribing ADHD pediatricians and family practice providers.
 
In addition, we would expect to use multi-channel tactics, including non-personal strategies, to reach physicians, payers, patients and patient caregivers with the right frequency to help drive behavior. In addition to personal promotion, we intend to reach physicians through medical education, direct marketing, journal advertising and electronic health record communication. Advocacy groups, patients and caregivers are extremely active and vocal in the ADHD space. We expect that a direct-to-patient strategy would allow us to access this social group through focused education and advertising, as well as by employing appropriate social media listening and engagement to inform these patients and caregivers.
 
In March 2023, we entered into to a Joint Commercialization Agreement with Indegene. If we receive FDA approval for CTx-1301, Indegene will provide commercialization services for CTx-1301 pursuant to statements of work that will set forth, among other things, the services to be performed by Indegene, the deliverables for such services and the fees to be paid by us. Key services that Indegene is expected to provide, include: (a) medical affairs & pharmacovigilance; (b) pricing, reimbursement and market access; (c) commercial operations; and (d) marketing (including field force). See “Material Agreements – Joint Commercialization Agreement with Indegene, Inc.” below.
 
Manufacturing
 
Overview
 
We do not currently own or operate a manufacturing facility. Previously, we utilized Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Research Services, Inc. as our CDMO for the manufacture of our products used in pre-clinical research and clinical trials. In October 2022, we retained Societal CDMO, Inc. (Societal) as our new CDMO that will manufacture all clinical, registration, and commercial batches of our lead candidate CTx-1301. Societal will dedicate a specific manufacturing suite within its Gainesville, GA facility and outfit it with proprietary equipment owned by us.
 
Any third-party manufacturers, facilities, and all lots of drug substance and drug products used in our clinical trials are required to be in compliance with cGMPs. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities where our products are produced must meet cGMP requirements and FDA satisfaction before any product is approved and we can manufacture commercial products. Any third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. In addition, our drug products are classified as Class II controlled substances which requires any future third-party manufacturers to be approved and regulated by the DEA.

Drug Substance
 
We currently purchase the APIs used in CTx-1301 (Dexmethylphenidate) and CTx-1302 (Dextroamphetamine) and excipients from U.S. based third-party manufacturers. We anticipate entering into commercial supply agreements with many of these manufacturers in the future. Both APIs are controlled under U.S. federal law. Dexmethylphenidate, and dextroamphetamine are classified by the DEA as Schedule II controlled substances. As with all stimulate medications, there is a potential for abuse. Consequently, our procurements, manufacturing, shipping, dispensing and storing of our product candidates will be subject to regulation, as described in more detail under the “DEA Regulation” section included elsewhere in this prospectus.
Intellectual Property
 
Proprietary protection
 
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our drug candidates, manufacturing and process discoveries and other know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights. We have been building and continue to build our intellectual property portfolio relating to our ADHD drug candidates, and our innovative proprietary PTR drug delivery platform technology, and our technology platform. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and certain foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also intend to rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology.
 
Patent rights
 
We own or have licensed from BDD Pharma five patents and four patent applications in the United States and 85 patents and 16 patent applications in foreign countries and regions. In addition to the United States, we have patents issued or applications pending in Australia, Canada, China, Egypt, Europe (with pending applications before the European Patent Office and patents validated with certain member states of the European Patent Organization), Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia and South Korea. The patents and patent applications describe and claim certain features of our product candidates, our PTR drug delivery platform technology and our EBL, including claims to the product candidates, methods of making the product candidates and treatment methods using the product candidates.
 
We have and will continue to actively protect our intellectual property, including filing patent applications for our innovations, prosecuting our pending patent applications, and maintaining and enforcing our issued patents. No assurances can be given that pending patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or that the examination process will not require us to narrow our claims. In addition, issued patents may be circumvented by third parties, or found unenforceable or invalid if contested before a court or administrative agency. Thus, we may not be able to successfully enforce our patent rights against third parties. No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop a similar or competing technology or design around any patents that may be issued to us.
 
Patent life determination depends on the date of filing of the application and other factors as promulgated under the patent laws, such as patent term adjustments and extensions. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. The patents and, if granted, patent applications owned or licensed to us have expiry dates ranging from 2031 to 2036.

Trade secret and other protection
 
In addition to patented intellectual property, we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect our technology and maintain our competitive position, especially when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or can be obtained. Our policy is to require each of our employees, consultants and advisors to execute a confidentiality and inventions assignment agreement before beginning their employment, consulting or advisory relationship with us. The agreements generally provide that the individual must keep confidential and not disclose to other parties any confidential information developed or learned by the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us except in limited circumstances. These agreements generally also provide that we shall own all inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us.
 
Other intellectual property rights
 
We seek trademark protection in the United States when appropriate. We have filed for trademark protection for the Cingulate, Cingulate Therapeutics trade dress and mark, which we use with our pharmaceutical research and development as well as products, as well as trade names that could be used with our potential products. We currently have registered trademarks for Cingulate Therapeutics in the United States as well as for our PTR technology.
 
From time to time, we may find it necessary or prudent to obtain licenses from third party intellectual property holders.
 
Competition
 
Our industry has been exemplified by advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We may face competition from both pharmaceutical as well as generic drug companies as there are several short-acting and extended-release branded products with various formulations, some quite innovative as well as generic versions of these that have yet to satisfy the unmet medical need. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates include oral administration, therapeutic efficacy which includes immediate onset and entire active day duration, safety and tolerability profiles, market access and pricing. Some competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do; however, we believe the level of branded competition is diminishing and will continue to decline with the loss of exclusivity for Vyvanse. In addition, our prospective competitors may also have more experience and expertise in obtaining marketing approvals from the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. In addition to product development, testing, approval and promotion, other competitive factors in the pharmaceutical industry include consolidation, product quality and price, product technology, reputation, customer service and access to technical information. As a result, our prospective competitors may be able to develop competing or superior products and compete more aggressively and sustain their competitive advantage over a longer period of time than us. Our products may be rendered obsolete or may lack economic viability in the face of competition.
 
If approved, both CTx-1301 and CTx-1302 will compete against currently marketed, branded, and generic methylphenidate and amphetamine products for the treatment of ADHD. Some of these currently available products include Janssen’s Concerta, Novartis’ Focalin XR and Takeda’s Adderall XR and Vyvanse, which will lose exclusivity in 2023.
 
In recent years the ADHD market has seen the entrance of many innovative but niche-focused ADHD products that have not commanded the market share of previous oral stimulants, in particular the extended-release oral stimulants. We are aware that we face competition from small biotechnology companies focused in ADHD with niche products including Aytu, Tris, Corium, Ironshore, and Rhodes. However, we do not consider most of these companies to be significant competitors as their products are only capable of capturing small subsets of the overall market and do not employ substantial commercial efforts; whereas we believe our product candidates offer the potential to overcome longstanding unmet needs for the majority of ADHD patients. In addition, Cingulate, along with a potential commercialization partner, plans to employ appropriate resources to successfully commercialize its assets.

The FDA recently issued revised guidance for bioequivalence testing of generic extended-release methylphenidate. This new guidance makes it more difficult for new generic products to demonstrate bioequivalence to reference products. We believe this will limit generic competition in the methylphenidate market. It may be difficult for a generic product to show bioequivalence to a new branded, extended- release dexmethylphenidate drug with entire active day duration of effect, such as CTx-1301.
 
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local levels and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and ultimately approved by the applicable regulatory authority.
U.S. Drug Development
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approval and maintaining subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time, personnel, and financial resources. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, labeling, storage, packaging, recordkeeping, tracking, approval, import, export, distribution, advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. regulatory requirements at any time during product development, the approval process, or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, voluntary product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, consent decrees, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil and criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
Pharmaceutical product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed and sold in the United States. Cingulate intends to submit our NDAs under the 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway. Development and approval of drugs generally involves the following:
 

● | Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations or other applicable regulations; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (IND), which must become effective before clinical trials involving humans may begin; 


● | Approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before a trial may be initiated at that site; 
----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● ● | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, other good clinical practices (GCPs) and other clinical-trial related regulations to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication; Compiling of information demonstrating that the product can be properly formulated, manufactured and stored; 


25
--


● | Submission of an NDA to the FDA for marketing approval, including payment of application user fees; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMPs and assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Possible FDA audit of the clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data submitted in support of the NDA; and 
● | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review of the product candidate, where appropriate or if applicable, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the United States. 

Preclinical Studies
 
Before testing any drug product candidate in humans, it must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which support subsequent clinical testing. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin.
 
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product candidate chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies, to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety and toxicology studies. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after an IND for an investigational drug candidate is submitted to the FDA and human clinical trials have been initiated.
 
In the case of testing data to support a 505(b)(2) NDA, some or all of the necessary preclinical data may be referenced in literature or the FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy for an RLD.
 
Clinical Trials
 
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Study subjects must sign an informed consent form before participating in a clinical trial. There are also requirements governing the reporting of on-going clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. Clinical holds may also be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance.

In addition, an IRB representing each institution that is participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must thereafter conduct a continuing review and reapprove the trial at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the trial protocol and informed consent information to be provided to clinical trial subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Information about certain clinical trials, including details of the protocol and eventually study results, also must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on the ClinicalTrials.gov data registry. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in some cases for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Failure to timely register a covered clinical study or to submit study results as provided for in the law can give rise to civil monetary penalties and also prevent the non-compliant party from receiving future grant funds from the federal government. The NIH’s Final Rule on ClinicalTrials.gov registration and reporting requirements became effective in 2017, and both NIH and FDA have signaled the government’s willingness to begin enforcing those requirements against non-compliant clinical trial sponsors.
 
Clinical trials conducted to support an NDA are generally conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined.
 

● | Phase 1 - clinical trials generally involve a relatively small number of healthy volunteers who are initially exposed to a single dose or multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the safety, dosage tolerance, structure-activity relationships, mechanism of action, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion in healthy volunteers or subjects with the target disease or condition. Changes to this general format that are suitable to a product candidate or a specific patient population may occur but usually are agreed to in advance with the FDA. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase 2 - clinical trials typically involve studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
● | Phase 3 - clinical trials are undertaken in larger subject populations to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population, often at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing. These trials may be done globally to support global registrations so long as the global sites are also representative of the U.S. population and the conduct of the study at global sites comports with FDA regulations and guidance, such as compliance with GCPs. 

 
By following the 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway, the applicant may reduce some of the burden of developing a drug by relying on investigations not conducted by the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference, such as prior investigations involving the RLD. In such cases, some clinical trials may not be required or may be otherwise limited; however, Phase 1 trials to establish bioavailability and pharmacokinetic characteristics of the product candidate and at least one Phase 3 pivotal trial are usually required to support a 505(b)(2) NDA.
 
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
 
During the development of a new drug product, sponsors have the opportunity to meet with the FDA at certain points, including prior to submission of an IND, at the end of phase 2, and before submission of an NDA. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically meet with the agency before initiating Phase 3 clinical trials to present their plans for the pivotal trial that they believe will support approval of the new drug product.

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the drug product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
NDA and FDA Review Process
 
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with detailed descriptions of the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently over $3.24 million for an NDA with clinical information, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee, currently approximately $394,000. These fees are typically increased annually. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances. One such fee waiver is available for applicants that are small businesses, meaning the applicant (including any affiliates) employs fewer than 500 employees, does not have an approved marketing application for a product that has been introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, and is submitting its first marketing application.
 
Section 505(b)(1) and Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA are the provisions governing the type of NDAs that may be submitted under the FDCA. Section 505(b)(1) is the traditional pathway for new chemical entities when no other new drug containing the same active pharmaceutical ingredient or active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance, has been approved by the FDA. As an alternate pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations of previously approved products, a company may file a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference.
 
Once the FDA receives an application, it has 60 days to review the NDA to determine if it is substantially complete to permit a substantive review, before it accepts the application for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the applications. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) VI, the agency seeks to review applications for standard review drug products within 10 months from the filing acceptance date, and applications for priority review drugs within six months from the filing acceptance date. The FDA may grant a priority review designation to drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and that the agency determines offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process for both standard and priority reviews may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider additional, late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission in response to FDA review questions.
 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the product candidate to determine whether they comply with cGMPs, unless the facility has recently had an FDA inspection. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product to specifications. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation regarding whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers them carefully when making decisions. NDAs submitted under Section 505(b)(2) are typically not referred to an Advisory Panel for consideration unless new safety information is revealed in the review cycle.

As part of the NDA review process, the FDA likely will re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the IND protocol requirements and to assure the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA. The review and evaluation of an NDA by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all.
 
After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue either an approval letter or a complete response letter (CRL). An approval letter authorizes the commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and that the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL generally describes the deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA and may require substantial additional clinical data or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. Additionally, the CRL may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter to the applicant. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in response to an issued CRL in either two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with the submission of this additional information, however, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than the sponsor interprets the same data.
 
There is no assurance that the FDA will approve a product candidate for marketing, and the sponsor may encounter significant difficulties or costs during the review process. Even if a product receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, or it may condition approval on changes to the proposed labeling. The FDA also may condition approval on the development of adequate controls and specifications for manufacturing and a commitment to conduct post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the potential effects and efficacy. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and efficacy.
 
The FDA may also place restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) plan in addition to the approved labeling, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. A REMS could include medication guides for patients, communication plans for health care professionals, and/or elements to assure safe use (ETASU). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, restricted distribution requirements, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The FDA determines the requirement for a REMS, as well as the specific REMS provisions, on a case-by-case basis. If the FDA concludes a REMS plan is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS plan. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. Based on the required warnings included in the approved labeling of drug products containing the same drug substance as our product candidates (dexmethylphenidate and dextroamphetamine), we expect that as part of the NDA review and approval process, FDA will require at least some of our product candidates, in particular CTx-1301 and CTx-1302, to include black box warnings as part of their labeling.
 
Any of the above-mentioned limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products and therefore limit commercial success. Marketing approval may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing.
 
After NDA approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements, FDA notification, and FDA review and approval. Further, should new safety information arise, additional testing, product labeling or FDA notification may be required.

Hatch-Waxman Act and New Drug Marketing Exclusivity
 
Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute and also enacted Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the RLD. Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. In contrast, Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. A Section 505(b)(2) applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies, if it can establish that reliance on studies conducted for a previously-approved product is scientifically appropriate. Unlike the ANDA pathway used by developers of bioequivalent versions of innovator drugs, which does not allow applicants to submit new clinical data other than bioavailability or bioequivalence data, the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway does not preclude the possibility that a follow-on applicant would need to conduct additional clinical trials or nonclinical studies; for example, they may be seeking approval to market a previously approved drug for new indications or for a new patient population that would require new clinical data to demonstrate safety or effectiveness. The FDA may then approve the new product for all or some of the label indications for which the RLD has been approved, or for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant, as applicable.
 
In seeking approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, the NDA sponsor is required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the sponsor’s product or an approved method of using the product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is published in the FDA publication Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant submits its application to the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed in the Orange Book for the RLD, except for patents covering methods of use for which the follow-on applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent a Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, such an applicant is also required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.
 
Specifically, any applicant who subsequently files an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA that references the drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that with respect to each published patent, (i) the required patent information has not been filed by the original applicant of the RLD; (ii) the listed patent already has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a specified date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the new product. These are known as Paragraph I, II, III, and IV certifications, respectively.
 
If a Paragraph I or II certification is filed, the FDA may make approval of the application effective immediately upon completion of its review. If a Paragraph III certification is filed, the approval may be made effective on the patent expiration date specified in the application, although a tentative approval may be issued before that time. If an application contains a Paragraph IV certification, a series of events will be triggered, the outcome of which will determine the effective date of approval of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application.
 
A certification that the new product will not infringe the RLD’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the follow-on applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders for the RLD once the applicant’s NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a legal challenge to the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of their receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant. Alternatively, if the listed patent holder does not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the required 45-day period, the follow-on applicant’s ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA will not be subject to the 30-month stay.
 
In addition, under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the referenced RLD has expired. These market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of a NDA for a drug containing a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement.

The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving follow-on applications for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity also will not delay the submission or approval of a traditional NDA filed under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. However, an applicant submitting a traditional NDA would be required to either conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 
Patent Term Extension
 
After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent term extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase – the time between when the IND becomes effective and NDA submission – and all of the review phase – the time between NDA submission and approval, up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years. For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.
Pediatric Clinical Trials and Exclusivity
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), an NDA or certain types of supplements to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers.
 
For purposes of satisfying the requirements of PREA, the appropriate age ranges to be studied may vary, depending on the pharmacology of the drug or biological product, the manifestations of the disease in various age groups, and the ability to measure the response to therapy. PREA requires pediatric assessments to be gathered “using appropriate formulations for each age group for which the assessment is required” (section 505B(a)(2)(A) of the Act). Under PREA, applicants must submit requests for approval of the pediatric formulation used in their pediatric studies, and failure to submit such a request may render the product misbranded (section 505B(d) of the Act). FDA interprets the language “request for approval of a pediatric formulation” to mean that applicants must submit an application or supplemental application for any not previously approved formulation(s) used to conduct their pediatric studies.
 
The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, which was signed into law on July 9, 2012, amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit an NDA for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (iPSP) within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 trial. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric trial(s) that the sponsor plans to conduct, including objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric trials along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP, but the sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and other clinical development programs. We have submitted our iPSP, and it was accepted. We continue to be in discussions with the FDA regarding our PREA obligations.

The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity – patent or non-patent – for a drug if certain conditions are met, including satisfaction of a pediatric trial(s) agreed with FDA as a Pediatric Written Request. Conditions for pediatric exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric clinical trials, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested clinical trials within the statutory timeframe. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to the written request from the FDA for such data. Those data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. Although this is not a patent term extension, it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application.
 
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on the website www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of a clinical trial are then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of clinical trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of clinical development programs as well as clinical trial design.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Following approval of a drug product, the manufacturer and the approved drug product are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, product sampling and distribution restrictions, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations (i.e., “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective advertising, consent decrees and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA. Prescription drug promotional materials also must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the approved drug product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials.
 
FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our product candidates must meet cGMP requirements and satisfy the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities’ satisfaction before any product is approved and our commercial products can be manufactured. These manufacturers must comply with cGMPs that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMPs, could result in enforcement actions including cessation of manufacturing activities. The discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including recalls and product seizures.
 

32
--

 

Further, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented, or FDA notification. If there are any modifications to the drug, including changes to indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a supplemental NDA or new NDA, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional pharmaceutical development/formulation studies, nonclinical studies or clinical trials.
 
Once an approval of a prescription drug is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | fines, warning letters or other enforcement-related letters or clinical holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals; 
● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; 
● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; 
● | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal health care programs; and 
● | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information. 

 
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products, including samples, is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA), which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws regulate the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 
Moreover, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) was enacted in 2013 with the aim of building an electronic system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States. The DSCSA mandates phased-in and resource-intensive obligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers over a 10-year period that is expected to culminate in November 2023. From time to time, new legislation and regulations may be implemented that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of prescription drug products regulated by the FDA. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or regulatory changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.

DEA Regulation
 
The active ingredients in our current drug product candidates are listed by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, as controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (CSA). The CSA and its implementing regulations establish a closed chain of distribution for entities handling controlled substances and impose registration, record-keeping and reporting, security, storage, procurement, manufacturing, distribution, importation, exportation, labeling, packaging, and other requirements on such entities. The DEA requires individuals or entities that handle controlled substances to comply with these requirements to ensure legitimate use and prevent diversion of controlled substances to illicit channels of commerce.
 
The CSA categorizes controlled substances into one of five schedules, Schedule I, II, III, IV or V, depending on the potential for abuse and physical or psychological dependence. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse, have no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the U.S. and lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision. They may not be marketed or sold for dispensing to patients in the U.S. Pharmaceutical products having a currently accepted medical use and that are otherwise approved for marketing may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV, or V substances, with Schedule II substances presenting the highest potential for abuse and physical or psychological dependence, and Schedule V substances presenting the lowest relative potential for abuse and dependence. Schedule II substances (as well as substances defined as narcotics in any Schedule) are subject to the strictest requirements for registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting, and the distribution and dispensing of these substances are highly regulated. For example, all Schedule II drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician, physically presented to a pharmacist in most situations, unless they are electronically prescribed pursuant to DEA regulations, and may not be refilled. The active ingredients in our product candidates (dexmethylphenidate and dextroamphetamine) are Schedule II controlled substances and are under various restrictions. Consequently, the procurement, manufacturing, shipping, storage, sales and use of the products, if approved, will be subject to a high degree of regulation.
 
Facilities that manufacture, distribute, import or export controlled substances must register annually with the DEA. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized. Similarly, separate registrations are also required for separate facilities.
 
The DEA inspects manufacturers, distributors, importers, and exporters to review compliance with the CSA and DEA regulations, including security, record keeping and reporting prior to issuing a controlled substance registration and on a periodic basis. The specific security requirements vary by the type of business activity and the schedule and quantity of controlled substances handled by the registrant, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as vaults and inventory reconciliations. Manufacturers and distributors must also submit regular reports to the DEA of the distribution of Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III narcotic substances, and other designated substances. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances, for example, a complete and accurate record of each substance manufactured, received, sold, delivered, or otherwise disposed of. All DEA registrants must also report any controlled substance thefts or significant losses and must obtain authorization to destroy or dispose of controlled substances. In addition to maintaining an importer and/or exporter registration, importers and exporters of controlled substances must obtain a permit for every import or export of a Schedule I or II substance and a narcotic substance in Schedule III, IV and V. For all other drugs in Schedule III, IV and V, importers and exporters must submit an import or export declaration.
 
In addition, a DEA quota system controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much of a controlled substance may be produced in total in the United States based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. The limited aggregate number of opioids and stimulants that the DEA allows to be produced in the United States each year is allocated among individual companies, which must submit applications annually to the DEA for individual production and procurement quotas. We must receive an annual quota from the DEA in order to produce or procure our Schedule II substance for use in manufacturing of our product and product candidates. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. Distributions of any Schedule I or II controlled substance must also be accompanied by special order forms, with copies provided to the DEA.

Failure to maintain compliance with applicable DEA requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion or controlled substances, can result in administrative, civil or criminal enforcement action. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate administrative proceedings to revoke those registrations. In some circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution.
 
The various states and the District of Columbia also regulate controlled substances and impose similar licensing, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements on entities that handle controlled substances. Entities must independently comply with the various state requirements in addition to the federal controlled substance requirements.
 
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States, sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors, such as state and federal governmental authorities, including those that administer the Medicare and Medicaid programs, managed care organizations and private insurers. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for each of our product candidates will be made on a plan-by-plan basis. The Medicare and Medicaid programs are often used as models by private payors and other governmental payors to develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs. However, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage, and adequate reimbursement, for the product. Each third-party payor determines whether or not it will provide coverage for a drug, what amount it will pay providers for the drug, and on what tier of its formulary the drug will be placed. These decisions are influenced by the existence of multiple drug products within a therapeutic class and the net cost to the plan, including the amount of the prescription price, if any, rebated by the drug’s manufacturer. Typically, generic versions of drugs are placed in a preferred tier. The position of a drug on the formulary generally determines the co-payment that a patient will need to make to obtain the drug and can strongly influence the adoption of a drug by patients and physicians. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided, and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Additionally, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Also, third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. As a result, coverage, reimbursement and placement determinations are complex and are often the subject of extensive negotiations between the payor and the owner of the drug.
 
Unless we enter into a strategic collaboration under which our collaborator assumes responsibility for seeking coverage and reimbursement for a given product, we will be responsible for negotiating coverage, reimbursement and placement decisions for our product candidates. Coverage, reimbursements and placement decisions for a new product are based on many factors including the coverage, reimbursement and placement of already marketed branded drugs for the same or similar indications, the safety and efficacy of the new product, availability of generics for similar indications, the clinical need for the new product and the cost-effectiveness of the product.
 
Within the Medicare program, CTx-1301, CTx-1302 and CTx-2103, which, if approved would likely be self-administered drugs, would likely be reimbursed under the expanded prescription drug benefit known as Medicare Part D. This program is a voluntary Medicare benefit administered by private plans that operate under contracts with the federal government. These plans develop formularies that determine which products are covered and what co-pay will apply to covered drugs. The plans have considerable discretion in establishing formularies and tiered co-pay structures, negotiating rebates with manufacturers and placing prior authorization and other restrictions on the utilization of specific products, subject to review by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for discriminatory practices. These Part D plans negotiate discounts with drug manufacturers, which are passed on, in whole or in part, to each of the plan’s enrollees through reduced premiums.
 
If a drug product is reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid, pricing and rebate programs must comply with, as applicable, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 as well as the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA) and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, each as amended. Among other things, the OBRA requires drug manufacturers to pay rebates on prescription drugs to state Medicaid programs and empowers states to negotiate rebates on pharmaceutical prices, which may result in prices for our future products that will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply.

Third-party payors, including the U.S. government, continue to apply downward pressure on the reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 reduces the US government reimbursement for some drugs. Also, the trend towards managed health care in the United States and the concurrent growth of organizations such as health maintenance organizations may result in lower reimbursement for pharmaceutical products. We expect that these trends will continue as these payors implement various proposals or regulatory policies. There are currently, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement controls on reimbursement and pricing, directly and indirectly.
 
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
As we are commercializing our product candidates, if they are approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory agencies for marketing, we will be subject to additional healthcare statutory and regulatory requirements and enforcement by federal government and the states and foreign governments in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any other product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our arrangements with third-party payors and customers expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval.
 
Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:
 

● | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations. In the past, the government has enforced the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalty laws, prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. government, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. government. Actions under these laws may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. The federal government uses these laws, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the U.S., for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other allegedly unlawful sales and marketing practices; 


● | The U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) created new federal, civil and criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;

● | The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, PPACA), among other things, imposes reporting requirements on manufacturers of FDA-approved drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report, on an annual basis, to CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, chiropractors and, beginning in 2022 for payments and other transfers of value provided in the previous year, certain advanced non-physician health care practitioners), teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) and their respective implementing regulations impose specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions; 
● | Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; 
● | State laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures to the extent that those laws impose requirements that are more stringent than the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, as well as state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and 
● | State laws and foreign laws and regulations (particularly European Union laws regarding personal data relating to individuals based in Europe) that govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

 
In November 2020, HHS finalized significant changes to the regulations implementing the Anti-Kickback Statute, with the goal of offering the healthcare industry more flexibility and reducing the regulatory burden associated with those fraud and abuse laws, particularly with respect to value-based arrangements among industry participants.
 
Ensuring that our current and future business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations involves substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities may conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including monetary damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA, exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, or additional reporting requirements if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with any of these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.

Healthcare Reform and Potential Changes to Healthcare Laws
 
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our future products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. The FDA’s and other regulatory authorities’ policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we otherwise may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access.
 
By way of example, PPACA was enacted in March 2010 and has had a significant impact on the health care industry in the United States. PPACA expanded coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to biopharmaceutical products, PPACA, among other things, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program.
 
As another example, the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act signed into law on December 27, 2020, incorporated extensive healthcare provisions and amendments to existing laws, including a requirement that all manufacturers of drugs and biological products covered under Medicare Part B report the product’s average sales price to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) beginning on January 1, 2022, subject to enforcement via civil money penalties.
 
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the PPACA that affect health care expenditures. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, (CARES Act), which was signed into law on March 27, 2020 and was designed to provide financial support and resources to individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, and extended the sequester by one year, through 2030, in order to offset the added expense of the 2020 cancellation. The 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act was subsequently signed into law on December 27, 2020 and extended the CARES Act suspension period to March 31, 2021. The most recently enacted pandemic-relief legislation, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which was signed into law on March 11, 2021, also includes significant healthcare system reforms and programs intended to strengthen the insurance marketplace established under the PPACA, among others. In addition, other legislative changes that affect the pharmaceutical industry have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 included, among other things, a provision that authorizes CMS to negotiate a “maximum fair price” for a limited number of high-cost, single-source drugs every year, and another provision that requires drug companies to pay rebates to Medicare if prices rise faster than inflation.
 
Moreover, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. DHHS has solicited feedback on some of various measures intended to lower drug prices and reduce the out of pocket costs of drugs and implemented others under its existing authority. For example, in May 2019, DHHS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified a DHHS policy change that was effective January 1, 2019. Congress and the executive branch have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs, making this area subject to ongoing uncertainty.

Individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In December 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court held unanimously that federal law does not preempt the states’ ability to regulate pharmaceutical benefit managers (PBMs) and other members of the health care and pharmaceutical supply chain, an important decision that may lead to further and more aggressive efforts by states in this area.
 
The FDA’s and other regulatory authorities’ policies also may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our drug candidates. For example, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act) was signed into law. The Cures Act, among other things, is intended to modernize the regulation of drugs and devices and to spur innovation, but its ultimate implementation is uncertain. In addition, in August 2017, the FDA Reauthorization Act was signed into law, which reauthorized the FDA’s user fee programs and included additional drug and device provisions that build on the Cures Act. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
 
We expect that the PPACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs, once regulatory approval is obtained. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, including any future pharmaceutical products for which we secure marketing approval.
 
Data Privacy and the Protection of Personal Information
 
We are regulated by laws and regulations governing data privacy, security, and the protection of personal information, including health information, that are applicable to our business and associated data processing activities. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues globally which will continue to affect our business. In the United States, we may be subject to state security breach notification laws, state laws protecting the privacy and security of health and personal information and federal and state consumer protections laws which regulate the collection, use, disclosure and transmission of personal information. These laws may overlap and conflict with each other, and each of these laws is subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us. If we fail to comply with applicable data protection laws and regulations we could be subject to penalties or sanctions, including criminal penalties. Our current and future customers and research partners must comply with laws governing the privacy and security of health information, including HIPAA and state health information privacy laws. If we knowingly obtain health information that is protected under HIPAA, called “protected health information,” without observing the correct protocols which may include execution of a business associate agreement, implementation of privacy or security measures, and other obligations, our customers or research collaborators may be subject to enforcement actions, and we may have direct liability for the unlawful receipt of protected health information or for aiding and abetting a HIPAA violation.

State laws protecting health and personal information are becoming increasingly stringent. For example, California has implemented the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, which imposes restrictive requirements regulating the use and disclosure of health information and other personally identifiable information, and in 2020 California implemented the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA). The CCPA reflects several key concepts included in the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The CCPA establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information, establishing new data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California, imposing special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, and creating a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. On January 1, 2023, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) entered into force and significantly modified the CCPA. This may result in further uncertainty, additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply, as well as additional potential for harm and liability for failure to comply. In addition to California, five other states – Colorado, Connecticut, Nevada, Utah and Virginia – have enacted data privacy laws, and other states in the U.S. are considering privacy laws similar to CCPA/CPRA. Nevada’s online privacy law (which was amended in 2021) is already in force. The Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act entered into force on January 1, 2023, and the Privacy Acts of Colorado and Connecticut will become effective on July 1, 2023. Most recently, Utah legislators passed the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, which will take effect on December 31, 2023
 
When we do business and/or conduct clinical trials in the UK or the EEA (i.e. the EU plus Liechtenstein, Norway and Iceland), we are subject to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) as well as the GDPR as saved into United Kingdom law by virtue of section 3 of the United Kingdom’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and the UK’s Data Protection Act 2018 (“DPA 2018”) (the “UK GDPR”). The GDPR and UK GDPR apply to business colleagues, employees, service providers, trial participants and other individuals like investigators or CRO employees who are residents of the UK or EEA. Violations of the UK GDPR and/or the GDPR can carry hefty fines of up to EUR 20 million / £17.5 million or 4% of the total annual worldwide revenue in the preceding financial year, whichever is higher.
 
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 
In general, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, prohibits offering to pay, paying, promising to pay, or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to a foreign official in order to influence any act or decision of the foreign official in his or her official capacity or to secure any other improper advantage in order to obtain or retain business for or with, or in order to direct business to, any person. The prohibitions apply not only to payments made to “any foreign official,” but also those made to “any foreign political party or official thereof,” to “any candidate for foreign political office” or to any person, while knowing that all or a portion of the payment will be offered, given, or promised to anyone in any of the foregoing categories. “Foreign officials” under the FCPA include officers or employees of a department, agency, or instrumentality of a foreign government. The term “instrumentality” is broad and can include state-owned or state-controlled entities. Importantly, United States authorities deem most healthcare professionals and other employees of foreign hospitals, clinics, research facilities and medical schools in countries with public healthcare and/or public education systems to be “foreign officials” under the FCPA. When we interact with foreign healthcare professionals and researchers in testing and marketing our products abroad, should any of our product candidates receive foreign regulatory approval in the future, we must have policies and procedures in place sufficient to prevent us and agents acting on our behalf from providing any bribe, gift or gratuity, including excessive or lavish meals, travel or entertainment in connection with marketing our products and services or securing required permits and approvals. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Material Agreements
 
Joint Commercialization Agreement with Indegene, Inc.
 
On March 7, 2023, we entered into a Joint Commercialization Agreement (the “Commercialization Agreement”) with Indegene, Inc. (“Indegene”). 
 
The Commercialization Agreement governs the general terms under which Indegene will provide commercialization services for CTx-1301, if we receive FDA approval for CTx-1301, upon our request. Pursuant to the Commercialization Agreement, the parties will enter into statements of work that will set forth, among other things, the services to be performed by Indegene, the deliverables for such services, and the fees to be paid by us. Each statement of work will be governed by the terms of the Commercialization Agreement, unless expressly modified in such statement of work. We may elect to receive the following services from Indegene: (a) medical affairs & pharmacovigilance; (b) pricing, reimbursement and market access; (c) commercial operations; and (d) marketing (including field force). The parties will negotiate in good faith any changes to the services provided by Indegene due to changes in circumstances or priorities established by us.

The Commercialization Agreement will expire three years after the launch of CTx-1301. We may terminate the Commercialization Agreement upon six (6) months prior written notice to Indegene, and Indegene may terminate the Commercialization Agreement upon twelve (12) months prior written notice to us. In addition, either party may terminate the Commercialization Agreement upon thirty (30) days prior, written notice if: (i) the FDA notifies us that it will not approve our NDA for CTx-1301; or (ii) we suspend or terminate our clinical development program for CTx-1301 in the United States. Either party may terminate the Commercialization Agreement upon thirty (30) days prior, written notice for material, uncured breaches or immediately in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy.
 
During the term of the Commercialization Agreement, except for medical information services, the development and publication of peer-reviewed articles and pharmacovigilance services, Indegene will not provide strategic health care provider and/or patient marketing support (or any other types of services that are in the same category) to any party except us with respect to any ADHD product. Until the date of any notice of termination of the Commercialization Agreement or any notice of termination of a given service, we will not engage a party other than Indegene to provide any services with respect to commercialization of CTx-1301 that are in the same category as any of the services being provided to us by Indegene without Indegene’s written approval, not to be unreasonably withheld, subject to certain exceptions.
 
The Commercialization Agreement contains representations, warranties, confidentiality and indemnity obligations customary for agreements of this type.
 
Master Services Agreement with Societal CDMO, Inc.
 
Effective October 24, 2022, we entered into a master services agreement with Societal (the “Manufacturing Agreement”). The Manufacturing Agreement governs the general terms under which Societal, or one of its affiliates, will provide manufacturing services as specified by us at Societal’s Gainesville, Georgia manufacturing facility. Such services are performed under agreed statements of work. Under the terms of the Manufacturing Agreement, we have agreed to pay fees for Societal’s performance of services as provided in each applicable statement of work.
 
The Manufacturing Agreement terminates in October 2027 or such later date as required to complete a statement of work (the “Initial Term”) and will renew automatically thereafter for successive twelve (12) month periods (a “Renewal Term”) unless terminated by either party at least twelve (12) months (if prior to the successful completion of process validation batches for the first product) or twenty-four (24) months (after successful completion of validation batches for the first product) prior to the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term. The term of each statement of work terminates upon completion of the services under such statement of work, unless terminated earlier. We may terminate the Manufacturing Agreement or any statement of work upon ninety (90) days prior, written notice to Societal. Societal may terminate a statement of work due to certain delays or inactivity or if the services provided under such statement of work cannot be performed in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements; provided, that Societal shall use commercially reasonable efforts to engage in meaningful discussions with us prior to any such termination. Societal may terminate the Agreement upon six (6) months prior, written notice if all statements of work have been terminated. The Manufacturing Agreement or a statement of work may be terminated by either party for material, uncured breaches or in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy.
 
The Manufacturing Agreement includes customary terms relating to, among others, indemnification, intellectual property protection, confidentiality, remedies and warranties.

Patent and Know-How License Agreement with BDD Pharma Limited
 
We entered into a patent and know-how license agreement with BDD Pharma Limited (“BDD Pharma”) in August 2018, which we refer to as the BDD Pharma License Agreement. Pursuant to the BDD Pharma License Agreement, we have an exclusive license under technology, patents and know-how owned or controlled by BDD Pharma and relating to a barrier layer for controlled drug release in order to develop, manufacture, market, use, import, sell or otherwise supply and commercialize products that (i) deliver three distinct doses of dextroamphetamine, dexmethylphenidate or any methylphenidate based or any amphetamine based drug, (ii) have an extended release in vitro over a period of more than eight hours or (iii) are otherwise covered by the patents or are made, developed or used in accordance with the know-how. We also have the right to apply for marketing approvals and carry out clinical trials for the purpose of obtaining marketing approvals of such products. The rights granted to us are worldwide and exclusive in the field of the treatment of any disease or disorder in humans amenable to treatment with a methylphenidate-based or amphetamine-based drug or mixture or combination thereof. We have the right to sublicense the rights granted to us, subject to certain conditions.
 
BDD Pharma was entitled to a payment of $198,625 in connection with execution of the BDD Pharma License Agreement. We may be required to pay BDD Pharma aggregate milestone payments of $750,000 for each product in connection with clinical trial and regulatory milestones, with different dose strengths of a product being considered the same product for purposes of milestone payments. We may be required to pay BDD Pharma low to mid-single digit royalties on aggregate net sales of products. We may also be required to pay BDD Pharma low to mid-single digit royalties on aggregate net receipts of products based on sales made by our sublicensees and non-royalty sublicensing consideration that we receive.
 
Unless terminated earlier, the term of the BDD Pharma License Agreement continues until the later of the expiration of the last-to-expire of all the patents licensed to us or the last-to-expire of all of our payment obligations. Our royalty payment obligations expire on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon the later of 10 years from the first commercial sale of a product in a country or expiration of the last-to-expire patent covering the manufacture, use or sale of the product in a country. Currently, the last-to expire patent licensed from BDD Pharma expires in November of 2035. Upon expiration of our royalty payment obligations, the licenses granted to us become fully-paid, irrevocable and perpetual.
 
We, or BDD Pharma, may terminate the BDD Pharma License Agreement if there is an uncured material breach by the other party or in connection with the other party’s insolvency. BDD Pharma may terminate the BDD Pharma License Agreement immediately upon written notice if we, any sublicensee or related party or affiliate directly challenges, or assists a third party in challenging, the validity or enforcement of the patents owned by BDD Biopharma or the secret nature of the know-how.
 
Human Capital Resources
 
To achieve our goals, it is crucial that we attract and retain talented employees. To facilitate this, we strive to maintain a safe and rewarding workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by competitive pay, comprehensive benefits and health and wellness programs, and programs that build connections among our employees. Our compensation program includes the granting of stock options to attract, retain, and incentivize employees.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 15 full-time employees. Of these, six are engaged in full-time research and development and manufacturing activities, and nine in full-time general and administrative functions. All of our employees are located in the United States. We utilize outside consultants and independent contractors to supplement our full-time workforce. None of our employees are represented by a labor organization or are under a collective-bargaining arrangement. We consider our employee relations to be good.

Facilities
 
Our corporate headquarters is located in Kansas City, Kansas, where we lease approximately 14,205 square feet of office space. Our lease expires in May 2025, with an option to extend. Our manufacturing activities take place at Societal, our CDMO in Gainesville, Georgia. We believe our current offices, laboratories, and manufacturing spaces are sufficient to meet our needs. We may seek to negotiate new leases or evaluate additional or alternate space to accommodate operations. We believe that appropriate alternative space is readily available on commercially reasonable terms.
