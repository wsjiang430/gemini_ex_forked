Item 1. Business
OVERVIEW
We are a late-stage development biopharmaceutical company, with an ongoing registration directed trial, committed to advancing new medicines for patients battling cancer. Our pipeline is focused on novel anticancer agents that inhibit critical signaling pathways in cancer that promote cancer cell survival and tumor growth, particularly RAF/MEK inhibition and FAK inhibition.
Our most advanced product candidates, avutometinib (VS-6766) and defactinib, are being investigated in both preclinical and clinical studies for the treatment of various solid tumors, including, but not limited to low-grade serous ovarian cancer (“LGSOC”), non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”), colorectal cancer (“CRC”), pancreatic cancer, and melanoma. We believe that avutometinib may be beneficial as a therapeutic, as a single agent or when used together in combination with defactinib, other agents, other pathway inhibitors, or other current and emerging standard of care treatments in cancers that do not adequately respond to currently available therapies.
Avutometinib is an orally available first-in-class unique small molecule RAF/MEK clamp. In contrast to other MEK inhibitors that are commercially available and in development, avutometinib is a dual RAF/MEK clamp that blocks MEK kinase activity and induces the formation of dominant negative RAF-MEK complexes preventing phosphorylation of MEK by A-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (“ARAF”), B-Raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase (“BRAF”) and C-raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase (“CRAF”). MEK-only inhibitors (e.g. trametinib) may have limited efficacy because they induce MEK phosphorylation (“pMEK”) by relieving extracellular-signal-regulated-kinase (“ERK”)-dependent feedback inhibition of RAF. By inhibiting RAF-mediated phosphorylation of MEK, avutometinib has the advantage of not inducing pMEK. This unique mechanism of avutometinib enables it to inhibit ERK signaling more effectively and may confer enhanced therapeutic activity against mitogen-activated pathway kinase (“MAPK”) pathway-driven cancers.
Avutometinib has been shown to inhibit signaling and proliferation of tumor cell lines with a variety of MAPK pathway alterations including Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (“KRAS”), neuroblastoma rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (“NRAS”), and BRAF mutations, among others. Avutometinib has demonstrated strong antitumor activity in combination with (i) agents targeting parallel pathways (e.g. inhibitors of FAK, CDK4/6 and mTOR), (ii) agents targeting other nodes in the MAPK pathway (e.g. anti-EGFR, SOS1, KRAS G12C, and KRAS G12D inhibitors), (iii) chemotherapy, and (iv) anti-PD-1.
Defactinib is an oral small molecule inhibitor of FAK and proline-rich tyrosine kinase (“PYK2”) that is currently being evaluated as a potential combination therapy for various solid tumors. FAK is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by the protein tyrosine kinase-2 (“PTK-2”) gene that is involved in cellular adhesion and, in cancer, metastatic capability. Defactinib targets malignant cells both directly and through modulation of the tumor microenvironment. Defactinib has received orphan drug designation in ovarian cancer in the United States, the European Union, and Australia. Preclinical research by our scientists and collaborators at world-renowned research institutions has described the effect of FAK inhibition as enhancing immune response by decreasing immuno-suppressive cells, increasing cytotoxic T cells and reducing stromal density, which allows tumor-killing immune cells to enter the tumor. Furthermore, it has been shown that FAK activation in response to MAPK inhibitor therapy may bypass MAPK pathway blockade by driving tumor growth through activation of downstream pathways such as RhoA and YAP, supporting the clinical evaluation of avutometinib in combination with defactinib for treatment of cancers harboring MAPK alterations. 
The combination of avutometinib and defactinib has been found to be clinically active in some patients with KRAS mutant and KRAS wild-type LGSOC and has received breakthrough designation from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (the “FDA”) for the treatment of all patients with recurrent LGSOC, regardless of KRAS status, after one or more prior lines of therapy including platinum-based chemotherapy.

In the fourth quarter of 2020, we commenced two registration-directed trials investigating avutometinib as a monotherapy and in combination with defactinib. The registration-directed trials are entitled RAMP 201 and RAMP 202. RAMP 201 is an adaptive two-part multicenter, parallel cohort, randomized, open label trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of avutometinib alone and in combination with defactinib in patients with recurrent LGSOC. RAMP 202 is a Phase 2, adaptive two-part multicenter, parallel cohort, randomized, open-label trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of avutometinib alone and in combination with defactinib in patients with KRAS G12V NSCLC, following treatment with a platinum-based regimen and immune checkpoint inhibitor. Additionally, and based on preclinical rationale, we added additional cohorts to the RAMP 202 study including KRAS non-G12V NSCLC and BRAF mutant (V600E and non-V600E) NSCLC. Both studies are discussed in greater detail below.
In January 2023, we reported data from a planned interim analysis of Part A of the ongoing RAMP 201 trial among patients with LGSOC treated with avutometinib alone and in combination with defactinib. Part A included randomized eligible patients to receive treatment of avutometinib monotherapy (n=33) or the combination of avutometinib and defactinib (n=31). The combination of avutometinib and defactinib has been declared the go-forward treatment regimen based on a higher rate of confirmed objective responses in a planned interim analysis with prespecified criteria.
Of the 29 patients evaluable for response by blinded independent central review (“BICR”) in the combination arm, the initial results showed a confirmed objective response rate (“ORR”) of 28% in all patients and 27% vs 29% in KRAS mutant (n=15) and KRAS wild-type (n=14) LGSOC, respectively. Three additional patients with KRAS mutant LGSOC showed an unconfirmed partial response. In addition, the vast majority of patients showed tumor regression, as the overall disease control rate (stable disease plus partial response) was 93%. Most evaluable patients (62%) were still on study treatment on the combination arm at the time of the data cut with a minimum follow-up of five months.
The confirmed ORR for the monotherapy arm by BICR was 7% in evaluable patients (n=30). The overall disease control rate for the monotherapy arm by BICR was 90%. Across both the combination and monotherapy arms, there have been no additional safety signals reported with a continued favorable safety and tolerability profile, with 9% discontinuation due to adverse events in the combination arm. 
We will continue future enrollment of RAMP 201 in the combination arm only in all patients with recurrent LGSOC, regardless of their KRAS status. Target enrollment for the combination arm has been achieved. We are planning a RAMP 201 presentation at a scientific medical conference in 2023.
In the fourth quarter of 2022, a type B meeting with the FDA was held to discuss the results to date of the ongoing RAMP 201 trial, confirm the go-forward treatment regimen selection and discuss the regulatory path forward. The combination of avutometinib with defactinib has been selected versus monotherapy as the go-forward treatment in all recurrent LGSOC regardless of KRAS status, acknowledging the demonstrated contribution of defactinib.
We intend to include mature data from the RAMP 201 study and the FRAME study to potentially support filing for accelerated approval in patients with recurrent LGSOC. Both studies are evaluating avutometinib and defactinib in patients with recurrent LGSOC. We are in ongoing discussions with the FDA on the confirmatory study and plan to provide an update after agreement with the FDA. Continued enrollment in the combination arm of RAMP 201 is planned to expand the clinical experience in anticipation of initiation of a confirmatory study.
In October 2022, we reported data from a planned interim analysis of Part A from the RAMP 202 trial among patients with KRAS G12V NSCLC treated with avutometinib or the combination of avutometinib and defactinib. The results did not meet the pre-defined criteria to continue to the trial expansion phase. Among patients with KRAS non-G12V NSCLC, no KRAS subtype was identified for further clinical evaluation of avutometinib with defactinib in this trial.

In September 2021, we entered into a clinical collaboration agreement with Amgen, Inc. (“Amgen”) to evaluate the combination of avutometinib with Amgen’s KRAS G12C inhibitor LUMAKRAS® (sotorasib) in a Phase 1/2 trial entitled RAMP 203. The Phase 1/2 trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of avutometinib in combination with LUMAKRAS in patients with KRAS G12C NSCLC who have not been

previously treated with a KRAS G12C inhibitor, as well as in patients who have progressed on a KRAS-G12C inhibitor. The study will investigate the potential benefits of a more complete vertical blockade of the MAPK pathway with the combination of avutometinib (RAF/MEK inhibition) with LUMAKRAS (KRAS G12C inhibition) in KRAS G12C locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. The RAMP 203 trial has advanced to cohort 2 of 4 mg avutometinib in combination with 960 mg of LUMAKRAS.
In November 2021, we entered into a clinical collaboration agreement with Mirati Therapeutics, Inc. (“Mirati”) to evaluate the combination of avutometinib with Mirati’s KRAS G12C inhibitor KRAZATI® (adagrasib) in a Phase 1/2 trial entitled RAMP 204. The Phase 1/2 trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of avutometinib in combination with KRAZATI in patients with KRAS G12C NSCLC who have progressed on a KRAS G12C inhibitor. The trial will build on preclinical data showing a deeper blockade of MAPK pathway signaling resulting in enhanced anti-tumor efficacy with the combination of KRAZATI  (KRAS G12C inhibition) and avutometinib (RAF/MEK inhibition) relative to either agent alone. The RAMP 204 trial is open and enrolling.
In May 2022, we received the first “Therapeutic Accelerator Award” from the Pancreatic Cancer Network (“PanCAN”) for up to $3.8 million. The grant is expected to support a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of avutometinib in combination with defactinib entitled RAMP 205. This Phase 1b/2 trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of GEMZAR® (gemcitabine) and ABRAXANE® (Nab-paclitaxel) in combination with avutometinib and defactinib in patients with previously untreated metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. The RAMP 205 trial will evaluate whether combining avutometinib (to target mutant KRAS which is mutated in more than 90% of pancreatic tumors) and defactinib (to reduce stromal density and adaptive resistance to avutometinib) to the standard GEMZAR/ABRAXANE regimen improves outcomes for patients with pancreatic cancer. In August 2022, PanCAN agreed to provide us with an additional $0.5 million for the collection and analysis of patient samples. We received $1.0 million of cash proceeds in July 2022. We opened the RAMP 205 trial in the fourth quarter of 2022. 
Avutometinib and defactinib are currently being investigated in combination with immunotherapeutic and other agents through investigator sponsored trials (“ISTs”).

OUR FOCUS
We are focused on the development and commercialization of anticancer kinase inhibitors for optimized efficacy and safety – primarily as orally available drugs and drug candidates that are designed to treat various forms of cancer. Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. The American Cancer Society estimated that in the United States in 2022, over 1.9 million new cases of cancer were diagnosed and more than 600,000 people died from the disease. Current treatments for cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, cell therapy, and targeted therapy. Notwithstanding years of intensive research and clinical use, these current treatments often fail to cure cancer. For example, conventional chemotherapy works by stopping tumor growth by disrupting the cell cycle leading to cell death. Chemotherapies are effective at killing cancer cells because cancer cells generally grow more rapidly than normal cells. However, chemotherapies also target fast-growing normal cells of the body, such as blood cells, hair follicles, and the cells lining the mouth, stomach, and intestines. As a result, they have a range of side effects and although the treatments may succeed at initially decreasing tumor burden, they ultimately fail to kill all the cancer cells and/or to effectively disrupt the tumor microenvironment , potentially resulting in eventual disease progression.
Accordingly, cancer remains one of the world’s most serious health problems and is the second most common cause of death in the United States after heart disease. For example, the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (“NCI”; “SEER”) reported that in 2022 there were approximately 19,880 new cases of ovarian cancer, 236,740 new cases of lung cancer, 151,030 new cases of colorectal cancer and 62,210 new cases of pancreatic cancer in the United States.
With the application of new technologies and key discoveries, we believe that we are now entering an era of cancer research characterized by a more sophisticated understanding of the biology of cancer. We believe that the potential of oral, targeted therapies, along with the rapidly advancing field of immunotherapy, or using the body’s immune system to fight cancer, present the opportunity to develop more effective cancer treatments.
We leverage our expertise in translational research and deep understanding of cancer treatment pathways as well as strategic partnerships to identify, develop and deliver effective options to address unmet needs. We believe the best way for us to help patients living with cancer is by advancing newly emerging mechanisms of the disease and developing novel therapies that target these mechanisms.
Despite significant advances in the treatment of cancer, unmet needs persist. KRAS has long been one of the most elusive cancer-causing proteins. KRAS mutant tumors are present in about 30% of all human cancers, have historically presented a difficult treatment challenge, and are often associated with significantly worse prognosis. Since the discovery of KRAS almost four decades ago, researchers have persistently tried, and failed, to develop therapies that effectively block the cancer-promoting effects of KRAS mutation. Challenges associated with identifying new treatment options for these types of cancers include resistance to single agents, identifying tolerable combination regimens with MEK inhibitors, and new KRAS inhibitors in development addressing only a minority of all KRAS mutated cancers.
Our focus is targeting cancer cells both directly and indirectly by way of the tumor microenvironment.
Low Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer (“LGSOC”)
LGSOC is a slow-growing cancer with a high mortality rate. It is estimated that approximately 70% of LGSOC tumors are driven by mutations in MAPK pathway-associated genes, with approximately 30% of patients harboring KRAS mutations and an additional approximately 40% of patients harboring mutations in other MAPK pathway associated genes. There are an estimated 6,000 patients in the United States and 80,000 worldwide living with this disease. Approximately half of those diagnosed are in their 20s-40s. LGSOC has a median survival rate of 10 years, with 85% of patients experiencing recurrence and enduring severe pain and complications as the disease progresses. Despite low response rates, chemotherapy continues to be the standard of care for this disease. Most prior research has focused on high grade serous ovarian cancer (“HGSOC”). However, LGSOC is clinically, histologically and molecularly unique from HGSOC with limited treatments available.

Currently, avutometinib is being evaluated in combination with defactinib for the treatment of patients with recurrent LGSOC (i) in a Phase 2 registration directed study entitled RAMP 201, and (ii) in the IST entitled FRAME. Avutometinib is also being investigated in combination with defactinib in ISTs to assess efficacy in other gynecological cancers with MAPK pathway mutations (e.g. high-grade and mucinous ovarian cancers, endometrial and cervical cancers).



Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (“NSCLC”)
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States and worldwide. Approximately 15% of lung cancers are small cell lung cancer, approximately 55% are adenocarcinomas, approximately 20% are squamous carcinomas, and about 5% are large cell carcinomas with the remainder being mixed or rare histologies. Approximately 80-85% of lung cancers are NSCLCs, comprising of adenocarcinomas, squamous carcinomas, and large cell carcinomas. Adenocarcinomas most frequently (>50%) have molecular alterations that can be targeted with oral therapies. The most frequent molecular alterations are mutations in the KRAS gene (about 25% of adenocarcinomas) of which KRAS G12C is most common (14%) and G12V second most frequent (7%). Several tyrosine kinase inhibitors are in development for patients with KRAS G12C NSCLC of which the KRAS G12C inhibitors LUMAKRAS (sotorasib) and KRAZATI (adagrasib) are currently approved. LUMAKRAS and KRAZATI have relatively low response rates and short times to progression and thus, number of agents are being combined with the G12C inhibitors including avutometinib in RAMP 203 and RAMP 204, respectively. Currently, avutometinib is being evaluated (i) in combination with Amgen’s KRAS-G12C inhibitor LUMAKRAS (sotorasib) in a Phase 1/2 trial in patients with KRAS G12C mutant NSCLC entitled RAMP 203, (ii) in combination with Mirati’s KRAZATI (adagrasib) in patients with KRAS G12C mutant NSCLC in a Phase 1/2 trial entitled RAMP 204, and (iii) in combination with everolimus for treatment of patients with NSCLC in an IST.
BRAF mutations, including BRAF class II and class III non-V600E, also occur in NSCLC. Whereas BRAF inhibitors in combination with MEK inhibitors are currently approved for BRAF V600E NSCLC, no targeted therapies are approved for BRAF non-V600E NSCLC. Currently, the combination of avutometinib and defactinib is being evaluated for treatment of patients with BRAF mutant NSCLC including a non-V600E cohort in RAMP 202.
Colorectal Cancer (“CRC”)
CRC, also known as bowel cancer, colon cancer, or rectal cancer, is the development of cancer from the colon or rectum (parts of the large intestine). One in 23 men and one in 25 women will be diagnosed with CRC in their lifetime. CRC is the second leading cause of cancer death among people in the United States. The NCI estimates that the number of new incidences of CRC was 37.7 per 100,000 men and women per year based on 2015-2019 cases and the five-year relative survival rate from 2012 to 2018 for patients with CRC was approximately 65%. The individual likelihood of survival depends on how advanced the cancer is, whether or not all the cancer can be removed with surgery, and the person's overall health. 
Treatments used for colorectal cancer may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Cancers that are confined within the wall of the colon may be curable with surgery, while cancer that has spread widely is usually not curable, with management being directed towards improving quality of life and symptoms. KRAS mutations are present in approximately 45% of CRC and predict lack of response to anti-EGFR antibodies such as cetuximab. Although clinical trials of the KRAS G12C inhibitors LUMAKRAS (sotorasib) and KRAZATI (adagrasib) in combination with anti-EGFR antibodies in KRAS G12C CRC have shown promising activity, KRAS G12C only occurs in 3% of CRCs. Thus, novel therapies are needed for patients with CRC harboring other KRAS mutations including KRAS G12D and KRAS G12V which represent 11% and 9%, respectively. It has been shown that simultaneous targeting of multiple nodes in the MAPK pathway may be necessary for deep and durable response, supporting the clinical evaluation of avutometinib in combination with anti-EGFR for patients with KRAS mutant CRC. Currently, avutometinib in combination with the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab is being evaluated for the treatment of patients with advanced KRAS mutant CRC in an IST.

Pancreatic Cancer
In 2022, the NCI estimated that pancreatic cancer was the tenth most common cancer diagnosed in the United States and that the disease represented the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the country. Pancreatic cancer often has a poor prognosis, even when diagnosed early. Pancreatic cancer typically spreads rapidly and is seldom detected in its early stages, which is a major reason why it is a leading cause of cancer death. Signs and symptoms may not appear until pancreatic cancer is so advanced that complete surgical removal is not possible. Pancreatic cancer is one of the few cancers where survival has not improved significantly during the past 40 years. The NCI estimates that the number of new incidences of pancreatic cancer was 13.3 per 100,000 people per year based on 2015-2019 cases. Pancreatic cancer has a very high mortality rate with approximately 88% of patients dying within five years of their initial diagnosis based on the five-year relative survival rate from 2012 to 2018. The median age for diagnosis is 70 with the disease affecting males slightly more than females.
The prognosis for pancreatic cancer is extremely poor as shown by the survival rate, which indicates the need for new treatments. Chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus radiation is offered to patients whose tumors are unable to be removed surgically. Immuno-oncology agents have not demonstrated a significant improvement in treatment outcome for patients with pancreatic cancer. The limited impact of chemotherapies and immunotherapies to improve the outcome may be due to the dense stroma that is prevalent in pancreatic tumors and the tumor microenvironment. Activating mutations in KRAS represent a key initiating event in pancreatic cancer. KRAS mutations occur in up to 98% of pancreatic cancer, with KRAS G12D, G12V and G12R occurring in approximately 28%, 19% and 14% of patients, respectively. Furthermore, pancreatic cancer typically presents with high stromal density, comprised of fibroblasts and dense extracellular matrix, which is thought to limit the penetration of cytotoxic drugs and T cells into pancreatic tumors. Thus, there is a strong scientific rationale for combining avutometinib (to target mutant KRAS) and defactinib (to reduce stromal density and adaptive resistance to avutometinib) to the standard GEMZAR/ABRAXANE regimen with the objective of increasing response rate and survival. Currently, avutometinib is being evaluated in combination with defactinib + gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel for the treatment of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer in a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial entitled RAMP 205. 
Melanoma
In 2022, the NCI estimated melanoma cancer was diagnosed in approximately 99,780 patients or 21.5 cases per 100,000 people based on 2015-2019 cases. The NCI estimates the five year survival rate from 2012-2018 was approximately 94% Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that develops in melanocytes. Melanocytes are in the deep layer of the epidermis between the layer of basal cells. Melanocytes make a pigment called melanin. This gives skin its natural color. The pigment helps to protect the body from ultraviolet light (UV radiation) from the sun. Melanoma is most common at body sites that have received intense, intermittent sun/UV exposure. Melanoma is dangerous and aggressive due to its ability to spread to other organs rapidly if it is not treated at an early stage. About 30% of melanomas begin in existing moles, but the rest start in normal skin. 
The five types of standard treatment for melanoma are surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy. In patients with melanoma, mutations in the MAPK pathway occur mainly in BRAF (41%), NRAS (27%), NF1 (25%) and RAF1 (CRAF) (2.6%). Although several selective BRAF inhibitors are FDA-approved alone or in combination with MEK inhibitors for melanomas with BRAF V600E/K, there is still a need for agents to improve response rate, duration of response, and tolerability. Furthermore, there are no targeted therapy options for patients with BRAF V600E melanoma following progression on BRAF + MEK inhibitor combination and immune checkpoint inhibitors. This provides rationale for the planned IST which will evaluate avutometinib in combination with the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab for patients with BRAF V600E melanoma. 
OUR STRATEGY
With the combination of avutometinib and defactinib, we seek to utilize a multi-faceted approach to treat cancer by directly targeting the cancer cells, enhancing anti-tumor immunity, modulating the local tumor microenvironment, and overcoming mechanisms of adaptive resistance to MAPK pathway inhibition. Our goal is to

build a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel drugs that use a multi-faceted approach to improving outcomes for patients with cancer. 
Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are:

● | Establishing avutometinib as the backbone of therapy for MAPK pathway-driven tumors.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Assessing synergy of avutometinib with other agents in preclinical models to prioritize for clinical development. It is becoming well established that blockade of multiple nodes in the MAPK pathway is necessary for maximal depth and duration of anti-tumor response. We are assessing combinations of avutometinib with (i) agents targeting other nodes in the MAPK pathway (e.g. KRAS G12C, KRAS G12D, anti-EGFR and SOS1 inhibitors), (ii) agents targeting parallel pathways that may mediate resistance to MAPK pathway inhibition (e.g. mTOR and CDK4/6 inhibitors), (iii) chemotherapy, and (iv) anti-PD-1. These studies may lead to discussions with other companies and clinical investigators with the objective of assessing high priority combinations in the clinic.

● | Continuing to develop and explore avutometinib in combination with defactinib and execute on the registration-directed study RAMP 201. The combination of avutometinib with defactinib has been selected vs. avutometinib monotherapy as the go-forward treatment for all recurrent LGSOC regardless of KRAS status, acknowledging the demonstrated contribution of defactinib. Avutometinib is also being investigated in combination with defactinib in ISTs to assess efficacy in other gynecological cancers (e.g. high-grade and mucinous ovarian cancers, endometrial and cervical cancers) with MAPK pathway mutations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expanding the indications in which avutometinib may be used alone and in combination with other agents. We have entered into clinical collaboration agreements with both Amgen and Mirati to evaluate avutometinib in patients with KRAS G12C NSCLC in combination with Amgen’s G12C inhibitor LUMAKRAS (sotorasib) in a trial entitled RAMP 203 or in combination with Mirati’s G12C inhibitor KRAZATI (adagrasib) in a trial entitled RAMP 204. Avutometinib is also being investigated in combination with defactinib + GEMZAR/ABRAXANE in patients with frontline pancreatic cancer in a trial entitled RAMP 205. Additionally, ISTs and preclinical studies are in progress to prioritize additional cancer indications and approaches to expand the potential clinical development of our product candidates. Avutometinib is being investigated in combination with the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab in KRAS mutant CRC and in combination with the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab in BRAF V600E melanoma through ISTs.

Avutometinib and defactinib
Avutometinib is an investigational oral first-in-class unique small molecule RAF/MEK clamp. In contrast to other MEK inhibitors commercially available and in development, avutometinib is a dual RAF/MEK clamp that blocks MEK kinase activity and induces the formation of dominant negative RAF-MEK complexes preventing phosphorylation of MEK by ARAF, BRAF and CRAF. MEK-only inhibitors (e.g., PD0325901) paradoxically induce MEK phosphorylation (“pMEK”) by relieving extracellular-signal-regulated-kinase (ERK)-dependent feedback inhibition of RAF which may limit their efficacy. By inhibiting RAF-mediated phosphorylation of MEK, avutometinib has the advantage of not inducing pMEK. This unique mechanism of avutometinib enables more effective inhibition of ERK signaling and may confer enhanced therapeutic activity against MAPK pathway-driven cancers.

Defactinib is an oral small molecule inhibitor of FAK and PYK2 that is currently being evaluated as a potential combination therapy for various solid tumors. FAK is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by PTK-2 gene that is involved in cellular adhesion and, in cancer, metastatic capability. Defactinib targets malignant cells both directly and through modulation of the tumor microenvironment. Defactinib has received orphan drug designation in ovarian cancer in the United States, European Union, and Australia. Preclinical research by our scientists and collaborators at world-renowned research institutions has described the effect of FAK inhibition to enhance immune response by decreasing immuno-suppressive cells, increasing cytotoxic T cells, and reducing stromal density, which allows tumor-killing immune cells to enter the tumor. Furthermore, it has been shown that FAK activation in response to MAPK inhibitor therapy may bypass MAPK pathway blockade by driving tumor growth through activation of downstream pathways such as RhoA and YAP, supporting the clinical evaluation of avutometinib in combination with defactinib for treatment of cancers harboring MAPK alterations.
The combination of avutometinib and defactinib has received breakthrough designation from the FDA for the treatment of all patients with recurrent LGSOC, regardless of KRAS status after one or more prior lines of therapy, including platinum-based chemotherapy.
Avutometinib and defactinib are clinically active against MAPK pathway-driven cancers.
Phase 1/2 Study (FRAME) Investigating the Combination of avutometinib and Defactinib in Patients with KRAS Mutant Cancers and Subsequent Analyses
The FRAME study is an open-label, investigator-initiated study that is designed to assess safety, dose response and preliminary efficacy of the avutometinib/defactinib combination in patients with KRAS mutant solid tumors, including LGSOC (including KRAS mutant and KRAS wild type), KRAS mutant NSCLC, KRAS G12V NSCLC, KRAS mutant CRC, pancreatic cancer, and RAS/RAF mutant endometrial cancer. The FRAME study is being led by Dr. Udai Banerji and is being conducted in the United Kingdom. In this study, avutometinib was administered using a twice-weekly dose escalation schedule and was administered three out of every four weeks. Defactinib was administered using a twice-daily dose escalation schedule, also three out of every four weeks. Dose levels were assessed in three cohorts: cohort 1 (avutometinib 3.2mg, defactinib 200mg); cohort 2a (avutometinib 4mg, defactinib 200mg); and cohort 2b (avutometinib 3.2mg, defactinib 400mg). The recommended Phase 2 dose was determined to be avutometinib 3.2mg, defactinib 200mg.
Updated Phase 1/2 FRAME Study Results in Patients with LGSOC (September 2021)
At the September 2021 European Society of Medical Oncology Congress, updated data from the LGSOC cohort of the ongoing, investigatory sponsored Phase 1/2 FRAME study were presented. The results showed encouraging response rates and progression-free survival (“PFS”).
Among the evaluable patients with LGSOC (n=24), the ORR was 46% (11 of 24). Among the patients with KRAS mutant LGSOC (n=11), the ORR was 64% (7 of 11). Among the patients with KRAS wild type LGSOC (n=9), the ORR was 44% (4 of 9). Of the evaluable patients, 10 (42%) received previous MEK inhibitor therapy.
The estimated median PFS (“mPFS”) across all patients was 23.0 months (95% CI: 10.6- not reached). As of the April 2021 data cutoff date, 13 of 24 patients (54%) remained on study.
In the FRAME study, the most common Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events were creatine kinase elevation (12%), rash (8%), diarrhea (4%), mouth ulcer/mucositis/glossitis (4%), and hyperbilirubinemia (4%), with only one discontinuation due to adverse events as of the data cutoff.
This data suggests that the novel, intermittent dosing schedule used in the FRAME study continues to show encouraging clinical activity in patients with recurrent LGSOC, including in patients previously treated with a MEK inhibitor.

Phase 2 study (known as RAMP (RAF and MEK Program) 201 Study) Registration-Directed Trial of avutometinib and defactinib in Recurrent LGSOC
The RAMP 201 Study that was initiated in November 2020 is a registration-directed clinical trial of avutometinib and defactinib in patients with recurrent LGSOC. 
The RAMP 201 Study is an adaptive two-part multicenter, parallel cohort, randomized, open label trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of avutometinib alone and in combination with defactinib in patients with recurrent LGSOC. The objective of Part A (selection phase) of the RAMP 201 study was to select the go-forward regimen between avutometinib monotherapy or the combination of avutometinib and defactinib to be studied in Part B (expansion phase). In addition, the efficacy was assessed in both KRAS mutant and KRAS wild type LGSOC. Part B (expansion phase) of the study will examine efficacy and safety parameters of the regimen selected. Part A randomized eligible patients to avutometinib monotherapy (n=33) or the combination of avutometinib and defactinib (n=31). The combination of avutometinib and defactinib has been declared the go-forward treatment regimen based on a higher rate of confirmed objective responses in a planned interim analysis with prespecified criteria.
Updated Phase 2 RAMP 201 Study Results in Patients with LGSOC (January 2023)
Overall, patients on the combination arm were heavily pretreated with an average of four prior systemic regimens (up to 11), including prior platinum-based chemotherapy, endocrine therapy and bevacizumab in most patients and prior MEK inhibitor therapy in about 20% of patients.
Of the 29 patients evaluable for response by BICR in the combination arm, the initial results showed a confirmed objective response rate (ORR) of 28% in all patients and 27% vs 29% in KRAS mutant (n=15) and KRAS wild-type (n=14) LGSOC, respectively. Three additional patients with KRAS mutant LGSOC showed an unconfirmed partial response. In addition, the vast majority of patients showed tumor regression, as the overall disease control rate (stable disease plus partial response) was 93%. Most evaluable patients (62%) were still on study treatment on the combination arm at the time of the data cut with a minimum follow-up of five months.
The confirmed ORR for the monotherapy arm by BICR was 7% in evaluable patients (n=30). The overall disease control rate for the monotherapy arm by BICR was 90%.
Across both the combination and monotherapy arms, there have been no additional safety signals reported with a continued favorable safety and tolerability profile. The most common treatment-related adverse events for the combination in all treated patients were diarrhea, nausea, blood creatine phosphokinase (“CPK”) increased, vision blurred, dermatitis acneiform and rash, fatigue and peripheral edema, most of which were mild to moderate, with 9% discontinuation due to adverse events.
We intend to include mature data from RAMP 201 study and the FRAME study to potentially support filing for accelerated approval. We will continue future enrollment of RAMP 201 in the combination arm only to expand on the clinical experience in anticipation of a confirmatory study. Target enrollment for the combination arm has been achieved. We are in ongoing discussions with the FDA on the confirmatory study and plan to provide an update after agreement with the FDA. We are planning a RAMP 201 presentation at a scientific medical conference in 2023.

Phase 2 Study (known as RAMP (RAF and MEK Program) 202 Study) Registration-Directed Trial of avutometinib and defactinib in Previously Treated KRAS Mutant NSCLC
The RAMP 202 Study that was initiated in December 2020 is a registration-directed clinical trial of avutometinib and defactinib, in patients with KRAS G12V NSCLC. Additionally, and based on preclinical data, we added several exploratory cohorts to the RAMP 202 study including KRAS non-G12V NSCLC and BRAF mutant (V600E and non-V600E) NSCLC.
The RAMP 202 study is a Phase 2, adaptive two-part multicenter, parallel cohort, randomized, open-label trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of avutometinib alone and in combination with defactinib in patients with 

13




KRAS and BRAF mutant NSCLC, following treatment with a platinum-based regimen and immune checkpoint inhibitor. The first part of the study will determine the optimal regimen of either avutometinib monotherapy or in combination with defactinib in patients with KRAS G12V NSCLC. The second phase of the study (expansion phase) will examine efficacy and safety parameters of the most effective regimen in patients with KRAS G12V NSCLC.
In October 2022, we reported data from a planned interim analysis of Part A from the RAMP 202 trial among patients with KRAS G12V NSCLC treated with avutometinib or the combination of avutometinib and defactinib. While active, the results did not meet the pre-defined criteria to continue to the trial expansion phase. Also among patients with KRAS non G12V NSCLC, no KRAS subtype was identified for further clinical evaluation of avutometinib with defactinib in this trial. We plan to present the Part A results of RAMP 202 at an upcoming medical congress.
Phase 1/2 Trial (known as RAMP (RAF and MEK Program) 203 Study) of avutometinib in Combination with Amgen’s LUMAKRAS (sotorasib) in Patients with KRAS G12C NSCLC
In September 2021, we entered into a clinical collaboration agreement with Amgen to evaluate the combination of avutometinib with Amgen’s KRAS G12C inhibitor LUMAKRAS (sotorasib) in a Phase 1/2 trial entitled RAMP 203. The Phase 1/2 trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of avutometinib in combination with LUMAKRAS in patients with KRAS G12C NSCLC who have not been previously treated with a KRAS G12C inhibitor as well as in patients who have progressed on a KRAS G12C inhibitor. The study will investigate the potential benefits of a more complete vertical blockade of the MAPK pathway with the combination of avutometinib (RAF/MEK inhibition) with LUMAKRAS (KRAS G12C inhibition) in KRAS G12C locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. The RAMP 203 trial has advanced to cohort 2 of 4 mg avutometinib in combination with 960 mg of LUMAKRAS.
Phase 1/2 Trial (known as RAMP (RAF and MEK Program) 204 Study) of avutometinib in Combination with Mirati’s KRAZATI (adagrasib) in Patients with KRAS G12C NSCLC
In November 2021, we entered into a clinical collaboration agreement to evaluate the combination of avutometinib with Mirati’s KRAS G12C inhibitor KRAZATI (adagrasib) in a Phase 1/2 trial entitled RAMP 204. The Phase 1/2 trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of avutometinib in combination with KRAZATI in patients who have progressed on a KRAS G12C inhibitor. The trial will build on preclinical data showing deeper blockade of MAPK pathway signaling resulting in enhanced anti-tumor efficacy with the combination of KRAZATI (KRAS G12C inhibition) and avutometinib (RAF/MEK inhibition) relative to either agent alone. The RAMP 204 trial is open and enrolling.
Phase 1/2 Trial (known as RAMP (RAF and MEK Program) 205 Study) of avutometinib + defactinib + gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel 
In May 2022, we received the first “Therapeutic Accelerator Award” from PanCAN for up to $3.8 million. The grant is expected to support a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of avutometinib in combination with defactinib entitled RAMP 205. This Phase 1b/2 trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of GEMZAR (gemcitabine) and ABRAXANE (Nab-paclitaxel) in combination with avutometinib and defactinib in patients with previously untreated metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. The RAMP 205 trial will evaluate whether combining avutometinib (to target mutant KRAS which is mutated in more than 90% of pancreatic tumors) and defactinib (to reduce stromal density and adaptive resistance to avutometinib) to the standard GEMZAR/ABRAXANE regimen improves outcomes for patients with pancreatic cancer. We opened the RAMP 205 trial in the fourth quarter of 2022.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our product candidates and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, and any other aspects of inventions that are commercially important to the 

14




development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to compositions, methods of treatment and patient selection created or identified from our ongoing development of our product candidates. Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We seek to obtain domestic and international patent protection, and endeavor to promptly file patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions.
The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and patent scope can be reinterpreted by the courts after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient protection from competitors.
Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially even longer, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings or derivation proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention.
Patents
Our patent portfolio includes issued and pending applications worldwide. These patent applications fall into two categories: (1) RAF/MEK inhibition program; and (2) FAK inhibition program.
RAF/MEK inhibition program
We have exclusively licensed a portfolio of four patent families owned by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Chugai”). The first patent family has claims directed to the composition of matter of avutometinib, and includes granted patents in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Japan, Korea, Israel, and New Zealand that are expected to expire in February of 2027. The second patent family has claims directed to methods of making avutometinib and includes granted patents in Europe, Japan, and the United States that are expected to expire in September of 2032. The third patent family has claims directed to a dosing protocol of avutometinib, and includes a granted patent in the United States that is expected to expire in November of 2038 and pending patent applications in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Singapore, Taiwan, and Russia. Patents that issue in this family will have a statutory expiration date in May of 2038. The fourth patent family covers a method of using avutometinib in combination with a FAK inhibitor, such as defactinib, for treating a patient, and includes a granted patent in the United States that is expected to expire in September of 2040 and pending patent applications in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Eurasia, Europe, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, the United States, and Taiwan.
In addition to the issued and pending patent applications exclusively licensed from Chugai, we own eleven patent families covering methods of using a dual RAF/MEK inhibitor for treating a patient. The first and second patent families cover methods of using a dual RAF/MEK inhibitor in combination with a KRAS G12C inhibitor or an immunotherapeutic agent for treating a patient, and are pending in the United States and worldwide. The third patent family covers a method of using a dual RAF/MEK inhibitor to treat a patient with certain mutations, and is pending in the United States and worldwide. The fourth patent family covers solid forms of avutometinib, and is pending in the United States as a nonprovisional patent application. We also have six patent families covering methods of using a dual RAF/MEK inhibitor in combination with another therapeutic agent for treating a patient, 

15




which are pending as international applications. Any U.S. patents that will issue in the ten families will have a statutory expiration date ranging from January of 2041 to January of 2043. We also have one patent family covering methods of using a MEK inhibitor to treat certain populations of patients, which is pending as a provisional patent application in the United States. 
FAK inhibition program
We have exclusively licensed a portfolio of patent applications owned by Pfizer, Inc. (“Pfizer”), which are directed to FAK inhibitor compounds and methods of their use, for example in cancer. One patent family is related generally to defactinib. This patent family includes issued patents having claims covering defactinib generically and specifically. For example, US 7,928,109 covers the composition of matter of defactinib specifically, and US 8,247,411 covers the composition of matter of defactinib generically. Also included are issued and pending patent applications having claims directed to methods of treatment and methods of making defactinib. For example, US 8,440,822 and US 10,450,297 cover methods of making defactinib. Any U.S. patents that have issued or will issue in this family will have a statutory expiration date in April of 2028. Related cases are pending worldwide, including in Thailand, and granted in Australia, Europe, Brazil, Mexico, India, Hong Kong, Canada, China, Korea, Israel, New Zealand, South Africa, Singapore, Taiwan, and Japan.
In addition to the issued and pending patent applications exclusively licensed from Pfizer, we own three patent families covering defactinib. One family is directed to compositions (e.g., oral dosage forms) of defactinib and certain methods of use. Any U.S. patents that will issue in this family will have a statutory expiration date in January of 2035. Patent applications in this family are pending worldwide, including in the United States, Thailand, Brazil, and China, and granted in Australia, Canada, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Mexico, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Africa. The second family is directed to methods of using a FAK inhibitor, such as defactinib, in combination with a MEK inhibitor for treating a patient. Any U.S. patents that will issue in this family will have a statutory expiration date in February of 2035. Patent applications in this family are pending worldwide, including for example in Japan, and granted in the United States, Hong Kong, and Europe. The third family is directed to methods of using a FAK inhibitor, such as defactinib, in combination with an immunotherapeutic agent. Any U.S. patents that have issued or will issue in this family will have a statutory expiration date in June of 2036. Patent applications in this family are pending worldwide, including for example in Europe, New Zealand, Brazil, Korea, Israel, Canada, Japan, and Hong Kong, and granted in the United States, Australia, China, Eurasia, Mexico, Singapore, and South Africa.
Our licensed portfolio of patent applications from Pfizer also includes four families of patent applications directed to VS-6062 and related methods of use. The patent families include issued and pending patent applications having claims directed to VS-6062, methods of manufacture, and pharmaceutical salts. Patents have issued in these families in the United States that will expire in December of 2023, April of 2025, and November of 2028, respectively. Related cases have been granted worldwide, including in Australia, Canada, China, Japan, and Europe. Stanford University has an option to certain United States rights in VS-6062.
Patent Term
The base term of a U.S. patent is 20 years from the filing date of the earliest-filed non-provisional patent application from which the patent claims priority. The term of a U.S. patent can be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates the owner of the patent for administrative delays at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. In some cases, the term of a U.S. patent is shortened by terminal disclaimer that reduces its term to that of an earlier-expiring patent.
The term of a United States patent may be eligible for patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, to account for at least some of the time the drug is under development and regulatory review after the patent is granted. With regard to a drug for which FDA approval is the first permitted marketing of the active ingredient, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows for extension of the term of one United States patent that includes at least one claim covering the composition of matter of an FDA-approved drug, an FDA-approved method of treatment using the drug, and/or a method of manufacturing the FDA-approved drug. The extended patent term cannot exceed the shorter of five years beyond the non-extended expiration of the patent or 14 years from the date of the FDA approval of the drug. Some foreign 

16




jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan, have analogous patent term extension provisions, which allow for extension of the term of a patent that covers a drug approved by the applicable foreign regulatory agency.
LICENSES AND COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS
Secura 
On August 10, 2020, we and Secura Bio, Inc. (“Secura”) signed an Asset Purchase Agreement (“Secura APA”) and on September 30, 2020, the transaction closed.
Pursuant to the Secura APA, we sold to Secura our exclusive worldwide license for the research, development, commercialization, and manufacture in oncology indications of products containing duvelisib. The sale included certain intellectual property related to duvelisib in oncology indications, certain existing duvelisib inventory, claims and rights under certain contracts pertaining to duvelisib. Pursuant to the Secura APA, Secura assumed all operational and financial responsibility for activities that were part of the duvelisib oncology program, including all commercialization efforts related to duvelisib in the United States and Europe, as well as our ongoing duvelisib clinical trials. Further, Secura assumed all obligations with existing collaboration partners developing and commercializing duvelisib, which include Yakult Honsha Co., Ltd. (“Yakult”), CSPC Pharmaceutical Group Limited (“CSPC”), and Sanofi. Additionally, Secura assumed all royalty payment obligations due under the amended and restated license agreement with Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Infinity”).
Pursuant to the terms of the Secura APA, Secura has paid us an up-front payment of $70.0 million, and has agreed to pay us (i) regulatory milestone payments up to $45.0 million, consisting of a payment of $35.0 million upon receipt of regulatory approval of COPIKTRA in the United States for the treatment of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (“PTCL”) and a payment of $10.0 million upon receipt of the first regulatory approval for the commercial sale of COPIKTRA in the European Union for the treatment of PTCL, (ii) sales milestone payments of up to $50.0 million, consisting of $10.0 million when total worldwide net sales of COPIKTRA exceed $100.0 million, $15.0 million when total worldwide net sales of COPIKTRA exceed $200.0 million and $25.0 million when total worldwide net sales of COPIKTRA exceed $300.0 million, (iii) low double-digit royalties on the annual aggregate net sales above $100.0 million in the United States, European Union, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and (iv) 50% of all royalty, milestone and sublicense revenue payments payable to Secura under our existing license agreements with Sanofi, Yakult, and CSPC, and 50% of all royalty, and royalty payments payable to Secura under any license or sublicense agreement entered into by Secura in certain jurisdictions.
Secura’s royalty obligations remain in effect on a country-by-country basis upon the last to occur (a) 10 years from the first commercial sale of product containing duvelisib in such country or (b) the expiration of all valid patent claims covering products containing duvelisib in such country.
In December 2021, Secura announced it had voluntarily withdrawn COPIKTRA (duvelisib) from the U.S. for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma after at least two prior systemic therapies. On June 30, 2022, the FDA issued a drug safety communication warning that resulted from a clinical trial showing a possible increased risk of death with COPIKTRA compared to another medicine to treat chronic blood cancer called leukemia and lymphoma. The clinical trial also found that COPIKTRA was associated with a higher risk of serious side effects, including infections, diarrhea, inflammation of the intestines and lungs, skin reactions, and high liver enzyme levels in the blood. In September 2022, the FDA’s Oncologic Drug Advisory Committee (“ODAC”) voted eight to four against COPIKTRA’s use in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/ small lymphocytic lymphoma after at least two prior therapies citing an unfavorable risk/benefit profile. In September 2022, Secura’s sublicensee, Yakult, announced it had withdrawn its NDA for duvelisib in Japan.
Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
On January 7, 2020, we entered into a license agreement with Chugai (the “Chugai Agreement”) whereby Chugai granted us an exclusive worldwide license for the development, commercialization, and manufacture of products containing avutometinib.

17




Under the terms of the Chugai Agreement, we received an exclusive right to develop and commercialize products containing avutometinib at our own cost and expense. In February 2020, we paid Chugai a non-refundable payment of $3.0 million. We are further obligated to pay Chugai double-digit royalties on net sales of products containing avutometinib, subject to reduction in certain circumstances. Chugai also obtained opt back rights to develop and commercialize avutometinib (a) in the European Union, which option may be exercised through the date we submit a New Drug Application (“NDA”) to the FDA for a product which contains avutometinib as the sole active pharmaceutical ingredient and (b) in Japan and Taiwan, which option may be exercised through the date we receive marketing authorization from the FDA for a product which contains avutometinib as the sole active pharmaceutical ingredient. As consideration for executing either option, Chugai would have to make a payment to us calculated on our development costs to date. Chugai has communicated their intention not to exercise their opt back rights for Japan, Taiwan, or the European Union. Chugai and we have made customary representations and warranties and have agreed to certain customary covenants, including confidentiality and indemnification.
Unless earlier terminated, the Chugai Agreement will expire upon the fulfillment of our royalty obligations to Chugai for the sale of any products containing the avutometinib, which royalty obligations expire on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, upon the last to occur, in each specific country, of (a) expiration of valid patent claims covering such product or (b) 12 years from the first commercial sale of such product in such country. 
We may terminate the Chugai Agreement upon 180 days’ written notice. Subject to certain limitations, Chugai may terminate the Chugai Agreement upon written notice if we challenge any patent licensed by Chugai to us under the Chugai Agreement. Either party may terminate the license agreement in its entirety with 120 days’ written notice for the other party’s material breach if such party fails to cure the breach. Either party may also terminate the Chugai Agreement in its entirety upon certain insolvency events involving the other party.
Pfizer Inc.
On July 11, 2012, we entered into a license agreement (the “Pfizer Agreement”) with Pfizer under which Pfizer granted us worldwide, exclusive rights to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize products containing certain of Pfizer’s inhibitors of FAK, including defactinib, for all therapeutic, diagnostic and prophylactic uses in humans. We have the right to grant sublicenses under the foregoing licensed rights, subject to certain restrictions. We are solely responsible, at our own expense, for the clinical development of these products, which is to be conducted in accordance with an agreed-upon development plan. We are also responsible for all manufacturing and commercialization activities at our own expense. Pfizer provided us with an initial quantity of clinical supplies of one of the products for an agreed upon price.
Upon entering into the Pfizer Agreement, we made a one-time cash payment to Pfizer in the amount of $1.5 million and issued 192,012 shares of our common stock. Pfizer is also eligible to receive up to $2.0 million in developmental milestones and up to an additional $125.0 million based on the successful attainment of regulatory and commercial sales milestones. Pfizer is also eligible to receive high single to mid-double-digit royalties on future net sales of the products. Our royalty obligations with respect to each product in each country begin on the date of first commercial sale of the product in that country, and end on the later of 10 years after the date of first commercial sale of the product in that country or the date of expiration or abandonment of the last claim contained in any issued patent or patent application licensed by Pfizer to us that covers the product in that country.
The Pfizer Agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of all our royalty obligations to Pfizer, determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis. So long as we are not in breach of the Pfizer Agreement, we have the right to terminate the license agreement at will on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, or in its entirety, upon 90 days written notice to Pfizer. Either party has the right to terminate the Pfizer Agreement in connection with an insolvency event involving the other party or a material breach of the Pfizer Agreement by the other party that remains uncured for a specified period of time. If the Pfizer Agreement is terminated by either party for any reason, worldwide rights to the research, development, manufacture and commercialization of the products revert back to Pfizer.

COMPETITION
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of all our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, side effects, convenience, price, the level of generic competition, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient, or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. There are many generic products currently on the market for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our therapeutic product candidates are approved, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products.
The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation, and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy, and targeted drug therapy. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. To the extent our product candidates are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to existing drug or other therapies, our product candidates will not be competitive with them. Some of the currently approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved drugs are well established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. In general, although there has been considerable progress over the past few decades in the treatment of cancer and the currently marketed therapies provide benefits to many patients, these therapies all are limited to some extent in their efficacy and frequency of adverse events, and none of them are successful in treating all patients. As a result, the level of morbidity and mortality from cancer remains high.
In addition to currently marketed therapies, there are also a number of products in late stage clinical development to treat cancer. These products in development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience, and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any of our product candidates for which we obtain market approval.

RAF/MEK inhibition program
There are other companies with approved RAF and/or MEK inhibitors with FDA approval in the market and companies working to develop RAF and/or MEK inhibitor. We believe the following companies have an approved RAF and/or MEK inhibitor:

● | Novartis AG, which has received FDA approval for Taflinar ® (dabrafenib), a RAF inhibitor, in combination with Mekinist ® (trametinib), a MEK inhibitor, for treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations, adjuvant treatment for melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations and involvement of lymph nodes following complete resection, metastatic NSCLC with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations and locally advanced or metastatic anaplastic thyroid cancer with BRAF V600E mutation;

Oncology
In addition to companies that have inhibitors addressing our targets of interest, our competition also includes hundreds of private and publicly traded companies that operate in the area of oncology but have therapeutics with different mechanisms of action. The oncology market in general is highly competitive, with over 1,000 molecules currently in clinical development.
MANUFACTURING
We contract with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical studies and clinical trials, and we intend to continue to do so in the future. We currently work with one contract manufacturing organization (“CMO”) for the manufacture of avutometinib drug product, one CMO for the production of avutometinib drug substance, and one CMO for avutometinib drug packaging/labeling. For defactinib, we currently have one CMO for the manufacture of drug product, one CMO for the production of drug substance, and one CMO for drug packaging /labeling. We have development agreements in place with these CMOs and we obtain drug 

21




substance, drug product and packaging/labeling services from these CMOs on a purchase order basis. We may elect to pursue relationships with other CMOs for manufacturing of drug product, drug substance, and packaging/labeling for later-stage clinical trials, commercialization or for risk management. We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We have personnel with pharmaceutical development and manufacturing experience who are responsible for the relationships with our CMOs.
All of our drug candidates are organic compounds of low molecular weight, generally called small molecules. We select compounds not only on the basis of their potential efficacy and safety, but also for their ease of synthesis and the reasonable cost of their starting materials. We expect to continue to develop drug candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at third-party CMOs.

APPLICABLE LAWS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, import and export of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing.
United States drug approval process
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice (“GLP”) regulations and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable requirements;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug (“IND”) application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices (“GCP”) and other clinical-trial related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an NDA and payment of user fees for FDA review of NDA;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22





(“cGMP”) requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

Preclinical studies
Before testing any product candidate in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective thirty days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

● | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a 

23




clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a NDA or, in certain circumstances, post-approval.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Marketing approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, scheduled in 2023 to exceed $3.2 million, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual program fees, based on the number of approved products. These fees are typically adjusted annually. User fee statutory authority expires every five years. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act was re-authorized for an additional five years in 2022 until 2027. Fee waivers are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for an orphan drug application.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission before accepting them for filing to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of NDAs. Under these goals, the FDA has committed to review most such applications for non-priority products within 10 months after accepting the application for filing, and most applications for priority review products, that is, drugs that the FDA determines represent a significant improvement over existing therapy, within six months after accepting the application for filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drugs or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended and reauthorized by the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (“FDAAA”), an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan drug designation.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and integrity of the clinical data submitted.
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take many years to complete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be 

24




susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to develop our product candidates and secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products.
After the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If the FDA issues a complete response letter, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval and refuse to approve the NDA.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval, which are designed to expedite or facilitate the process for the development and FDA review of drugs and biologics that are intended for the treatment of serious or life threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs and biologics to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
Fast Track Designation. To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that the product is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition for which there is no effective treatment, and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a fast track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND for the product candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days after receipt of the sponsor’s request.
In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Breakthrough Designation. A drug may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The breakthrough therapy designation provides all the benefits of the fast track program, including the eligibility for rolling review. The FDA may take certain administrative actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process, providing timely advice to the product 

25




sponsor regarding development and approval, involving more senior staff in the review process, assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team and taking other steps to aid sponsors in designing the clinical trials. Although breakthrough designation does not affect the regulatory standards for approval, the frequent interactions with the FDA may facilitate a more efficient development program. In addition, the breakthrough designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification. 
Priority Review. Under FDA policies, a product candidate may be eligible for priority review, or review within a six-month time frame, compared to the ten-month time frame for a standard review, from the time a complete application is accepted for filing. Products regulated by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) are eligible for priority review if they provide a significant improvement compared to marketed products in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease.
Accelerated Approval. Under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of one or more Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. The Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 (“FDORA”) signed by President Biden on December 29, 2022 as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (H.R. 2617) includes numerous reforms to the accelerated approval process for drugs and biologics and enables FDA to require, as appropriate, that a post-approval study be underway prior to granting accelerated approval. FDORA also expands the expedited withdrawal procedures available to FDA to allow the agency to use expedited procedures if a sponsor fails to conduct any required post-approval study of the product with due diligence.” FDORA also adds the failure of a sponsor of a product approved under accelerated approval to conduct with due diligence any required post-approval study with respect to such product or to submit timely reports with respect to such product to the list of prohibited acts in the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
Orphan drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. The FDA has historically taken the position that the scope of orphan exclusivity aligns with the approved indication or use of a product, rather than the disease or condition for which the product received orphan designation. However, on September 30, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit issued a decision in Catalyst Pharms., Inc. v. Becerra holding that the scope of orphan drug exclusivity must align with the disease or condition for which the product received orphan designation, even if the product’s approval was for a narrower use or indication. It remains to be seen how this decision affects orphan drug exclusivity going forward. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.

The Hatch-Waxman Act
Abbreviated New Drug Applications
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). Generally, an ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths, dosage form and route of administration as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent through in vitro or in vivo testing or otherwise to the listed drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:

● | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


● | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the NDA or patent holder’s receipt of the Paragraph IV certification, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
The ANDA also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity period, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, for the referenced product has expired. Federal law provides a period of five years following approval of a drug containing no previously approved active moiety during which ANDAs for generic versions of those drugs cannot be submitted unless the submission contains a Paragraph IV challenge to a listed patent, in which case the submission may be made four years following the original product approval. Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity during which the FDA cannot grant effective approval of an ANDA for the conditions of use covered by the exclusivity, but FDA requires as a condition of approval new clinical trials conducted by or for the sponsor. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, federal law also provides that periods of patent and non-patent marketing exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for a drug may be extended by six months if the NDA sponsor conducts pediatric studies identified by the FDA in a written request. For written requests issued 

27




by the FDA after September 27, 2007, the date of enactment of the FDAAA, the FDA must grant pediatric exclusivity no later than nine months prior to the date of expiration of patent or non-patent exclusivity in order for the six-month pediatric extension to apply to that exclusivity period.
Combination Therapy 
Combination therapy is a treatment modality that involves the use of two or more drugs to be used in combination to treat a disease or condition. If those drugs are combined in one dosage form, such as one pill, that is known as a fixed dose combination product and it is reviewed pursuant to the FDA’s Combination Rule at 21 CFR 300.50. The Rule provides that two or more drugs may be combined in a single dosage form when each component contributes to the claimed effects and the dosage of each component (amount, frequency, duration) is such that the combination is safe and effective for a significant patient population requiring such concurrent therapy as defined in the labeling for the drug. 
But not all combination therapy falls under the category of a fixed dose combination. For example, the FDA recognizes that two drugs in separate dosage forms and in separate packaging, that otherwise might be administered as monotherapy for an indication, also may be used in combination for the same indication. In 2013, the FDA issued guidance to assist sponsors that were developing the range of combination therapies that fall outside the category of fixed dose combinations. That guidance provides recommendations and advice on such topics as: (1) assessment at the outset whether two or more therapies are appropriate for use in combination; (2) guiding principles for nonclinical and clinical development of the combination; (3) options for regulatory pathways to seek marketing approval of the combination; and (4) post-marketing safety monitoring and reporting obligations. Given the wide range of potential combination therapy variations, the FDA indicated it intends to assess each potential combination on a case-by case basis and encouraged sponsors to engage in early and regular consultation with the relevant review division at the agency throughout the development process for its proposed combination.
Combination products
The FDA regulates combinations of products that cross FDA centers, such as drug, biologic or medical device components that are physically, chemically or otherwise combined into a single entity, as a combination product. The FDA center with primary jurisdiction for the combination product will take the lead in the premarket review of the product, with the other center consulting or collaborating with the lead center.
The FDA’s Office of Combination Products (“OCP”) determines which center will have primary jurisdiction for the combination product based on the combination product’s “primary mode of action.” A mode of action is the means by which a product achieves an intended therapeutic effect or action. The primary mode of action is the mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product, or the mode of action expected to make the greatest contribution to the overall intended therapeutic effects of the combination product.
Often it is difficult for the OCP to determine with reasonable certainty the most important therapeutic action of the combination product. In those difficult cases, the OCP will consider consistency with other combination products raising similar types of safety and effectiveness questions, or which center has the most expertise to evaluate the most significant safety and effectiveness questions raised by the combination product.
A sponsor may use a voluntary formal process, known as a Request for Designation, when the product classification is unclear or in dispute, to obtain a binding decision as to which center will regulate the combination product. If the sponsor objects to that decision, it may request that the agency reconsider that decision.
Other regulatory requirements
Any drug manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals would be subject to extensive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with 

28




the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Regulatory approval of oncology products often requires that patients in clinical trials be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability.
Additional provisions
Physician drug samples
As part of the sales and marketing process, pharmaceutical companies frequently provide samples of approved drugs to physicians. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act (“PDMA”) imposes requirements and limitations upon the provision of drug samples to physicians, as well as prohibits states from licensing distributors of prescription drugs unless the state licensing program meets certain federal guidelines that include minimum standards for storage, handling and record keeping. In addition, the PDMA sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations.

Foreign regulation
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Regardless of our current FDA approval or any future FDA approvals we may obtain for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Pharmaceutical coverage, pricing and reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of new drug products. Sales of product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication.

In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. We may also need to provide discounts to purchasers, private health plans or government healthcare programs. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Even if covered, third party payors may seek to control utilization of our products through various managed care mechanisms (e.g., requiring a prescriber to obtain prior authorization from a health plan before the product will be covered by the health plan or establishing patient copays and deductibles that encourage use of other products over our products). A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to enable us to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular drug product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate.
Within the United States, FDA-approved drugs could potentially be covered by various government health benefit programs as well as purchased by government agencies. The participation in such programs or the sale of products to such agencies is subject to regulation. The marketability of any of our approved products may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. 
Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, participating manufacturers are required to pay a rebate for each unit of product reimbursed by the state Medicaid programs. The amount of the rebate for each product is set by law and may be subject to an additional discount if certain pricing increases more than inflation. 
Medicare is a federal program that is administered by the federal government that covers individuals aged 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities. Oral drugs may be covered under Medicare Part D. Medicare Part D provides coverage to enrolled Medicare patients for self-administered drugs (i.e., drugs that do not need to be injected or otherwise administered by a physician). Medicare Part D is administered by private prescription drug plans approved by the U.S. government and each drug plan establishes its own Medicare Part D formulary for prescription drug coverage and pricing, which the drug plan may modify from time-to-time. The prescription drug plans negotiate pricing with manufacturers and may condition formulary placement on the availability of manufacturer discounts. Under the Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program, manufacturers with marketed brand 

30




name drugs are currently required to provide a 70% discount on the negotiated price for brand name prescription drugs utilized by Medicare Part D beneficiaries when those beneficiaries reach the coverage gap in their drug benefits.
Drug products are subject to discounted pricing when purchased by federal agencies via the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”). FSS participation is required for a drug product to be covered and reimbursed by certain federal agencies and for coverage under Medicaid, Medicare Part B and the Public Health Service (PHS) pharmaceutical pricing program. FSS pricing is negotiated periodically with the Department of Veterans Affairs. FSS pricing is intended not to exceed the price that a manufacturer charges its most-favored non-federal customer for its product. In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the Veterans Administration, Department of Defense (including drugs purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TRICARE retail pharmacy program), Coast Guard, and PHS are subject to a cap on pricing (known as the “federal ceiling price”) and may be subject to an additional discount if pricing increases more than the rate of inflation. 
To maintain coverage of drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, manufacturers are required to extend discounts to certain purchasers under the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program. Purchasers eligible for discounts include hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of financially needy patients, community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS.
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of such controls and measures, and tightening of existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the drug candidates that we are developing and could adversely affect our net revenue and results.
Pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
The marketability of products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and private third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement, seek to control utilization, or create pressure to provide price concessions, coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for a product, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

New legislation and regulations
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in the United States Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing and marketing of 

31




pharmaceutical products. For example, in December 2016, Congress enacted and President Obama signed into law the 21st Century Cures Act that amends a number of sections of the FDCA. Additionally, in December 2022, President Biden signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (H.R. 2617) that contains important reforms relevant to the FDA, including the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 (“FDORA”) and the Prepare for and Respond to Existing Viruses, Emerging New Threats, and Pandemics Act (the “PREVENT Pandemics Act”). In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be.





In the United States, federal and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reform delivery of, or payment for, healthcare, which include initiatives to reduce the cost of healthcare generally and drugs specifically. For example, in March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Healthcare Reform Act, which expanded healthcare coverage through Medicaid expansion and the implementation of the individual mandate for health insurance coverage and which included changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs as well as the imposition of annual fees on manufacturers of branded pharmaceuticals. There have been ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act. For example, tax reform legislation was enacted at the end of 2017 that eliminated the tax penalty for individuals who do not maintain mandated health insurance coverage beginning in 2019. The Healthcare Reform Act has also been subject to judicial challenge. In 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the Healthcare Reform Act brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the Healthcare Reform Act.
Beyond the Healthcare Reform Act, there have been ongoing health care reform efforts. Some recent healthcare reform efforts have sought to address certain issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including an expansion of telehealth coverage under Medicare and accelerated or advanced Medicare payments to healthcare providers. Other reform efforts affect pricing or payment for drug products. Drug pricing and payment reform was a focus of the Trump Administration and has been a focus of the Biden Administration. For example, in 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 contains numerous drug pricing and payment reforms. Among other provisions, the IRA imposes a yearly cap ($2,000 in 2025) on out-of-pocket prescription drug costs in Medicare Part D, implements a new Medicare Part D manufacturer discount drug program in 2025; requires manufacturers to pay a rebate to the federal government if prices for single-source drugs and biologicals covered under Medicare Part B and nearly all covered drugs under Part D increase faster than the rate of inflation and, starting in 2026, creates a drug price negotiation program under which the prices for certain high Medicare spend drugs and biologicals without generic or biosimilar competition will be limited by a cap that is defined by reference to, among other things, a specified non-federal average manufacturer price.
Healthcare reform efforts have been and may continue to be subject to scrutiny and legal challenge. For example, revisions to regulations under the federal anti-kickback statute would remove protection for traditional Medicare Part D discounts offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers and health plans. Pursuant to court order, the removal was delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2032.
Recently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals. There have also been efforts at the federal level to implement measures to regulate drug pricing or payment for pharmaceutical products, including legislation on drug importation. There have also been recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices. As another example, legislation passed in 2019 revised how certain prices reported by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated and legislation enacted in 2021 eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024.
Adoption of new legislation at the federal or state level could affect demand for, or pricing of, our product candidates if approved for sale. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any changes to the Health 

32




Care Reform Act or other federal and state reform efforts. There is no assurance that federal or state healthcare reform will not adversely affect our future business and financial results.
