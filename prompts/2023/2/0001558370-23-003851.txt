ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview
We provide digital infrastructure and communications services in the United States and internationally, including in the Caribbean region, with a focus on smaller markets, many of which are rural or remote, with a growing demand for infrastructure investments, Through our operating subsidiaries, we primarily provide: (i) carrier and enterprise

communications services, such as terrestrial and submarine fiber optic transport, and communications tower facilities; and (ii) fixed and mobile telecommunications connectivity to residential, business and government customers, including a range of high-speed internet and data services, fixed and mobile wireless solutions, and video and voice services.
At the holding company level, we oversee the allocation of capital within and among our subsidiaries, affiliates, new investments, and stockholders. We have developed significant operational expertise and resources that we use to augment the capabilities of our individual operating subsidiaries in our local markets. We have built a platform of resources and expertise to support our operating subsidiaries and to improve their quality of service with greater economies of scale and expertise than would typically be available at the operating subsidiary level. We provide management, technical, financial, regulatory, and marketing services to our operating subsidiaries and typically receive a management fee calculated as a percentage of their revenues, which is eliminated in consolidation. We also actively evaluate potential acquisitions, investment opportunities and other strategic transactions, both domestic and international, and generally look for those that we believe fit our profile of telecommunications businesses and have the potential to complement our “glass and steel” and “first to fiber” approach in markets while generating steady excess cash flows over extended periods of time. We use the cash generated from our operations to re-invest in organic growth in our existing businesses, to make strategic investments in additional businesses, and to return cash to our investors through dividends or stock repurchases.
For further information about our financial segments and geographical information about our operating revenues and assets, see Notes 1 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.

Strategy
Our mission is to digitally empower people and communities so that they can connect with the world and prosper. We believe that access to reliable, high-quality communications services is fundamental to the economic growth and well-being of every community. To that end, we seek to empower the local communities with the services they need to access healthcare, education, and economic opportunities by providing reliable, high speed broadband access through fiber or fiber-like services to business, consumer, and carrier customers. To execute on this mission, our strategy is to be a leading provider of critical network and digital infrastructure services in our current operating region, focusing in particular on historically underbuilt or poorly served areas and segments. The key elements of our strategy consist of the following:
​

● | First to Fiber. We utilize a “first to fiber” smart build strategy targeting underbuilt parts of our operating area and adjacencies to “close the digital divide” in our rural or remote markets. We use a variety of approaches to accomplish this while ensuring a viable return on our investment, including a focus on last-mile investments as well as a glass and steel ownership model where we seek to enable connectivity through owned backhaul and owned towers. In our US Telecom segment, we are connecting new communities and schools utilizing federal, state, local or tribal government funding incentives and programs, or using “anchor

tenant” fiber builds for wireless carrier backhaul or large enterprise customers. In many cases, we rely on several of those subsidy or revenue sources to enable a high quality and sustainable network investment. In our International Telecom segment, in some markets, we are primarily focused on increasing the capacity and capability of our core and edge networks and serving the customer base with a mixture of fixed and mobile high-speed solutions. In others, such as Guyana, we also are rapidly expanding the reach of our fiber and other high speed data solutions as demand and need grows. We believe that every community, regardless of its population size or geographic location, should experience the rich benefit of a quality digital connection. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Target Underbuilt Market Segments. We operate our communications businesses primarily in smaller, often remote or rural, historically under-served markets where we are, or we believe we will be, one of the leading providers of communications services. We seek opportunities to build, manage, and own critical communications infrastructure in areas with high unmet demand for connectivity where we have the potential for generating substantial and steady cash flows over extended periods of time. By supplementing the business with our operational capabilities and experience at the holding company level, we are able to take on unproven markets with more difficult operating or political environments. We strive to improve and expand our product and service offerings in the locations we serve to better satisfy customer needs, expand our customer base and revenues, and ensure the business is efficient and economically viable.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Provide Operational Expertise in Collaboration with Local Management. We believe that strong local management enhances our close relationship with customers and reduces risk. Our businesses typically have strong local brand identities that help them become leaders in the markets they serve. Wherever feasible, we seek to partner with local investors, owners or management teams who have demonstrated a successful track record or have extensive knowledge of the industry or markets in which we operate, and who have local credibility. By maintaining these relationships and leveraging our comprehensive management experience and operational, technical, and financial expertise, we can assist these local management teams in further improving operations and growing their businesses.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Disciplined Approach to Capital Allocation Designed for Long-Term Investment. We take a long-term view of our businesses, which we believe increases our chances of success and lowers risk. We have extensive transactional experience and a proven ability to source, develop, and exit investment opportunities and to take on the difficult task of integrating and optimizing acquired assets and businesses. In addition, we believe that our long, public track record of successful management and operations of critical communications networks is a key value that makes us an attractive partner for investment funds and other equity investments looking to make direct investments in businesses that own and operate communications infrastructure. When evaluating investment opportunities, whether externally or internally, we seek out infrastructure-based services that result in steady, long-term cash flows. The durability of these businesses generates steady excess cash flows over extended periods of time that we then utilize to re-invest in organic growth in our existing businesses, make strategic investments in additional businesses, and return cash to our investors through dividends or stock repurchases. In managing our more mature businesses, we seek to solidify our brands, improve customer satisfaction, add new services, control costs and preserve cash flow. In managing newer, early-stage businesses, we seek to invest capital to improve our competitive position, increase our market share and generate strong long-term revenue and cash flow potential. We consider new investments, acquisitions and dispositions on a disciplined, return-on-investment basis.

International Telecom Segment
Communications Services
Our International Telecom segment generates mobility services, fixed services, carrier services, and managed services revenues in Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Guyana and the US Virgin Islands. Revenues from our International 

4



Telecom segment were approximately 49% and 57% of our consolidated revenues for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
Fixed Services
High-speed data and related services. We offer high-speed broadband services to both residential and business customers in all our International Telecom markets. We provide a number of broadband internet plans with varying speeds to address different customer needs and price requirements in our various markets. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 148,300 broadband customers across our international markets and approximately 74% of those customers had access to high speed services.

Voice services. We offer fixed voice services that include local exchange, regional and long distance calling and voice messaging services in Bermuda, Guyana, and the US Virgin Islands. As of December 31, 2022, we had an aggregate of approximately 168,000 access lines in service in our markets, which serve both residential and business subscribers. With respect to our international long-distance business, we also collect payments from foreign carriers for handling international long-distance calls originating from the foreign carriers’ countries and terminating on our network. We also make payments to foreign carriers for international calls originating on one of our networks and terminating in the foreign carrier’s countries and collect from our subscribers or a local originating carrier a rate that is market-based or set by regulatory tariff.
Video services. We offer video services in Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, and the US Virgin Islands. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 32,000 video customers across our markets. We have several offerings available to our video customers, including basic and tiered local and cable TV channels grouped into various content categories, such as news, sports and entertainment.
Network. We offer our fixed services over our fiber-optic, copper and coaxial cable networks in our international markets. All fixed access lines in our network are digitally switched from our switching centers in the US Virgin Islands, Bermuda and Guyana. Our switching centers provide dedicated monitoring of our network to ensure quality and reliable service to our customers.
In Bermuda and the US Virgin Islands, we deliver our services via a hybrid fiber coaxial (“HFC”) cable network and via fiber-optic network. In the Cayman Islands and Guyana, we also provide fixed services via fiber-optic network, DSL and FWA. These networks give us expanded Internet access coverage within our International Telecom segment. Following hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017, service to our customers over the HFC network was impacted due to both the loss of power and damage to our network. We have completed remediation efforts to our network such as building tower structures to 160 MPH ratings and adding underground and alternate routes wherever possible.
Our international voice and data networks link with the rest of the world principally through our ownership and investments in six undersea fiber-optic cables in the Caribbean and Atlantic regions. These cables are crucial arteries that supply access to communications services for islands and remote markets like the ones in which we operate. For example, in Guyana we co-own with Telesur, the government-owned telecommunications provider in Suriname, the Suriname-Guyana Submarine Cable System. We believe that this submarine cable system provides us with more robust redundancy, the capacity to meet growing data demands in Guyana, and the opportunity to provide new and enhanced services such as Internet service. In Bermuda, we own the Challenger Bermuda cable that provides us with capacity from Bermuda to the United States.
Sales and Marketing. We provide fixed services, fixed account management and fixed Wi-Fi connectivity devices through six main distribution channels: digital, company owned and operated retail/pop-up retail, authorized dealers and agents, direct sales, inside sales and tele sales. Business and residential customers are able to purchase any of our stand alone or bundled data, managed services, security services, and voice services, POTs, Fiber Data, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) Data, or Fixed Wireless Data thorough any of the above channels. Customers post-pay for fixed services on a monthly basis. Customers are also able to purchase devices such as modems, routers, home security systems and accessories to enhance their services through these same channels. We bundle data connectivity devices and add-on 

5



accessories similar to what is available in most other countries. Our sales channels are strategically located throughout our service areas manned by trained, branded, and supported sales and service representatives.
Competition. We compete with a limited number of other providers, including Digicel and Liberty Latin America in select markets, with respect to various services. We believe our breadth of services and local economies of scale provide us with a strong competitive position and the ability to win and retain an economically viable share of those markets.
Mobility
We provide mobile, data, and voice services to retail and business customers in Bermuda under the “One” brand name, in Guyana under the “GTT” brand name and in the US Virgin Islands under the “Viya” brand name. We also provide roaming services for many of the largest US providers’ customers visiting these locations. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 378,000 mobile subscribers in our International Telecom segment and over 85% of those subscribers were on prepaid plans.

Products and Services. A significant majority of our customers in our International Telecom segment subscribe to one of our prepaid plans, which require customers to purchase an amount of voice minutes, text messages or data prior to use. A smaller minority of customers subscribe to our postpaid plans that allow customers to select a plan with voice minutes, text messaging, a given amount of data and other features that recur on a monthly basis, which services are billed at the end of the service period.
Network and Operations: We offer our mobility services over our 3G (WDCMA) 4G (LTE) wireless network in Bermuda and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In Guyana we offer our mobility services over our 2G (GSM), 3G (WCDMA) and 4G (LTE) wireless network. As of December 2022, we owned and operated a total of 1,024 base stations on 454 owned and leased sites in the international markets. All of our mobile networks have their core supporting facilities in the home network in the US Virgin Islands, Bermuda and Guyana. Our local NOCs provide dedicated monitoring of our network to ensure quality and reliable service to our customers and during off hours, weekends and holidays our NOC in the mainland USA provides extended support to ensure we have 24-hour, year-round monitoring of all our wireless and wireline markets.
The transport networks in all the markets are primarily fiber based with route diversity provided by the deployment of fiber rings where possible and supplemental microwave deployments. The vast majority of the networks are IP Based utilizing MPLS for redundancy to provide high availability networks. Standby power is provided by back up battery and generators. In the US Virgin Islands where we have experienced extreme hurricane events, network hardening has been added to the network such as building tower structures to 160 MPH ratings and adding underground and alternate routes wherever possible. All the markets connect to the world through sub-sea fiber networks described in our “International Telecom – Fixed – Network” section below.
Sales and Marketing. We provide services, mobile connectivity devices and account management through six main distribution channels: digital, Company owned retail/pop-up retail, authorized dealers/agents, direct sales, inside sales and telesales. Business and residential customers are able to purchase any of our services, Prepaid Mobile, Postpaid Mobile, and Mobile Data, through any of the above channels. Customers are also able to purchase devices, and accessories to enhance their services through these same channels. We offer a full suite of mobile devices and add on accessories similar to what is available in most other countries in the world. Our sales channels are strategically located throughout our service areas manned by trained, branded, and supported sales and service representatives.
Handsets and Accessories. We offer a diverse line of wireless devices and accessories designed to meet both the personal and professional needs of our customers. Our device assortment includes a wide range of smartphones including those featuring the Android™ and iOS™ operating systems in addition to a full line of feature phones, wireless hot spots and various wireless solutions for small businesses. To complement our phone offerings, we sell a complete range of original equipment manufacturer and after-market accessories that allow our customers to 

6



personalize their wireless experience, including phone protection, battery charging solutions and Bluetooth hands-free kits.
Competition. We believe we compete for wireless retail customers in our international markets based on features, price, technology deployed, network coverage (including through roaming arrangements), quality of service and customer care. We compete against Digicel and Liberty Latin America in the Caribbean region, other smaller local providers, and in some markets, against one or more US national operators.

US Telecom Segment
Communication Services
Our US Telecom segment generates fixed services, carrier services, mobility services, and managed services revenues in Alaska and parts of the western United States.
In July 2021, we completed the acquisition of Alaska Communications Systems Group, Inc. (“Alaska Communications”), an Alaska based entity that provides fixed services, carrier services and managed services to primarily carrier and business customers in the State of Alaska and beyond using its statewide and interstate telecommunications network. At the same time, we entered into an agreement with affiliates and investment funds managed by Freedom 3 Capital, LLC as well as other institutional investors (collectively the “Freedom 3 Investors”) to fund the Alaska Transaction. As a result of the Alaska Transaction, we now own approximately 52% of the common equity of Alaska Communications and control its operations and management. Beginning on July 22, 2021, the results of the Alaska Transaction are included in our US Telecom segment.
In November 2022, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of Sacred Wind Enterprises, Inc. (“Sacred Wind”), a rural telecommunications provider in New Mexico (the “Sacred Wind Transaction”). As part of the Sacred Wind Transaction, the Company paid a combination of cash and equity for Sacred Wind, resulting in the Sacred Wind Stockholders becoming minority owners in the combined Commnet and Sacred Wind businesses. Beginning on November 7, 2022, the results of the Sacred Wind Transaction are included in our US Telecom segment.
Revenues from our US Telecom segment were approximately 51% and 43% of our consolidated revenues for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Carrier Services
Carrier Services. In Alaska, we provide wholesale voice and internet connectivity to carrier customers. In the western United States, we provide wholesale mobile voice and data roaming services in rural markets and wholesale transport services on a smaller scale to national, regional, local and selected international wireless carriers as part of our carrier services as well as tower rental, backhaul and maintenance services. Our largest wholesale networks are located principally in the western United States.
In Alaska, we provide connectivity to our wholesale customers, either through direct sales of wholesale transport over our terrestrial or subsea networks or by entering into transactions whereby we agree to build, host or maintain networks on behalf of another carrier over a contracted term. 
We currently have roaming agreements with each of the three US national wireless network carriers (AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon Wireless) along with several other wireless service providers. Other than these agreements with the national carriers, our standard roaming agreements are usually terminable within 90 days. While we continue to provide services pursuant to these roaming agreements, due to demand from our carrier customers, we have shifted our business focus away from traditional roaming and toward a network infrastructure model of carrier services further described below. In 2022, the three national mobile service providers together accounted for 65% of our carrier services 

7



revenues, with AT&T and Verizon accounting for an aggregate of approximately 12% of our total consolidated Communication Services revenue for the year.

In the western United States, we are increasingly providing network infrastructure services as part of our expanded carrier services, such as tower leasing and transport facilities to our carrier partners, to supplement our historic revenue base. In July 2019, we agreed to build a portion of AT&T’s network for the First Responder Network Authority (“FirstNet”) as well as a commercial wireless network in or near its current operating area in the western United States pursuant to a Network Build and Maintenance Agreement with AT&T (the “FirstNet Transaction”). Pursuant to the FirstNet Transaction and subject to certain limitations contained therein, we expect to substantially complete the build by the end of 2023. Following the acceptance of a cell site pursuant to the FirstNet Agreement, AT&T owns the radio equipment constructed on the cell site and we assign to AT&T any third-party tower lease applicable to such cell site. If the cell site is located on a communications tower we own, AT&T pays us pursuant to a separate lease agreement for an initial term of eight years. In addition to building the network, we are providing ongoing equipment and site maintenance and high-capacity transport from these cell sites to AT&T’s core network for an initial term ending in 2029. 
Pursuant to the FirstNet Transaction, AT&T has the option to repay construction costs, with interest, over an eight year period. Accordingly, we entered into a receivables credit facility with CoBank, ACB (the “Receivables Credit Facility”) to assist with this repayment option. The Receivables Credit Facility provides for a senior secured delayed draw term loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to $75 million with the proceeds being used to acquire the receivables related to the construction costs.
Sales and Marketing. Our wholesale transport customers are predominately communications carriers such as local exchange carriers, wireless carriers, internet service providers and interstate integrated providers.
We believe that our ability to deliver reliable, high capacity backhaul across multiple provider footprints, both from licensed fixed wireless microwave and fiber access solutions, creates value for our customers who are typically unable to scale their rural access capacities as rapidly and successfully as they can in less remote markets. We are investing in the expansion of our regional fiber and network asset footprint, and in enhanced network reliability and route diversity, in the expectation that our carrier customers will have greater demand for higher capacity, higher reliability and lower latency backhaul to support their own investments in 5G network deployments.
Mobility Services
Mobility Services. We also offer mobile services to retail customers in certain rural markets already covered by our wholesale networks in the Southwestern United States. We do not offer mobility services in Alaska. 
As of December 31, 2022, we owned and operated a total of 319 towers and 293 fiber connected towers,, a Network Operations Center (or “NOC”), and a switching center. In July 2022, we were approved to participate in the Federal Communication Commission’s Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Reimbursement Program (the “Replace and Remove Program”), designed to reimburse providers of communications services for reasonable costs incurred in the required removal, replacement, and disposal of covered communications equipment that have been deemed to pose a national security risk. Pursuant to the Replace and Remove Program, we have been allocated up to approximately $206 million to replace, remove and securely destroy all prohibited communications equipment in our Southwestern United States network. We have also been approved to receive approximately $1 million to replace, remove and securely destroy all prohibited communications equipment in our network in the US Virgin Islands. The Replace and Remove Program requires us to complete our first request for reimbursement for services performed under the program no later than July 14, 2023 and that we complete the project no later than one year from submitting our initial reimbursement request. 
Network and Operations. Our roaming network has historically offered mobile communications service through a digital wireless voice and data network that utilizes multiple cellular mobile technologies including UMTS/HSPA, CDMA/EvDO and LTE that often will be deployed at a single cell site location to maximize revenue opportunities. As we undertake our Replace and Remove build, we will no longer provide UMTS/HSPA or CDMA/EvDO services and 

8



will transition away from providing roaming services to a network infrastructure-based services framework whereby we provide tower lease space, the use of carrier equipment and backhaul in lieu of roaming to support carrier services. We provide wireless communications network products and services with owned and leased cellular, PCS, BRS, EBS, AWS, and Citizens Broadband Radio Services (“CBRS”) spectrum. Our networks comprise base stations and radio transceivers located on owned or leased towers and buildings, telecommunications switches and owned or leased transport facilities. We design and construct our network in a manner intended to provide high-quality service to substantially all types of compatible wireless devices. Network reliability is carefully considered and redundancy is employed in many aspects of our network design.
Route diversity, redundant equipment, ring topologies, battery backup and the use of emergency standby power are used to enhance network reliability and minimize service disruptions from any particular network element failure. We operate high-capacity, carrier-class digital wireless switching systems that are capable of serving multiple markets through a single mobile telephone switching office. Centralized equipment used for network and data management is located in high-availability facilities supported by multiple levels of power and network redundancy. Our systems are designed to incorporate Internet Protocol (IP) packet-based Ethernet technology, which allows for increased data capacity and a more efficient network. Interconnection between the mobile telephone switching office and the cell sites utilizes Ethernet technology over fiber or microwave links for virtually all of our sites.
Competition. With respect to our carrier services, we compete with mobile service providers that operate networks in our markets and offer wholesale roaming services. Historically, the most significant competitive challenge we face in our US wholesale wireless business is the extent to which our carrier customers choose not to roam on our networks or elect to build or acquire their own infrastructure in a market in which we operate, reducing or eliminating their need for our roaming services in those markets. We are addressing this competitive threat mainly by offering a managed carrier services solution to build and maintain base stations and provide backhaul between our sites and the carrier’s mobile telephone switching office, thereby delivering a native coverage experience to the carrier’s end-customers. While these solutions are similarly vulnerable to competitive overbuild, managed carrier services are offered under longer-term agreements providing us with a predictable source of revenue to support our operating costs. 
Fixed Services
Services. In Alaska, we provide fiber broadband and managed IT services, offering technology and service enabled customer solutions to business and wholesale customers in and out of Alaska. We also provide telecommunication services to consumers in the most populated communities throughout the state. Our facilities-based communications network connects to the contiguous states via our two diverse undersea fiber optic cable systems. We provide high-capacity data networking, internet connectivity, voice communications and IT Services. Networking services include Ethernet and IP routed services as well as switched and dedicated voice services. In addition, we offer other value-added services such as network hosting, managed IT services and long-distance services. Our network is among the most expansive in Alaska and forms the foundation of service to our customers. We operate in a largely two-player terrestrial wireline market and our customers are primarily business customers.
In the western United States, we provide fixed services to business customers such as schools, libraries, mine operators and state and local governments as well as residential customers.
As of December 31, 2022, we pass roughly 442,000 premises with broadband connectivity of some kind in our U.S. Telecom segment.
Network. In Alaska, we provide communications and IT solutions that connect Alaskans, as well as customers in the continental United States, to the world. This is based on an extensive facilities-based wireline telecommunications network in Alaska that we operate. We continuously upgrade our network to provide higher levels of performance, higher bandwidth speeds, increased levels of security and additional value-added services to our customers. We operate significant terrestrial and submarine fiber miles which serve as the backbone of our network as well as now serving over 1,000 buildings with fiber. Our networks are monitored for performance around the clock in redundant monitoring centers to provide a high level of reliability and performance. Our network is extensive within Alaska’s urban areas and connects 

9



our largest markets, including Anchorage, Fairbanks and Juneau with each other and the contiguous states as well as many rural areas. Residential broadband customers are served in Alaska with copper-based DSL internet access, and in 2022 we began deploying fiber-to-the-home broadband service to certain markets. Beginning in the summer of 2022, we began offering to deliver fiber-optic network connectivity directly to select homes and businesses in Anchorage, Fairbanks and select smaller markets. As of December 31, 2022, we advanced our initial pilot program by passing over homes with this next generation broadband technology and we currently intend to continue to expand our fiber to the home build. We continue to utilize fixed wireless technology over spectrum to reach even more customers, and we expanded our Multi-Dwelling Unit (“MDU”) offering utilizing fiber or fixed wireless backhaul. 
We own and operate two undersea fiber optic cable systems that provide diverse routing from our Alaskan network to our facilities in Oregon and Washington. These facilities provide survivable service to and from Alaska, with key monitoring and disaster recovery capabilities for our customers. We also have usage rights on a third undersea fiber network connecting Alaska to the continental United States. Our network in Oregon and Washington includes terrestrial transport components linking our landing stations to a Network Operations Control Center in Hillsboro, Oregon and collocation facilities in Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington. In addition, AKORN®, one of our undersea fiber optic cable systems, connects our Alaska network from Homer, Alaska to our facilities in Florence, Oregon along a diverse path within Alaska, the Pacific Northwest and undersea in the Pacific Ocean. Northstar, our other undersea fiber optic system, has cable landing facilities in Whittier, Juneau, and Valdez, Alaska, and Nedonna Beach, Oregon. In 2020, we completed major network upgrades to the Northstar fiber line, increasing capacity by more than five times. Together, our subsea fiber optic cables systems, AKORN® and Northstar, provide extensive bandwidth as well as survivability protection designed to serve our own, as well as our most demanding customers’ critical communications requirements. Through our landing stations in Oregon, we also provide an at-the-ready landing point for other large fiber optic cables, and their operators, connecting the U.S. to networks in Asia and other parts of the world. 
Our terrestrial fiber network on the North Slope of Alaska allows us to provide broadband solutions to the oil and gas sector and to advance our sales of managed IT services. Rural healthcare, education and business customers are served by a satellite earth station network utilizing a combination of GEO and LEO satellite capacity. These satellite services are used to provide Internet and WAN backhaul connectivity to our customers.
We have deployed, and are working to deploy more, carrier-grade fiber optic networks strategically throughout the western United States to continue to serve governmental, educational, healthcare, business, consumer and tribal customers in Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah.
Competition. In Alaska, we face strong competition in our markets from larger competitors with substantial resources. For traditional voice and broadband services, we compete with GCI and AT&T on a statewide basis, and smaller providers such as Matanuska Telephone Association, Inc., a co-op owned telephone and internet service provider operating in the Matanuska Valley region of Alaska, on a more local basis. As the largest facilities-based operator in Alaska, GCI is the dominant statewide provider of broadband, voice, wireless and video services. We believe that AT&T’s primary focus is to be the provider of voice and broadband services to its nation-wide customers and that AT&T tends to use its existing broadband network to serve these customers or it leases capacity from GCI or Alaska Communications to augment its existing network.
In the western United States, we experience competitive pressures from ILEC providers such as AT&T, Lumen and Frontier along with their channel partners. Similarly, national fiber providers such as Zayo also offer our customers services and employ vast wholesale channel solutions. Our ability to offer full-service solutions across multiple LEC service areas and very remote sites back to mobile telephone switching offices continues to be market differentiator and a driver for our success.
In the western United States, we are continuing to expand our capacity offerings with a focus on enhancing our owned and leased transport facilities. Expansion of our network anchored by new fiber deployments is facilitating a long-held vision for reducing reliance on limited capacity microwave backhaul and enabling new wholesale agreements with additional national and regional carriers for both lit and dark fiber services.

ATN Ventures and Minority Investments
In addition to our core telecommunications operating companies, we have also made investments in earlier stage businesses, some of which are noncontrolling investments whose technology-forward approach we consider strategically relevant and can also provide a variety of benefits that enhance the potential to expand our more mature businesses. These benefits include providing entry points into emerging sectors of our existing businesses, enhancing our product offerings, providing visibility into newer technologies and establishing and enhancing strategic relationships.

We know that our employees are one of our most valuable assets to realize our mission to digitally empower people and communities so they can connect with the world and prosper. We do this through meeting the everyday connectivity needs of rural and historically underserved communities. We developed the values listed below to reflect both our current culture and the values that we strive to embody to attract and maintain key talent. We endeavor to implement these values every day through employee engagement events, regular communication on company goals and milestones, and foster a fun and diverse workplace.

ATN Workforce Overview
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2,400 employees, of whom approximately 1,100 were employed in the United States (including the US Virgin Islands), and approximately 1,300 were employed by our international subsidiaries. At the holding company level, we employ our executive management team and staff. Approximately 22% of our total employee population are covered by contracts with various unions. Employees represented by unions are located in Alaska and all our international markets except for the Cayman Islands. As of the end of 2022, we believe we have a good relationship with our unions. 
Commitment to Local Management, Diversity and Inclusion
We seek engaged managers who have strong values, integrity, knowledge of our market and business model, and have respect for differing viewpoints. We strive to create a diverse working environment that creates a greater understanding of our differences and makes us a stronger company. 
We rely heavily on local management teams to run our subsidiary operating units. Many of the markets in which we operate are small and remote, and in some cases are subject to government restrictions on granting work visas, all of which makes it difficult to attract and retain talented and qualified managers and staff in those markets. 
Employee Engagement and Development
Together with our subsidiaries, we are working hard to improve the way technology is used in the diverse communities we serve. We believe having management and staff that are as diverse as the communities in which they operate is crucial to our success and to our ability to have a positive impact on those communities. We celebrate different 

11



perspectives and backgrounds because we believe they help us to have a stronger, more creative, and more successful workplace.
We are proud to offer benefits to our employees that promote wellness and personal care, a safe work environment and career growth opportunities. We regularly utilize performance development tools for our employees, which are focused on driving engagement and high performance through frequent communications throughout the year. 
Our annual employee engagement survey provides employees with the opportunity to share confidential feedback on what they believe has been working well and where they believe we can improve to better support our employees. Our focus areas for engagement include skills development, manager performance, and diversity. Anonymous, aggregated results are shared with employees, and the results are used to drive our long-term action plans for how we can seek to continue to improve our work culture.

Regulation
Our wireless and wireline telecommunications and video services operations are subject to extensive governmental regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which we provide services. Our wireless and wireline operations and our video services operations in the United States and the US Virgin Islands are governed by the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, including via the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (“Communications Act”); the implementing regulations adopted thereunder by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”); judicial and regulatory decisions interpreting and implementing the Communications Act; and other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. Our operations are also governed by certain foreign laws and regulations.
The following summary of regulatory developments and legislation does not purport to describe all present and proposed federal, state, local, and foreign regulation and legislation that may affect our businesses. Legislative or regulatory requirements currently applicable to our businesses may change in the future and legislative or regulatory requirements may be adopted by those jurisdictions that currently have none. Any such changes could impose new obligations on us that could adversely affect our operating results.

US Federal Regulation
At the federal level, we are regulated in large part by the FCC. 
Wireless Services
The FCC regulates, among other things, the licensed and unlicensed use of radio spectrum; the ownership, lease, transfer of control and assignment of wireless licenses; the ongoing technical, operational, and service requirements applicable to such licenses; the timing, nature, and scope of network construction; the provision of certain services, such as enhanced 911 (“E-911”); and the interconnection of communications networks in the United States.

Spectrum Licenses. We provide our wireless services pursuant to various commercial mobile radio services (“CMRS”) licenses issued by the FCC. Some of these licenses are site-based while others cover specified geographic market areas. The specific radio frequencies, the authorized spectrum amounts, and certain of the technical and service rules vary depending on the licensed service. The FCC generally allocates CMRS licenses through periodic auctions. CMRS licenses also are available via secondary market mechanisms subject to FCC procedures and regulations. The FCC also permits licensees to lease spectrum to third parties under certain conditions, subject to prior FCC approval, or in some instances, notification to the FCC. Auctions, secondary market transactions and spectrum leasing provide additional flexibility for wireless providers to structure transactions and create additional business and investment opportunities, and, like our competitors, we will monitor and pursue opportunities to obtain additional spectrum rights. The FCC reviews proposed license acquisitions on a case-by-case basis to ensure that the acquisition would serve the public interest and would not result in a rule violation or an undue concentration of market power. With respect to CMRS licenses, the FCC 

12



utilizes a spectrum aggregation “screen” to determine whether a proposed secondary market transaction requires additional scrutiny. The FCC’s additional scrutiny also would be triggered if a proposed transaction results in a material change in the post transaction market share in a particular market. With the exception of the US Virgin Islands, we are, in each of the areas in which we hold geographic area license or lease rights, well below the level of spectrum aggregation that would warrant additional FCC scrutiny, and thus we may be able to acquire additional spectrum rights either from the FCC in an auction or from third parties in private transactions. 
In addition to CMRS licenses, our wireless business relies on common carrier and non-common carrier fixed point-to-point microwave licenses issued by the FCC. Microwave stations are generally used in a point-to-point configuration for cellular site backhaul connections or to connect points on the telephone network that cannot be cost effectively connected using standard wireline or fiber optic cable because of cost or terrain. 
Most of our license grants are for a period of 10 years and are renewable upon application to the FCC. License renewal applications may be denied if the FCC determines, after appropriate notice and hearing, that renewal would not serve the public interest, convenience, or necessity. While our license renewal applications have been regularly granted by the FCC in the past, there can be no assurance that all of our licenses will be renewed in the future. The FCC also may deny license applications and, in extreme cases, revoke licenses if it finds that an entity lacks the requisite qualifications to be a licensee. To our knowledge, there are no circumstances that would warrant such a finding by the FCC against us. 
The FCC conditions spectrum licenses on the satisfaction of certain obligations to construct networks covering a specified geographic area or population by specific dates. The obligations vary depending on the licensed service. Failure to satisfy an applicable construction requirement can result in the assessment of fines and forfeitures by the FCC, a reduced license term, or automatic license cancellation. We are substantially in compliance with the applicable construction requirements that have arisen for the licenses we currently hold and expect to meet our future construction requirements as well. 
Other Requirements. The Communications Act and the FCC’s rules impose additional requirements upon wireless service providers. A failure to meet or maintain compliance with the Communications Act and/or the FCC’s rules may subject us to fines, forfeitures, penalties, or other sanctions. To our knowledge, we comply in all material respects with applicable FCC technical and reporting requirements.
The radio systems towers that we own and lease are subject to Federal Aviation Administration and FCC regulations that govern the location, marking, lighting, and construction of towers and are subject to the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, National Historic Preservation Act, and other environmental statutes enforced by the FCC. The FCC has also adopted guidelines and methods for evaluating human exposure to radiofrequency field emissions from radio equipment. To our knowledge, all of our radio systems on towers that we own or lease comply in all material respects with these requirements, guidelines, and methods.
The FCC has adopted requirements for CMRS providers to implement basic 911 and E-911 services. These services provide state and local emergency service providers with the ability to better identify and locate 911 callers using wireless services, including callers using special devices for the hearing impaired. The FCC also has adopted rules requiring wireless carriers and certain other text messaging service providers to provide text-to-911. Because the implementation of these obligations requires that the local emergency services provider have certain facilities available, our specific obligations are set on a market-by-market basis as emergency service providers request the implementation of E-911 services within their locales. To our knowledge, we comply with all E-911 obligations currently applicable to our operations, but the extent to which we are required to deploy additional E-911 services will affect our capital spending obligations. Federal law limits our liability for uncompleted 911 calls to a degree commensurate with wireline carriers in our markets.
We are obligated to pay certain annual regulatory fees and assessments to support FCC wireless industry regulation, as well as fees supporting federal universal service programs, number portability, regional database costs, centralized telephone numbering administration, telecommunications relay service for the hearing impaired and application filing fees. These fees are subject to change periodically by the FCC and the manner in which carriers may 

13



recoup these fees from customers is subject to various restrictions. To our knowledge, we comply in all material respects with applicable FCC regulatory fee and assessment requirements.
Fixed Services
The FCC generally exercises jurisdiction over the interstate and international telecommunications services that we provide as a regulated common carrier in Alaska and the US Virgin Islands. The Communications Act and regulations promulgated thereunder require, among other things, that we offer regulated interstate telecommunications common carrier services at just, reasonable, and non-discriminatory rates and terms. The Communications Act also requires us to offer competing carriers interconnection and non-discriminatory access to certain facilities and services designated as essential for local competition. 
We are subject to competitive market forces, as well as rate-of-return regulation for intrastate services that originate and terminate in Alaska and the US Virgin Islands and price-cap rate regulation for interstate services in Alaska and the US Virgin Islands regulated by the FCC. Because we face competition, we may not be able to charge the maximum permitted rates under price-cap regulation or realize the authorized intrastate rate of return. A broader range of data and information services are offered by our unregulated affiliates or as unregulated services by our regulated companies. 
The FCC regulates the prices that we charge for the use of our local telephone facilities in originating or terminating interstate calls. In Alaska and the US Virgin Islands, rates for interstate telecommunications services we offer are determined using price cap regulation, under which the rates vary from year to year based on mathematical formulae, and not based on changes to our costs, including both inter-carrier rates and retail end user rates. The FCC also regulates rates for “business data services,” which are those circuit-switched or packet-switched services that offer dedicated point-to-point transmission of data at certain guaranteed speeds and service levels using high-capacity connections, including special access services, but the FCC has generally forborne from regulating our rates for these services, except on certain routes that the FCC believes lack sufficient competition.
Caller ID Authentication. In March 2020, the FCC issued a Report and Order implementing the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence (“TRACED”) Act by mandating that voice service providers such as our Alaska and US Virgin Islands businesses implement the STIR/SHAKEN caller ID authentication framework in the Internet Protocol (“IP”) portions of their networks by June 30, 2021. The TRACED Act directs the FCC to require all voice service providers to implement STIR/SHAKEN in the IP portions of their networks and implement an effective caller ID authentication framework in the non-IP portions of their networks. We comply with these requirements. 
National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. In July 2020, the FCC adopted a Report and Order designating the three-digit code “988” as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and directed all service providers to enable use of that code to reach suicide prevention and crisis intervention services no later than July 16, 2022. There are 87 area codes across the country, including the “907” area code used throughout Alaska, where local calls may be dialed using seven digits, and where “988” is used as a three-digit telephone exchange prefix. To ensure that calls are not erroneously routed to the National Suicide Prevention Hotline when a user intends to dial a seven-digit call starting with “988,” the FCC required all 87 of the affected area codes to transition to ten-digit dialing for all calls during the transition period. As a result of these changes, Alaska Communications upgraded and reprogramed its switches throughout the state and is assisting with consumer education efforts with respect to these new dialing patterns.
 The Communications Act encourages competition in local telecommunications markets by removing barriers to market entry and imposing on non-rural incumbent local exchange carriers (“ILECs”) various requirements related to, among other things, interconnection, access to unbundled network elements, co-location, access to poles, ducts, conduits, and rights of way, wholesale and resale obligations, and telephone number portability. Our ILEC operations in the US Virgin Islands through Viya are exempt from most such federal requirements pursuant to a rural exemption.
While, to date, the FCC has declined to classify interconnected voice-over Internet protocol (“VoIP”) service as a telecommunications service or information service, it has imposed a number of consumer protection and public safety obligations on interconnected VoIP providers, relying in large part on its general ancillary jurisdiction powers. To the 

14



extent that we provide interconnected VoIP service, we are subject to a number of these obligations, and, to our knowledge, we comply in all material respects with applicable VoIP requirements.
Fixed and Wireless Services
Net Neutrality. In January 2018, the FCC released a decision rescinding various “net neutrality” requirements that had governed how broadband Internet access providers were permitted to offer broadband service. This decision largely eliminated the FCC’s regulation of our ability to block, throttle, or prioritize specific types of Internet traffic, and put a revised transparency-centered regulatory regime in place. Under the 2018 decision’s approach, broadband Internet access providers still must publicly disclose detailed information regarding their service offerings, Internet traffic management processes, and other practices affecting broadband customers. The FCC also held that states are preempted from enacting their own versions of these or similar requirements. A federal appeals court upheld most of the FCC’s 2018 decision, but it reversed the FCC’s blanket preemption of state broadband rules. The court also (1) held that state broadband laws may only be preempted on a case-by-case basis when they conflict with state or federal policy, and (2) remanded certain issues to the FCC. The court subsequently declined to rehear the case, and no party sought review by the U.S. Supreme Court. In October 2020, the FCC affirmed its 2018 decision after addressing the issues remanded by the court. That decision is subject to petitions for reconsideration before the FCC (which the agency has not acted on) and a challenge in federal court that currently is on hold. A new Chairwoman of the FCC was appointed in December 2021, and she has stated publicly that she supports the FCC once again adopting net neutrality requirements. Although she has not yet initiated any such effort, if the Chairwoman were to do so, we cannot predict how such regulation will affect our broadband businesses.
A number of states have adopted, or are considering adopting, state-level net neutrality requirements, some of which have gone into effect and some of which are stayed. These efforts include state legislation and executive orders dating back to 2018. We cannot predict with any certainty the likely timing or outcome of any legal challenges to state net neutrality requirements, how state or federal efforts to adopt net neutrality requirements will continue to evolve, or how these regulatory proceedings will impact our business.

In addition, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (“IIJA”), enacted in November 2021, directed the FCC to require broadband service providers to display “nutrition labels” containing certain information regarding their broadband internet access service plans. In November 2022, the FCC adopted implementing requirements. The decision requires broadband service providers to display, at the point of sale, labels that disclose information about broadband prices, introductory rates, data allowances, broadband speeds, and latency. These rules are not yet in effect. The FCC is seeking comment on adopting additional specific requirements regarding the “nutrition label.” We cannot predict how a future FCC will address transparency requirements.
Digital Discrimination. The IIJA requires the FCC to adopt rules addressing “digital discrimination of access” by November 15, 2023. We cannot predict how the FCC will implement this direction and what impact it may have on our business.
Telecommunications Privacy Regulations. We are subject to federal regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all parts of our business. Certain federal statutory and regulatory privacy and data security requirements apply to our telecommunications and cable services. Other parts of our business are subject to privacy and data security oversight by other federal regulators, including the Federal Trade Commission. In addition, federal and state regulators have adopted or are considering adopting new privacy laws. Such state privacy regulations could impact at least some of our operations. We believe that we comply with all currently applicable requirements, but we cannot predict the timeline for any future changes of law in this area or the impact of any such changes on our businesses.
CALEA. Under certain circumstances, federal law also requires telecommunications carriers to provide law enforcement agencies with capacity and technical capabilities to support lawful wiretaps pursuant to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (“CALEA”). Federal law also requires compliance with wiretap related record keeping and personnel related obligations. The FCC has adopted rules that apply CALEA obligations to high-speed Internet access and VoIP services. We believe that we comply with all such requirements currently applicable to us. 

15



Maintaining compliance with these law enforcement requirements may impose additional capital spending obligations on us to make necessary system upgrades.
Infrastructure Access Regulation. In recent years, the FCC has taken actions to help expedite the deployment of wireline and wireless network infrastructure. Those actions include adopting rules to facilitate the attachment of new facilities to utility poles, improving access by telecommunications companies to rights-of-way, and eliminating or reducing requirements to provide notice of service discontinuance. We expect these FCC actions will facilitate and streamline our ability to expand our wireline and wireless network coverage. 
Universal Service Support and Contributions
In general, all telecommunications providers are obligated to contribute to the Universal Service Fund (“USF”), which is used to promote the availability of qualifying telecommunications and broadband service to individuals and families qualifying for federal assistance, households located in rural and high-cost areas, and to schools, libraries, and rural health care providers. We are subject to audit by the Universal Service Administration Company with respect to our federal contributions and our receipts of universal service funding. To our knowledge, we comply in all material respects with applicable federal and state USF assessment and support requirements.
USF High-Cost Support. In 2011, the FCC released a Transformation Order that established a new framework for high-cost universal service support for price capped carriers. The new framework replaced existing support mechanisms that provide support to carriers that serve high-cost areas. The new support mechanism, the Connect America Fund (“CAF”), imposes service obligations that are focused on broadband Internet access services. The Transformation Order also replaced the FCC’s previous set of explicit high-cost universal service support mechanisms for price cap carriers, like Alaska Communications, with the CAF. While the previous mechanisms were focused on supporting a portion of the cost of providing voice telephone service, the CAF shifted that focus to expanding the availability of affordable broadband services. In October 2016, the FCC released its order establishing the requirements of CAF II (“CAF II”) for price cap carriers in Alaska — specifically Alaska Communications, the only price cap carrier in Alaska. Under the CAF II order, we receive approximately $19.7 million annually in Alaska through December 31, 2025, subject to explicit broadband deployment conditions.
In August 2018, we were separately awarded $79.9 million over 10 years by the FCC as part of its CAF II USF auction for our operations in the southwestern United States. The funding requires us to provide fixed broadband and voice services to certain eligible areas in the United States within six years of the award of the funding. We are subject to operational and reporting requirements under the program. Funding began in the second quarter of 2019 and we record the amounts received as revenue in our financial statements. We are continuing to work toward meeting our CAF II obligations in a capital-efficient manner, including the delivery of broadband Internet access services meeting CAF II requirements using a fixed wireless platform and in some instances in Alaska, DSL. As of December 31, 2022, we have met 60% of the total number of locations served required by December 31, 2025 under Alaska CAF II. As of December 31, 2022, we have not yet met our requirement to reach 40% coverage in two of the states in our western US market, but we expect that we will be able to meet our goal of 60% coverage by the end of this year in all of our markets. Although we expect to comply in all material respects with our deployment and service requirements associated with our CAF II funding, if we fail to meet our obligations under the CAF II order or require substantial additional capital expenditures in order to meet the obligations under the timeline required, its revenue, results of operations and liquidity may be materially adversely impacted. 
In addition, in the 2020 Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Phase I (“RDOF”) auction, we were awarded $28.4 million and accepted $20.1 million over 10 years. We declined to accept the remaining support that we were awarded in the auction, and we will owe default penalties with respect to these winning bids. In exchange for this RDOF support, we are required to deploy voice and broadband service to areas covered by our winning bids within six years and to provide service in those areas for ten years. We expect to comply in all material respects with those obligations. 
In 2018, the FCC initiated a proceeding to reform the USF program for high-cost support in the USVI and Puerto Rico. In September 2019, the FCC adopted an order in this proceeding establishing a new competitive proposal process 

16



for awarding Connect USVI Fund support that would supplant the annual support that Viya received. Viya submitted a bid for Connect USVI Fund support allocated for the US Virgin Islands, but in November 2020, the FCC announced that Viya was not the recipient of the award. As a result, Viya’s USF support was reduced to 2/3 of the legacy total amount, or $10.9 million, from August 2021 through July 2022 and to 1/3 of the legacy total amount, or $5.5 million, during the subsequent 12-month period. Thereafter, pursuant to the terms of the 2018 Order, the $5.5 million in high-cost USF support received by Viya is scheduled to be eliminated entirely in July 2023. However, in October 2022, the FCC proposed to extend this support at the $5.5 million per year level to December 31, 2025, and sought comment on this proposal. The FCC has not yet taken action on its proposal, and we cannot predict whether the FCC will extend this support and, if so, what amount the FCC will provide and for how long. 
Rural Health Care Universal Service Support Program. The FCC’s Rural Health Care Universal Service Support Mechanism (“RHC program”) provides funding to help make broadband telecommunications and Internet access services provided by us and other service providers affordable for eligible rural health care providers. It is comprised of two parts. The Telecommunications Program covers the difference between the “urban rate” for telecommunications services that rural healthcare providers use to deliver healthcare at rural locations, and the “rural rate” that they would otherwise be required to pay. The Healthcare Connect Fund covers 65 percent of the cost of a wide variety of broadband telecommunications, networking, and Internet access services and certain associated equipment. 
 In August 2019, the FCC adopted an order making comprehensive changes to the rules governing the competitive bidding process and the method for determining the urban and rural rates used to calculate the amount of RHC Telecommunications Program support payments for which a health care provider is eligible. The changes to the urban and rural rate rules took effect for Funding Year 2021, which began in July 2021. Among other things, the FCC’s Order directed USAC to develop and publish a database containing available rural rates and rate medians that will cap the amount of RHC support eligible healthcare providers may receive for a given service in a particular geographic zone. The FCC’s Order divided Alaska into four geographic zones, with the rural rate in each zone capped at the median of the rural rates for similar services offered in that zone, as identified by USAC. In October 2019, an appeal challenging the new method of setting rates for supported services was filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, adding further uncertainty to the ultimate outcome of this proceeding. Similarly, we and several other parties filed Petitions for Reconsideration of the FCC’s August 2019 Report and Order, asking the FCC to reconsider some of its changes to the rural healthcare rate-setting process. Both the action in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and the Petitions for Reconsideration filed with the FCC remain pending.
We believe that USAC’s rural rate database, as currently constituted, is likely to have an adverse impact on our economic ability to continue to serve some of our rural healthcare customers in Alaska. In particular, the rates established by the database would negatively impact our ability to continue to offer our full range of telecommunications services to rural healthcare providers supported by the RHC Telecommunications Program in the more remote, higher-cost areas of the state. We filed an Application for Review requesting that the full FCC review USAC’s effort and associated guidance concerning the database, delay the effectiveness of the new rural rates, and direct USAC to implement the changes we requested in our prior Petition for Reconsideration. In January 2021, the FCC issued an order waiving the use of the database in Alaska for Funding Years 2021 and 2022. In lieu of the database, while the waiver remains in effect, the Order authorizes support based on the most recent rural rate that the FCC approved for the same service at the same healthcare facility within the past three funding years. As an alternative, RHC Telecommunications Program rural rates may be established under the previously applicable rate rules that were in effect through Funding Year 2020. As with the action in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and the Petitions for Reconsideration filed with the FCC, the other issues raised in our Application for Review remain pending.
We are unable to predict the outcome or eventual impact of the D.C. Circuit’s review of the FCC’s Order, or the FCC’s decision on our Petition for Reconsideration or our Application for Review, but the January 2021 waiver offers a measure of short-term stability for the Telecommunications Program while those reviews continue.

 Subsidies for Low-Income Customers. The FCC’s Lifeline support mechanism provides a subsidy to eligible low-income consumers against the cost of voice services, as well as broadband in CAF II locations. We participate in the Lifeline program on a limited basis. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 appropriated $3.2 billion to create the 

17



“Emergency Broadband Connectivity Fund,” and directed the FCC to use that fund to establish a new “Emergency Broadband Benefit Program” (“EBBP”). The EBBP provided eligible low-income consumers and students with a monthly subsidy for the purchase of broadband Internet access service from service providers that elected to participate in the program, which we did. Starting on January 1, 2022, the FCC replaced the EBBP with the Affordable Connectivity Program (“ACP”), which utilizes substantially the same terms and conditions as the EBB but with a reduced monthly benefit. We participate in the ACP. To our knowledge we comply with the rules of these subsidy programs. Although we cannot predict whether the FCC will further modify its approach to using USF support to subsidize voice and broadband service to low-income consumers, these subsidies do not represent a material amount of our revenue. 
 E-Rate. We have provided telecommunications services, broadband Internet access services, and internal connections supported by the FCC’s Schools and Libraries Universal Service Support Mechanism (“E-rate”) for many years. E-rate support provides an invaluable means by which elementary and secondary schools can afford those services, particularly in rural and remote, high-cost areas. Historically, E-rate has primarily supported services that connect eligible school buildings. To our knowledge, we comply with applicable E-Rate requirements.
USAC Audit of RHC Program Funding Requests. In addition to the prospective changes to the RHC program discussed above, the FCC and USAC have periodically undertaken reviews of current and past funding requests. In June 2017, we received a letter from USAC’s auditors inquiring about past funding requests in Alaska, all of which were previously approved by USAC. After clarifying the request, and correspondence with USAC we received in February 2020 a draft audit report from USAC that is described more fully in Note 13 “Commitments and Contingencies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The draft audit report alleges violations of the FCC’s rules for establishing rural rates and urban rates, the provisioning and billing of ineligible services and products, and violations of the FCC’s competitive bidding rules. We were invited to comment on this draft audit report and have been engaged since that time in correspondence with USAC with respect to its requests. As a result of these conversations and comments being submitted by us, USAC’s auditors are expected to issue a final audit report incorporating our responses that will be sent to USAC’s Rural Health Care Division to review and determine if corrective action would be appropriate. In the event that we disagree with USAC’s final audit report, we can appeal that decision to USAC’s Rural Health Care Division and/or the FCC. At this time, we cannot predict the contents or timing of the final USAC audit report, the outcome of the audit or the impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. 
FCC Inquiry into Company’s RHC Program Participation. We also received a Letter of Inquiry in March 2018 from the FCC Enforcement Bureau requesting historical information regarding our participation in the FCC’s Rural Health Care program. On November 5, 2019 and January 22, 2021 Alaska Communications received additional letters from the FCC Enforcement Bureau requesting additional information, to which it responded. To date, Alaska Communications has been working with the FCC’s Enforcement to provide it the information it is seeking and has engaged in discussions with respect to the investigation. We continue to work constructively with the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau to provide it the information it is seeking. Any adverse outcome with respect to the FCC Enforcement Bureau’s inquiry may have an adverse impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.
FCC Replace and Remove Program
In November 2019, the FCC adopted a rule prohibiting the use of USF support to purchase or obtain any equipment or services produced or provided by certain companies determined to pose an unacceptable risk to US national security. The rule also prohibits the use of USF funds to maintain, improve, modify, or otherwise support any equipment or services produced or provided by these “covered” companies. In subsequent orders and public notices, the FCC adopted further rules that, among other things, (i) created the “Covered List” of companies whose communications equipment and services have been determined to pose an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States or the security and safety of United States persons; (ii) required eligible telecommunications carriers receiving USF support to replace and remove from their network and operations environments equipment and services included on the Covered List; and (iii) established a Supply Chain Reimbursement Program to allow providers of advanced communications services with 10 million or fewer customers that obtained covered communications equipment and services on or before June 30, 2020, to apply for reimbursement of certain costs reasonably incurred to permanently remove, replace, and dispose of such equipment and services. Separately, the FCC placed Huawei Technologies Company (“Huawei”) and ZTE Corporation 

18



(“ZTE”), and their subsidiaries, parents, and affiliates, on the Covered List. Meanwhile, Congress appropriated $1.9 billion for the Supply Chain Reimbursement Program and enacted a series of laws setting forth further requirements for the Supply Chain Reimbursement Program.
Our Commnet and Viya operating subsidiaries have covered equipment or services in their networks and met the initial eligibility requirements for the Supply Chain Reimbursement Program. In January 2022, all our eligible subsidiaries submitted applications for funding allocations under the program. In July 2022, the FCC announced that the total amount of approved costs for which reimbursement was sought by all applicants was nearly three times in excess of the funding amounts appropriated by Congress. Because demand for program support exceeded available funding, the FCC was required by statute to implement a prioritization scheme and allocate funding on an equal but prorated basis. Accordingly, per its rules, the FCC developed a pro-rata allocation factor of approximately 40%, with the remaining 60% of approved costs for the program without a funding mechanism. 
Congress is considering appropriating additional funding to meet the total demand for reimbursement, but we cannot predict whether or, if so, when or how much such additional funding will be allocated. Thus, we cannot predict whether there will be sufficient available funding to reimburse our subsidiaries for all of their replacement costs. Any shortfall in available funding could have an adverse impact on our ability to replace covered equipment in satisfaction of our regulatory obligations. In addition, despite the severe funding shortfall, the FCC has not changed the aggressive timeline by which companies that were awarded a funding must complete the removal and replacement of their networks. Once funds are allocated, recipients can then draw down funds upon proof of actual expenses incurred by filing a request for the reimbursement of specific expenses, but must submit a request for reimbursement on each application by July 2023 and then must complete all construction for removal and replacement of the Covered Equipment and provide funding requests within a year of their initial funding request. This timeline applies to all participants, regardless of whether a single site or, in the case of our Commnet subsidiary, substantially all of its network, requires replacement. We cannot predict whether and to what extent the FCC or the administrator on which it relies to administer the reimbursement program will approve our subsidiaries’ requests for the specific reimbursement of costs, or whether we can complete our participation in the program on the aggressive timeline set by the FCC, without the need to seek extensions.
Video Services
Video services systems are regulated by the FCC under the Communications Act. We provide video services in the US Virgin Islands. The FCC regulates our programming selection through local broadcast TV station mandatory carriage obligations, constraints on our retransmission consent negotiations with local broadcast TV stations, and limited regulation of our carriage negotiations with cable programming networks. The FCC and federal laws also impose rules governing, among other things, leased cable set-top boxes, our ability to collect and disclose subscribers’ personally identifiable information, access to inside wiring in multiple dwelling units, cable pole attachments, customer service and technical standards, and disability access requirements. Failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to penalties. The FCC is examining whether it should modernize its video regulations and already has updated or eliminated some requirements, but we cannot predict whether and to what extent the FCC will continue to pursue deregulation in this space. To our knowledge, we comply in all material respects with applicable FCC video services requirements.

US State and Territory Regulation
Wireless Services
Federal law generally preempts state and local regulation of the entry of, or the rates charged by, any CMRS provider. For this reason, as a practical matter, we are generally free to establish wireless rates and offer new wireless products and services, and our wireless businesses are subject to minimal state regulatory requirements. However, the states in which we operate maintain nominal oversight jurisdiction. For example, states may regulate the “terms and conditions” of a CMRS provider’s service other than rates. States and localities also assess taxes and fees on wireless carriers.

The location and construction of our wireless transmission towers and antennas are subject to state and local environmental regulation, as well as state or local zoning, land use and other regulation. Before we can put a system into commercial operation or expand a system, we must obtain all necessary zoning and building permit approvals for the cell site and tower locations. The time needed to obtain zoning approvals and requisite permits varies from market to market and state to state. Likewise, variations exist in local zoning processes. If zoning approval or requisite state permits cannot be obtained, or if environmental rules make construction impossible or infeasible on a particular site, our network design might be adversely affected, network design costs could increase, and the service provided to our customers might be limited.
In recent years, the FCC has taken actions to help expedite the deployment of wireless network infrastructure. Those actions include limiting state and local regulations governing the construction or modification of towers and the installation of small cells and other facilities within and outside public rights-of-way when the FCC determines those regulations can be barriers to deployment. Among other things, the FCC established new shorter shot clocks for completion of local reviews of small wireless facility applications and required that fees which states and localities may charge for the location of small cells in rights-of-way must be cost-based. Several of the FCC’s most recent decisions were challenged in court by individual localities and organizations representing local governments. While some of the FCC’s actions have been upheld, others have been vacated or remanded, and others remain subject to petitions for reconsideration or appeal. We cannot predict with certainty the likely timing or outcome of these challenges or their effect on our future wireless deployments. 
Alaska Regulation
Providers of intrastate wireline telecommunication services in Alaska are required to obtain certificates of public convenience and necessity from the Regulatory Commission of Alaska (the “RCA”). In addition, RCA approval is required if an entity acquires a controlling interest in any of our certificated subsidiaries, acquires a controlling interest in another intrastate utility, or discontinues intrastate service. On August 29, 2019, the Governor of Alaska signed into law new legislation that eliminated the requirement for Alaska Communications to maintain RCA-filed tariffs covering rates, terms, and conditions for legacy phone and networking services in Alaska. However, rates, terms, and conditions for basic residential local telephone service must, under the bill, be uniform within each study area. Alaska Communications implemented changes to tariffs, terms and conditions and other service-related policies effective November 27, 2019. 
Alaska Universal Service Fund. The Alaska Universal Service Fund (“AUSF”) complements the federal Universal Service Fund but is focused on obligations to meet intrastate service obligations. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, we received approximately $2.7 million in annual AUSF support. In 2021, the RCA opened a new docket to consider reforms to AUSF support mechanisms, including whether and, if so, when to subset AUSF. The RCA has not yet acted in that docket, and we cannot predict how or whether any action taken by RCA in the proceeding will affect us. 

US Virgin Islands Regulation
Virgin Islands Public Service Commission
Our wireline (i.e., voice, broadband internet, and cable video) operations in the US Virgin Islands are subject to the US Virgin Islands Public Utilities Code, pursuant to which the Virgin Islands Public Service Commission (“PSC”) regulates certain telecommunications and cable TV services that Viya provides in the US Virgin Islands. Among other things, the PSC establishes the rates and fees that we may charge local exchange residential and enterprise customers in the US Virgin Islands for certain wireline telecommunications services. The PSC is required by US Virgin Islands law to review local utility rates every five years. The PSC last adopted an order increasing the rates and fees that we may charge in June 2016, subject to certain conditions and future obligations. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries entered into a transfer of control agreement with the PSC on July 1, 2016, which imposes certain operational and reporting obligations on the Viya companies that do not, by their terms, expire. We believe that we continue to satisfy these requirements. Further, as a condition to Viya’s receipt of federal USF funds from the FCC, the PSC is required to certify on an annual basis that Viya complies with certain eligible telecommunication carrier (“ETC”) obligations. We believe that we comply with all such obligations but cannot predict the outcome of future PSC proceedings relating to Viya’s ETC status.

In December 2022, we filed a Petition for Forbearance with the PSC requesting the PSC to largely deregulate our US Virgin Islands operations. Although we cannot predict the outcome or timing for this proceeding, if the PSC approves the Petition, we will be subject to substantially less regulation in the US Virgin Islands, which we believe will provide a material benefit to our wireline telecommunications operations and competitiveness there. 
Our subsidiaries provide cable TV service in the US Virgin Islands pursuant to two franchises granted by the PSC. Each franchise was renewed in July 2015 by an order issued by the PSC, but the PSC has not yet issued new franchise agreements memorializing these renewals. Since then, the FCC has placed some limits on the powers of local cable franchising authorities such as the PSC, including limits on their ability to impose franchise fees and to regulate non-cable services. We cannot predict what requirements will be included by the PSC in any renewal franchise agreements, when such renewal franchise agreements will be executed, or how the FCC’s past or future actions concerning cable franchising will impact the PSC’s preparation of the agreements. We understand that the renewed franchise agreements will likely contain substantially similar terms and conditions as the prior franchise agreements, including a 15-year term, but that the agreements will exclude prior language permitting the PSC to regulate our cable rates.
Virgin Islands Research and Technology Park
Our video, internet, and wireless companies in the US Virgin Islands also receive tax benefits as qualifying participants in the US Virgin Islands’ Research & Technology Park (“RTPark”) program. RTPark was chartered with the goal of promoting technology-based economic development in the territory and offering attractive economic incentives to companies that contribute to the development of the US Virgin Islands through local employment and sourcing, as well as significant contributions to both the economy and the non-profit sectors of the community. As part of the program, our participating entities currently receive a 100% tax exemption applied against gross receipts, property, and excise taxes as well as a 90% exemption against income taxes and a reduction in customs duties from 6% to 1%. These benefits resulted in tax exemptions of approximately $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. In order to qualify, we are required to maintain certain capital investments over the first five years of the agreement, pay monthly management fees of 0.4% of tenant company revenue, make annual charitable contributions to the University of the Virgin Islands, purchase products and services locally when feasible and provide in-kind services to RTPark.
Guyana Regulation
Our subsidiary, GTT Inc. (“GTT”), in which we hold an 80% interest, is subject to regulation in Guyana under the provisions of GTT’s License from the Government of Guyana, the Guyana Public Utilities Commission Act of 2016 as amended (or “PUC Law”) and the Guyana Telecommunications Act of 2016 (or “Telecommunications Law”). The Public Utilities Commission of Guyana (or “PUC”) is an independent statutory body with the principal responsibility for regulating telecommunications rates and services in Guyana. The Ministry of Telecommunications, an agency of the Government of Guyana, has formal authority over telecommunications licensing and related issues. The Telecommunications Agency (or “TA”) advises and makes recommendations to the Minister of Telecommunications, implements policy and has principal responsibility for operating licenses and frequency authorizations.
Licenses. GTT provides domestic fixed (both wireline and wireless) and international voice and data services in Guyana pursuant to licenses from the Government of Guyana granting GTT the right to provide a variety of domestic fixed services (both wireline and wireless) and international voice and data services. These licenses were issued in October 2020. Pursuant to the licenses, GTT also provides mobile wireless telephone service in Guyana.
PUC Law and Telecommunications Law. The PUC Law and the Telecommunications Law, and related regulations adopted in October 2020, provide the general framework for the regulation of telecommunications services in Guyana. As a general matter, the PUC has authority to regulate GTT’s domestic and international telecommunications services and rates and to require GTT to supply certain technical, administrative and financial information as it may request and as stipulated by the regulations. The Telecommunications Agency has broad authority to review GTT’s programs for development and expansion of facilities or services. For a description of recent actions of the PUC, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.

Regulatory Developments. On October 5, 2020, the Prime Minister of Guyana formally implemented telecommunications legislation previously passed by the Guyana Parliament in 2016 that introduces material changes to many features of Guyana’s existing telecommunications regulatory regime with the intention of creating a more competitive market. At that time, we were issued a new license to provide domestic and international voice as well as data services and mobile services in Guyana. Two of our competitors were issued service licenses as well. While we have requested details of our competitors’ licenses, such information has not been made public by the Guyana Telecommunications Agency, and we are not yet able to ascertain whether the licenses issued to our competitors permit competitors to provide services that have been subject to GTT’s exclusive rights contained in its 1990 license. 
On October 23, 2020, the Government of Guyana also brought into effect new telecommunications regulations called for by the telecommunications legislation. The regulations include new requirements for the market as a whole, which impact our operations, administrative reporting and services. There can be no assurance that these regulations will be effectively implemented, or that they will be administered in a fair and transparent manner.
The PUC has currently implemented fixed and mobile termination rates that came into effect on February 1, 2023. GTT has also advocated for changes to the Quality-of-Service standards noted in the regulations. GTT has put forward recommendations in keeping with regional best practices and benchmarks and is awaiting the final determination on that submission from the PUC.

Bermuda Regulation
The Regulatory Authority of Bermuda (the “RA”) is the primary regulator of our operations in Bermuda. The relevant legislation is the Regulatory Authority Act 2011 and the Electronic Communications Act 2011. Pursuant to these statutes, the RA is responsible for regulating all electronic communications services in Bermuda, including the broadband, mobile and video services we offer. The statutory framework provides the RA powers in respect of licensing, consumer protections, ex post competition issues, and the identification and remedying of significant market power concerns.
On September 1, 2020, the RA completed its second market review and continued its determination we have significant market power in certain broadband and mobile services. As a consequence, we are subject to a series of ex-ante remedies that include wholesale obligations, price caps, accounting separation and reporting obligations in addition to the ex-post competition rules that generally apply. The ex-ante remedies are burdensome and require financial, operational, legal and regulatory resources be allocated to ensure compliance. The next market review for the electronic communications section by the RA is required to commence and conclude during 2023-2024.
Cayman Regulation
The Utility Regulation and Competition Office of the Cayman Islands (“OfReg”) is the primary regulator of our operations in the Cayman Islands. The relevant legislation is the Information & Communications Technology Act (2019 Revision). Pursuant to this statute, OfReg is responsible for the regulation and licensing of telecommunications, broadcasting and all forms of radio in the Cayman Islands, including the broadband and television services we offer. The statutory framework provides OfReg powers in respect of licensing, infrastructure sharing, advertising guidelines, competition issues, and the identification and remedying of significant market power concerns.
