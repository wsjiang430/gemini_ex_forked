BUSINESS
Overview
We are a health technology company, and our mission is to empower people to live their healthiest lives. Digital transformation has revolutionized nearly every industry to create new, consumer-first experiences that are both personalized and empowering. We seek to usher in a new era in healthcare, what we call Healthcare 2.0, to transform how acute and chronic conditions are diagnosed and managed. 
We are helping pioneer this healthcare digital transformation, beginning with diagnostics. We started from consumer-centric principles and designed our proprietary platform, the Cue Integrated Care Platform, with a relentless focus on user experience, convenience, and accuracy, with the goal of enabling people to make quicker, better-informed healthcare decisions. The Cue Integrated Care Platform consists of multiple hardware, software, and diagnostic components: (1) our revolutionary, proprietary Cue Health Monitoring System, made up of a portable, durable and reusable reader, or Cue Reader; a single-use test cartridge, or Cue Cartridge; and a sample collection wand, or Cue Wand; (2) our Cue Data and Innovation Layer, with cloud-based data and analytics capabilities; (3) our Cue Virtual Care Delivery Apps, including our consumer-friendly Cue Health App, the clinician-facing Cue Clinic, and our Cue Enterprise Dashboard; and (4) our Cue Ecosystem Integrations and Apps, including integration with: electronic medical record, or EMR, systems (enabling seamless connection between a clinician, their EMR, and Cue’s diagnostics); pharmacies and last-mile delivery (enabling electronic prescription, or e-Rx, and on-demand delivery), clinician networks (enabling virtual care and prescription), and laboratories (enabling mail-in panel testing).
Our platform has been designed to work seamlessly to deliver and manage health data both within the healthcare system and within the home. Through our application programming interfaces, or APIs, our platform has been engineered so that it can be directly integrated into existing workflows and on-demand services, such as telemedicine, e-Rx services, and EMR systems. For example, we implemented an integration with one of the U.S.’s leading EMR systems on behalf of one of our customers, a leading healthcare system, to enable a seamless workflow from test ordering to test results, with our mobile app and the Cue Health Monitoring System. But beyond designing our platform to be able to integrate within the traditional healthcare system, we have built our platform to enable fast, frequent, lab-quality diagnostics by anyone, anywhere, intended to facilitate a new continuous care model of personalized and contextualized healthcare. Our first commercially available diagnostic test for use with our Cue Health Monitoring System is our Cue COVID-19 Test Kit, which has been authorized by two Emergency Use Authorizations, or EUAs, from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, or the FDA, for point-of-care and over-the-counter and at-home use, an Interim Order authorization from Health Canada, regulatory approval from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (“CDSCO”), and authorization from Singapore Health Sciences Authority. Users can run

a COVID-19 test anywhere using the Cue Reader and a Cue COVID-19 Test Kit, and have lab-quality test results delivered digitally to the user’s mobile smart device in about 20 minutes. 
The launch of Cue Care marks the full realization of the Cue Integrated Care Platform: empowering individuals to test themselves from the comfort of their homes, consult with a clinician in real-time, and receive treatment within a matter of hours. We believe this innovation represents a fundamental principal for the future of healthcare. When we launched Cue Care in August 2022, users could connect with a virtual care provider within the Cue Health App about their COVID-19 test results. If medically indicated, that user could receive an e-prescription for anti-viral medication, which could then be delivered the same day. Soon after the initial launch of Cue Care, we expanded the Cue Care experience to allow users to upload any COVID-19 test result (including non-Cue test results, such as from an antigen test) and third-party urinary tract infection and influenza test results to go through the same virtual care and e-prescription process.
In February 2023, we further expanded our Cue Care capabilities and our product line by launching the sale of thirteen (13) at-home test kits, allowing users to test for certain general health and wellness conditions, making it easier for people to take control of their health using actionable information. Through this new feature, individuals with a wide range of health concerns, such as sexual health, heart health, and food sensitivities, can order an at-home panel test kit through the Cue Health App or on our website, receive one or more sample collection kits, collect their sample, and mail their sample to one of our independent, CLIA-certified, diagnostic lab partners using an enclosed, self-addressed stamped envelope. After processing by the lab, the user’s easy-to-understand results are securely delivered back to the customer in the Cue Health App, along with educational materials about their condition or concern. The user can then choose to consult virtually with a healthcare provider via Cue Care to receive personalized care and treatment delivered quickly. The new Cue Health at-home test kits now cover the following: 
Heart Health Test Kits
· Heart Health Panel
· Cardiac Risk Apo A+B Test
Sexual Health Test Kits
· Chlamydia and Gonorrhea
· Herpes Panel
· Men’s Sexual Health Panel
· Women’s Sexual Health Panel
Women’s Health Test Kits
· Women's Fertility Panel
· Women's Health Panel 
Metabolic Health Test Kits
· Liver Panel
· Kidney Panel 
Wellness Test Kits
· Food Sensitivity Panel
· Colon Cancer Screening 
· Vitamin D Test
While our new at-home test kits and other Cue Health App features allow users to access a greater variety of tests and information about their health, we continue to develop our own test kits for use with the Cue Health Monitoring System. Though as of March 15, 2023 the Cue COVID-19 Test Kit (authorized under EUA) is our only commercially available test kit for use with our Cue Reader, and our future tests remain subject to technical development, clinical studies and regulatory authorization, clearance or approval, we have four additional test kits that are currently under review by the FDA (COVID-19 de novo, Flu de novo, Flu + COVID-19 EUA, and mpox EUA), we have finished our clinical studies for RSV, and have begun our clinical studies for Strep Throat and Chlamydia + Gonorrhea, (swab collection method) – all of which will use the Cue Reader. We also have one test kit in late-stage technical development (Chlamydia + Gonorrhea (urine collection method)).
Our goal has always been to build a broad platform that would reinvent how we interact with our health. Since our early days, we developed our platform to be able to address the majority of diagnostic tests routinely conducted in clinical laboratories because we believe that users will not only demand a simple, personalized, convenient and connected solution but 
Table of Contents

also a single platform to address their healthcare needs. Our focus is on creating experiences with the user at the center, enabling high satisfaction, measurable health outcomes, and more cost-effective care for the entire ecosystem. 
We believe our platform will allow us to continue to develop and commercialize new tests quickly and scale rapidly, driven by our flexible technology and our in-house, vertically-integrated and automated manufacturing facilities. Our platform has the potential to perform a variety of different tests by accommodating different sample types, including saliva, blood, urine , and detecting nucleic acids, small molecules, proteins or cells. Because we developed our manufacturing facilities and processes in tandem with our technology, we were able to scale our production using fully automated production pods. A production pod is a free standing, modular environmentally-controlled structure containing an automated test cartridge production line. Additionally, we produce our critical biochemistry in-house, including enzymes, antibodies and primers for our Cue Cartridges. 
Our Solution 
Our Cue Integrated Care Platform is simple, fast, and accurate. Our Platform is designed to harness the power of the cloud and provide consumers and enterprises with real-time access to their data and the broader healthcare ecosystem as part of our planned end-to-end solution. Development of the Cue Integrated Care Platform is guided by our focus on the user, whether that be a clinician in a provider office or an individual at home, with a simple goal of enabling users to have reliable information at their fingertips to make faster and more informed healthcare decisions and receive the treatment they need when they need it most. The Cue Integrated Care Platform consists of the following hardware and software components. 
Cue Health Monitoring System
The Cue Health Monitoring System consists of our Cue Reader and a Cue Test Kit. Each Cue Test Kit is comprised of a Cue Cartridge and a Cue Wand. The Cue Reader is an elegantly designed, automated analyzer of test results and is used with Cue Test Kits and the Cue Health App. The Cue Reader contains all the circuitry necessary to process, analyze, and communicate test results digitally, including encrypted Bluetooth radio communication and other sensors. The Cue Reader runs the Cue Cartridge and communicates the result of the test digitally via Bluetooth to the Cue Health App. The Cue Reader is easy to set-up and use and is designed to be universally compatible with our current and planned future Cue Test Kits. The Cue Cartridge is a sample-specific, single-use cartridge designed to handle different chemistries. Each Cue Cartridge contains the specific reagents and associated materials required to detect the target of the particular test and is designed with ease-of-use, user safety, and scalability in mind. The Cue Wand is a single-use and sterile sample collection device designed to permit collection of multiple sample types, including saliva, blood, and urine, with only minor modification. When a Cue Wand is inserted into the associated Cue Cartridge the system automatically runs the test and delivers the result to our Cue Health App.
Cue Data and Innovation Layer
Our cloud-native Cue Data and Innovation Layer stores and curates the data from our Cue Health Monitoring System and provides a secure environment for users to access current and historical health data. Our Data and Innovation Layer has the ability to collate unstructured and structured data from a wide variety of data sources, including data from Cue’s mail-in test kits, which gives us the ability to store and analyze more holistic sets of health data, including from other testing modalities and wearables. The Cue Data and Innovation Layer provides the foundation for our Cue Virtual Care Delivery Apps and has enabled the development of our Cue Ecosystem Integrations and Apps. The Cue Data and Innovation Layer currently contains an API that allows for the data from tests performed on the Cue Health Monitoring System to be received, stored, and retrieved by the end user and for mail-in test kit results to be received on the Cue Health App. For enterprises deploying the Cue Enterprise Dashboard, the Cue Data and Innovation Layer enables the creation of a network of users affiliated by roles with the enterprise. Within this network of users, the Cue Data and Innovation Layer provides the engine behind test analytics, creation of groups, scheduling and compliance, reporting, and enterprise-specific privacy policy management. The Cue Data and Innovation Layer powers the EMR integration with major EMR providers.
Cue Virtual Care Delivery Apps and Cue Care
Our Cue Virtual Care Delivery Apps consist of the Cue Health App, Cue Clinic, and the Cue Enterprise Dashboard. Together, the Cue Health App and Cue Clinic are the two front-end applications that comprise Cue Care. Cue Care is the marketed term for the combination of virtual care delivery apps (the consumer-facing Cue Health App and the clinician-facing Cue Clinic app), services and integrations that power the clinician-consumer interactions such as video calls, secure messaging, prescription ordering, test ordering, and medication delivery. As most healthcare journeys begin with diagnosis, the Cue Health App first provides the interface to run a Cue Test Kit on the Cue Reader or to receive results of a mail-in, at-home test. The Cue Health App creates a secure interface between the user and their health data. For consumers, it allows a single point of entry for 
Table of Contents

their health data and to receive virtual care and treatment; for healthcare professionals, Cue Clinic is designed to provide a unified platform for managing patient histories and allows for telemedicine and e-prescription services through the Cue Ecosystem of Integration and Apps.
The Cue Enterprise Dashboard is designed to allow enterprises, payors, healthcare providers and public health entities to manage population health at the organizational level and has the potential to track the efficiency of various population health programs. Accessible online, the Cue Enterprise Dashboard has the potential to help organizations manage a patient’s journey from onboarding to scheduling, care management and inventory management. Powered by our analytics engine and role-based access capabilities, it is designed to provide chief medical officers, environmental health and safety officials, and benefits managers with insight into their organization’s population health, helping to facilitate decision making.
Cue Ecosystem Integrations and Apps
By securely connecting our Cue Data and Innovation Layer with on-demand services, such as telemedicine and e-prescription services, and integrating with wearable technology, we believe we will enable a truly digital and seamless user experience. In the future, we plan on enhancing our platform to enable additional third-party application development and offerings that complement our solutions. In addition, our ability to integrate with anchor EMR systems, such as Epic Systems Corporation, or Epic, allows our customers to integrate our platform with their existing systems, creating an agile and responsive workflow for patient monitoring for ongoing care, better intelligence and reporting, and more efficient provider-level health management.
Our Underlying Diagnostic Technology for Cue Test Kits
Once a test sample is collected via the Cue Wand and inserted into the Cue Cartridge, the test automatically begins. Depending on the type of Cue Cartridge, our platform uses either a nucleic acid amplification tests (“NAAT”) or immunoassay to perform a test. In both cases, an internal or process control confirms proper assay execution including, as relevant, sample analysis, amplification, sample flow and assay reagent function. Once the assay begins, all heating, mixing, amplification and detection takes place within the Cue Cartridge with no steps by the user. The Cue Reader then communicates the test result digitally, directly, and wirelessly to the Cue Virtual Care Delivery Apps. 
Our Testing Technologies 
Molecular Tests
Molecular tests, also known as NAAT, target genetic material (DNA or RNA) in order to detect a broad range of infectious diseases, and are considered to be the most reliable for this purpose. Polymerase Chain Reaction (“PCR”) and isothermal amplification are two types of molecular testing techniques. The Centers for Disease Control, or CDC, has described molecular tests as the “gold standard” for clinical diagnostic detection of COVID-19. Our COVID-19 Test Kit was the first molecular diagnostic test authorized for at-home and over-the-counter use without physician supervision or a prescription. For infectious diseases, molecular tests are more sensitive than antigen tests and have been recommended by the CDC as the preferred testing technology. 
Immunoassay Tests
Immunoassays are widely used in clinical care. In clinical laboratories, the most common immunoassay technique is the Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay, or ELISA, which is a fundamental clinical diagnostic methodology for detecting and quantifying a wide range of analytes and is one of the main modern lab techniques employed by central labs for a variety of clinical applications. Our ability to perform ELISA-like chemistry within the same cartridge structure we use to run our molecular tests enables us to detect and quantify the biomarkers necessary to expand our care offerings for use cases, including in cardiometabolic health (cholesterol, inflammation, HbA1c), men’s health (testosterone, prostate specific antigen), women’s health (pregnancy, fertility), other cardiac care (troponin, brain natriuretic peptide), wellness (vitamin D), and other tests. 
Strategic Collaborations and Certain Other Agreements

•BARDA
We have partnered with the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, since June 2018, initially focusing on a molecular influenza test using the Cue Health Monitoring System pursuant to a contract that was originally effective through January 2021 and that provided $14.0 million in base funding. In March 2020, BARDA exercised an option to accelerate development, validation and FDA clearance of our COVID-19 test for a $13.7 million award. This funding enabled us to accelerate the development and validation of our COVID-19 test. In May 2020, our original contract with BARDA was amended to increase the base value from $14.0 million to $21.8 million and to extend the contract term to January 2023. Pursuant to our agreement with BARDA, we agreed to provide regular reports to BARDA regarding our progress and certain customary oversight provisions. BARDA can terminate this agreement for convenience or if we fail to meet our obligations, subject to our opportunity to cure such defaults. Furthermore, in January 2022, the scope of our partnership with BARDA was increased to include our development of an Omicron-Genotyping COVID-19 test to be used in professional point-of-care settings. In December 2022, the existing contract was further amended to extend the period of performance to June 2023.
•Minnesota Department of Health
In December 2022, we announced that we had been selected by Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) to provide a statewide COVID-19 telehealth to treatment program, powered by Cue Care, at no cost to Minnesota residents. Through this program, Minnesotans who test positive for COVID-19 on any self test can consult virtually with a healthcare professional through the Cue Care platform to obtain a prescription for COVID-19 treatment, if medically indicated, and at no cost to that individual. The COVID-19 treatment can be made available for same-day pick-up or delivery. Minnesotans can access Cue Care for this service via a mobile smart device, web, or telephone, which allows for greater access to care. In February 2023, the contract was extended through June 2024.
Google
In April 2021, the Company and Google LLC entered into an agreement to provide Cue Readers and Cue COVID-19 Test Kits to Google's employees through year end 2021. In November 2021, this agreement was renewed through June 30, 2022. Under the renewed agreement, Google’s employees were given access to proctoring services. In June 2022 the contract was renewed through December 31, 2022 and in December 2022, it was renewed through June 30, 2023. 
In August 2021, the Company and Google Cloud entered into a partnership to accelerate the development of a secure real-time COVID-19 variant tracking and sequencing solution. The partnership is intended to create an advanced respiratory biothreat detection system spanning from the Company's at-home diagnostic testing to full real-time viral sequencing as well as analytical and predictive capability using Google Cloud powered solutions.
Mayo Clinic 
In November 2020, we established a commercial relationship with the Mayo Clinic to supply Cue COVID-19 Test Kits for use at the Mayo Clinic following an independent clinical validation of our COVID-19 test by the Mayo Clinic. We entered into a purchase agreement with the Mayo Clinic under which they may purchase the Cue Health Monitoring System and Cue COVID-19 Test Kits on a purchase order basis. The purchase agreement has an initial one-year term and provides for automatic one-year renewals thereafter, unless the agreement is earlier terminated in accordance with its terms.
In April 2021, we entered into a collaboration agreement with the Mayo Clinic in which the Mayo Clinic agreed to identify us, to employers, hospitals and other U.S. clients, as a preferred partner for providing clinical diagnostic testing using our Cue Health Monitoring System, and we agreed to identify the Mayo Clinic as a preferred partner for lab and advisory services, and we jointly agreed to work together to develop go-to-market strategies for clinical diagnostic testing services. The collaboration agreement has a three-year term, unless it is earlier terminated in accordance with its terms.
Our Growth Strategy
Key elements of our growth strategy include:
•Expand our menu of tests and continue to innovate and enhance our platform. We continue to expand our test menu using at-home, mail-in test kits and we plan to expand Cue’s test menu for tests that use the Cue Reader, including in the fields of respiratory health, sexual health, cardiac and metabolic health, women's health, men's health, and chronic disease management, with several of these tests having been submitted for FDA authorization and clearance during 
Table of Contents

2022. Our broad planned future test menu is aimed to appeal to consumers, employers, healthcare providers and health plans alike and will allow for care that can be personalized to the consumer. We launched Cue Care, our same-day, at-home, test-to-treatment solution in August 2022. Customers that test positive for COVID-19, urinary tract infection, or receive test results through our mail-in test kits can now use our platform to consult with a healthcare professional and if necessary, arrange for prescription delivery. We intend to continue to expand our platform capabilities to provide a comprehensive user experience. 
•Drive ecosystem adoption. We have been successful in integrating our platform into existing enterprise-level health management systems, allowing customers to automate workflows while allowing us to garner long-term commercial partnerships. As we enhance our Cue Integrated Care Platform, we intend to extend our integrations with leading EMR systems and to build-out additional capabilities to integrate with telemedicine and digital health providers, e-prescription, e-commerce, and other connected services, to offer consumers a frictionless, virtual-to-physical care solution that positions them for better outcomes
•Continue to expand our installed base and distribution network to enable pull-through of our future extended care offerings. We believe that the ability of customers to experience our platform for COVID-19 testing will facilitate market adoption and awareness that will benefit us as we continue to expand our test menu. COVID-19 has served as an accelerant for increasing the installed base of our customers, which we believe will drive demand to try our additional tests in development. We have significant interest from individuals, enterprises, and healthcare providers in our future test menu. In 2021, we rolled out our direct-to-consumer offering, providing retail customers the ability to purchase Cue products directly through our app and website. We further plan to leverage our installed base, established distribution network, and direct customer relationship through our Cue Health App to drive sales of our future test menu.
•Increase adoption through value-based selling and payor reimbursement. Our platform enables enterprise customers and payors to capture consistent, convenient and simple diagnostic information to inform key decisions. We believe this will help create positive outcomes for all stakeholders, especially our customers, as we expand our test menu. For example, helping customers test their HbA1c through use of our at-home, mail-in test kits to manage diabetes to determine whether their treatment plan is effective would help payors and enterprises incur fewer costs. We believe this strategy will help accelerate our growth and drive further adoption of our platform.
•Continue to build the Cue brand. We believe that there are significant opportunities to drive increased brand awareness, educate consumers and enterprises on the benefits of diagnostics and our connected health platform, and build a lasting consumer brand. As we continue to invest in marketing, we anticipate that many customers who are not aware of our platform or the benefits of continuous, virtual care will begin using our platform. We further intend to increase our brand awareness through our partnership program. We believe the validation of leading institutions, such as the Mayo Clinic, the NBA and others, will help us to become the testing solution of choice in the enterprise and employer, travel, sports and entertainment, education, personal health and wellness, community and population health, and government market.
•Expand our global footprint. We believe in the broad suitability of our platform and intend to grow our international customer base. In countries with developed healthcare systems, our value proposition is similar to that of the United States and will offer individuals, enterprises, and healthcare providers with the ability to positively impact health outcomes. In December 2020, our COVID-19 test received the CE mark, clearing it for sale and distribution in the European Union. In April 2021, we received Interim Order authorization from Health Canada to be able to sell and distribute our COVID-19 test and in August 2021 such Interim Order authorization was amended to include both point-of-care and self-testing. In countries with underdeveloped healthcare systems and infrastructure, we believe our platform will be able to provide front-line healthcare providers with access to lab-quality testing to better diagnose and treat underserved patient populations. In June 2021, our COVID-19 test received regulatory approval from the CDSCO for professional point-of-care use in India. In November 2021, we received authorization in Singapore from the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) for the Cue COVID-19 Test under the Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR).
Clinical Results
In January 2021, Mayo Clinic Laboratories published the results of an independent clinical validation study that evaluated the clinical performance of our COVID-19 test in Diagnostic Microbiology & Infection Disease, a leading peer-reviewed scientific and medical journal in the fields of clinical microbiology and the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases. The study was performed using lower nasal swabs and the results were compared to a reference central laboratory NAAT in 292 symptomatic and asymptomatic adults who were referred for COVID-19 testing in a community drive though 
Table of Contents

collection setting operated by the Mayo Clinic. The study protocol was approved by the Mayo Clinical Institutional Review Board. The samples were collected in August 2020. Patient health status was not collected at the time of testing. The study concluded that Cue COVID-19 test was both sensitive and specific compared to central laboratory testing and that the Cue COVID-19 test for SARS-CoV-2 can be considered a feasible solution to implement at sites requiring a point-of-care solution.
The reference panel testing of 206 patients was conducted using the Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay on a Hologic Panther instrument and the reference panel testing of 85 patients was conducted using the Mayo Clinic laboratory for testing by a RT-PCR testing on the Roche Light Cycle 480. The primary outcome was positive and negative percent agreement between the Cue COVID-19 test and the laboratory tests. The Mayo Clinic used a tie-breaker method for any sample with positive result by the laboratory test but a negative test result by the Cue COVID-19 test. If the patient had received testing by more than one reference method within 14 days of study enrollment, the tie-breaker system referred the reference result to be the result obtained by two of the three methods (Cue, Hologic Aptima and laboratory-development RT-PCR). The study did not have a method for resolving all discrepant results observed and an incorrect reference method result cannot be ruled out. It was also not possible to perform a formal limit of detection study due to the design of the assay at that time. Invalid or cancelled results were not able to be retested as directed by the instructions in the Cue COVID-19 test because study participants left the facility before point-of-care testing was completed.
The overall concordance between our COVID-19 test and the reference laboratory test was 97.8%. The positive test agreement between our COVID-19 test and the reference test was 91.7% (22/24) and 95.7% (22/23) when one patient with no tie-breaker method was excluded. The negative test agreement was 98.4% (239/243). There were 25 (8.6%) invalid or cancelled results. Since the time of the study, we have lowered the cut-off value for the internal control that detects the presence of human cellular material in the nasal sample such that 12 invalid results obtained during the study would now return a concordant negative result, and with this change there would have been 13 invalid or cancelled results.
The Mayo Clinic study concluded that the Cue COVID-19 Test Kit using a lower nasal swab collection method is accurate and is both sensitive and specific compared to central laboratory testing using an NPS collection. Additionally, the study noted the Cue COVID-19 Test Kit is easy to use with minimal training or previous laboratory testing experience.
In March 2021, the FDA issued an EUA for the Cue COVID-19 Test Kit for at-home and over-the-counter use without a prescription or physician supervision, making it the first molecular diagnostic test to receive such authorization. In September 2020, the FDA required us to evaluate the analytical limit of detection and to assess the traceability of our COVID-19 test with FDA reference materials. Between December 2020 and February 2021, we conducted prospective studies at four urgent care locations and at two of our own locations to evaluate the use of the Cue COVID-19 Test Kit for at-home and over-the-counter use by lay users in a simulated home use environment. Adult lay users (≥18 years of age) self-collected or collected from their child (<18 years of age) a Cue Wand nasal swab and ran the test. Adult and child subjects were enrolled in an “all comers” style at the urgent care locations. A total of 286 subjects were enrolled: 276 adults self-swabbing and self-testing to run the Cue COVID-19 Test Kit for at-home and over-the-counter use and 10 children where their parent collected the nasal sample and ran the Cue COVID-19 Test Kit.
There were 38 subjects who tested positive for COVID-19, 233 subjects who tested negative for COVID-19 and 2 subjects with inconclusive results by the FDA Emergency Use Authorized molecular comparator method. Among the subjects, 10 subjects were asymptomatic positive, 123 subjects were asymptomatic negative, and 1 subject was asymptomatic inconclusive by the comparator. In this clinical study, our COVID-19 test correctly identified 96% (27/28) of positive samples from individuals known to have symptoms and correctly identified 100% (10/10) of positive samples from individuals without symptoms. Our COVID-19 test correctly identified 99.1% (231/233) of negative samples. Additionally, in September 2020, we submitted a post-market clinical data report to the FDA as required under our EUA, which included results from the Mayo Clinic's evaluation of Cue versus an institutional reference panel.
Regulatory Status of the Cue COVID-19 Test Kit
In June 2020, the FDA granted us an EUA for our COVID-19 test for point of care use under the supervision of qualified medical personnel. In March 2021, the FDA granted us an additional EUA for over-the-counter and at-home use of our COVID-19 test without a prescription. Our COVID-19 test is authorized for use by both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, and by adults and children aged two and older with adult assistance. While commercial sales of our Cue COVID-19 Test Kit are authorized pursuant to our EUA authorizations, to date we have not obtained a 510(k) clearance for our Cue COVID-19 Test Kit, which clearance would be required in the event that the FDA terminates or revokes our EUAs. 
In May 2022, we made a submission to the FDA for full clearance of our molecular COVID-19 test for at-home and point-of-care use.
Table of Contents

Other Regulatory Status
In September 2022, we prepared a de novo submission to the FDA for full clearance of the Cue Flu Molecular Test for at-home and point-of-care use. FDA clearance of Cue’s test would provide the public an at-home and POC molecular flu test that has been fully reviewed by the FDA.
In September 2022, we submitted an EUA application with the FDA for our Cue Flu + COVID-19 Molecular Test for at-home and point-of-care use.
In January 2023, we submitted an EUA application with the FDA for our mpox Test for point-of-care use.
Marketing 
Our marketing strategy is focused on continuing to build strong brand awareness for the Cue Integrated Care Platform as a next-generation healthcare solution, with relevant, measurable value for all of our customer segments. Our marketing drives across our owned media channels (website and social networks), press releases, scientific publications, industry engagement with key stakeholders, partnerships with key opinion and market leaders, and targeted marketing through digital and non-digital channels. We anticipate using account-based marketing strategies to accelerate brand awareness and increase demand, and thus sales opportunities, across our targeted markets. 
Sales
Our direct sales team engages with prospective clients and seeks to identify the best sales channel based on each client’s needs. Our go-to-market strategy is focused on allowing us access to the end user, through our Cue Integrated Care Platform, even if the individual was acquired via our direct sales organization or through an outside sales channel. For example, if an individual obtained a Cue Health Monitoring System through their self-insured employer's COVID-19 return-to-work efforts or as a result of government-supported distribution, we can nonetheless directly engage with the end user through the Cue Health App and potentially convert them to using our at-home, mail-in test kits as well as planned future Cue Test Kits, lifestyle medications, and other products we may develop. As a result, we expect that we will be able to fulfill market demand through our internal and external sales channels, while maintaining an important direct relationship for our product enhancements and care offerings. 
Our direct sales team is comprised of experienced sales professionals focused on the following four categories:
•Enterprise Sales: Our enterprise sales strategy identifies major self-insured enterprises, such as Fortune 500 companies with large-covered employee populations, as well as small to medium sized businesses with healthcare plans partners and employee benefits offerings. We believe that enterprise customers will want to utilize our integrated care solutions for their employees and their families, both on-premise and at-home. 
•Healthcare Provider Sales: Our healthcare provider sales strategy targets major healthcare systems and healthcare professionals such as hospital systems, private clinics and concierge health systems, and physicians’ offices. Relationships with our customers help validate our platform, and we believe will help accelerate marketplace adoption of our products. Our products are available direct or through major healthcare distributors including, Cardinal, McKesson, Henry Schein, and Medline.
•Direct-to-Consumer Sales: Our direct-to-consumer sales strategy identifies opportunities through online and offline retail channels such as e-commerce and future opportunities for in-store sales.
•Public Sector Sales: Our public sector sales strategy identifies new opportunities within federal, state and local government agencies. While we expect that revenue from other categories of customers will become a larger component of revenue over time, our public sector sales strategy continues to look to identify opportunities with new and existing federal, state and local government agency customers.
We believe focused efforts on each of our customer categories is critical given the unique role each plays in the healthcare ecosystem, the total size of their respective addressable markets and the potential benefits that each receive from our platform.

Research and Development
The primary focus of our research and development effort has evolved over time. The work to get certain of our tests into the late-stage technical development phase for the general immunoassay modality and certain specific immunoassays (including fertility, pregnancy, and inflammation) was largely complete prior to a shift of our focus in mid-2018. At that time, we refocused our efforts on improving the NAAT modality within our platform and completing our first automated production line, initially used to build Cue Cartridges for research and development purposes. The primary target within NAAT from mid-2018 was respiratory infectious disease testing, in particular, influenza. The focus on influenza (which also helped advance our very similar RSV test) lasted until COVID-19 came to the forefront in early 2020. Research and development efforts shifted fully to developing our COVID-19 test in March of 2020 when our clinical study sites for influenza were closed to those with respiratory illness symptoms due to the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 remained our focus through most of 2020. Starting in early 2021, we began to shift our research and development efforts to finalizing our tests in late-stage technical development and restarting development on tests in earlier stages. In 2022, we focused our efforts in order to make our de novo submissions for full clearance of the COVID-19 Molecular Test, Cue Flu Molecular Test, and submit EUA applications with the FDA for our Cue Flu + COVID-19 Molecular Test and mpox Test. We also invested in advancing our tests for RSV, chlamydia + gonorrhea and strep throat, bringing them to the clinical study stage.
Despite the evolving focus of our research and development efforts, we continue to focus on developing gold-standard diagnostic science that seamlessly integrates with a connected, end-to-end digital platform. Our platform was developed over a ten-year period in our San Diego, California facilities. All of our core technology, including the chemistry, the Cue Reader and Cue Cartridge design, the Cue Health App and Cue Enterprise Dashboard is proprietary and primarily developed in-house by us. 
Our research and development team, which includes our clinical and reagent production team members, is responsible for the design, functionality and quality of our products and services. Our team is interdisciplinary in nature, including scientists, statisticians, chemists, engineers and regulatory experts.
Vertically-Integrated Manufacturing Solutions 
Our manufacturing facilities were developed alongside our science and technology and are vertically-integrated, fully automated and scalable. Our integrated manufacturing and bioproduction gives us complete control over the quality of our finished product.
We own and control the intellectual property that makes the platform possible. Our manufacturing process is replicable, and our manufacturing production pods can produce any type of test in our expected future test menu. We believe our manufacturing capabilities are differentiated and allow us not only to scale quickly and efficiently, but also to adapt our production quickly to market demands or evolving consumer needs. 
We produce our Cue Cartridges in-house, including critical enzymes, antibodies, and primers for the test cartridges. We have complete production oversight and quality control over finished products and insulation from global fluctuations in supply chain and costs. We achieve this by manufacturing all of our Cue Cartridges in our state-of-the-art facilities in San Diego, California using our modular, scalable production pods. Our fully automated production pods build raw components into fully assembled, packaged cartridges. 
Our Cue Readers are manufactured by our partners. Our Cue Wands are manufactured by us or our partners. For our Cue Readers and Cue Wands, we own and control all of the intellectual property developed by us and rely on multiple suppliers. 
Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our commercially important technology, inventions and know-how, including our Cue Reader, our Cue Cartridge, and our Cue Wand; to defend and enforce our patents; to operate without infringing, misappropriating or violating the proprietary rights of others; and to prevent others from infringing, misappropriating or violating our proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark and trade secret laws, and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. We also rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. Notwithstanding these efforts, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any patent applications we have filed or may license or file in the future, and we cannot be sure that any patents we own or license or patents that may be licensed or granted to us in the future will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or that such patents will be 
Table of Contents

commercially useful in protecting our test kits and technology. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
As of December 31, 2022, we owned twenty-three (23) issued U.S. utility patents, seven (7) pending U.S. utility patent applications, fifty-two (52) issued foreign utility patents (including patents in Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, South Korea, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and various European countries), and thirty-one (31) pending foreign utility patent applications (including pending PCT applications).
In addition, we hold design patents and patent applications that cover various ornamental features of our various current and future Cue products. As of December 31, 2022, we owned ten (10) granted U.S. design patents, seven (7) pending U.S. design patent applications, forty-eight (48) granted foreign design patents and design registrations (with protection in Australia, Canada, China, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the European Union), and eighteen (18) pending foreign design applications. Our granted U.S design patents are anticipated to naturally expire between 2029 and 2037. Our foreign patents and design registrations are anticipated to naturally expire between 2024 and 2042.
The term of individual patents depends on the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term for a utility patent is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a nonprovisional patent application in the applicable country. Our issued U.S. and foreign utility patents are anticipated to naturally expire between 2034 and 2038, and our U.S. pending utility patent applications and pending PCT applications, if issued into patents, are anticipated to naturally expire between 2034 and 2041, excluding any additional patent term adjustment(s) or extension(s), and assuming payment of all applicable maintenance or annuity fees. Once a patent expires, patent protection ends and an invention enters the public domain allowing anyone to commercially exploit the invention without infringing the patent.
We cannot guarantee that issued or pending patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection for our technology. Notwithstanding the scope of the patent protection available to us, a competitor could develop methods or devices that are not covered by our patents or circumvent these patents. Furthermore, because patent applications can take many years to publish, there may be applications unknown to us which may result in issued patents that our existing or future products or technologies may be alleged to infringe.
We also rely upon trademarks to build and maintain the integrity of our brand. As of December 31, 2022, we owned three (3) U.S. trademark registrations, four (4) U.S. trademark applications, forty-four (44) foreign trademark registrations (including registrations in China, Hong Kong, the European Union, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Korea, and Singapore), and fourteen (14) pending trademark applications (including in Canada, EU, UK, and Mexico. We also rely, in part, on unpatented trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and confidential information, to develop and maintain our competitive position and protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. However, such proprietary rights are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality and assignment agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to our proprietary information. However, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have an adequate remedy for any such breach. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have implemented measures to protect and preserve our trade secrets, such measures can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors or misused by any collaborator to whom we disclose such information. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our Cue Health Monitoring System or any of our current or expected future tests or to obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Competition
We do not believe there are currently any competitors that offer the portable, intuitive, accurate and connected platform we provide, comprised of the Cue Health Monitoring System and associated tests, our Cue Health App and our Cue Enterprise Dashboard. That said, the traditional diagnostic testing industry is highly competitive and rapidly changing. For our Cue COVID-19 Test specifically, we expect ongoing intense competition from different sources, including from manufacturers and producers of diagnostic tests, as well as vaccines and therapeutic treatments that may decrease demand for COVID-19 tests. Notably, however, we are the first molecular COVID-19 test authorized for at-home and over-the-counter use without a prescription. As we broaden our test menu, we expect ongoing intense competition from companies that develop or have 
Table of Contents

already developed molecular tests, whether for at-home and over-the-counter use or at the point-of-care, as well as companies that have or are developing antigen and antibody tests. While we believe that our differentiated technology, customer-centric design, and vertically-integrated manufacturing provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including public and private companies, academic institutions, public and private research institutions and governmental agencies.
Competitors with diagnostic testing platforms include private and public companies, such as Abbott Laboratories, Becton, Dickinson and Company, BioMerieux SA, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Danaher Corp., Ellume Limited, Everly Health, Inc., F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., Fluidigm Corporation, GenMark Diagnostics Inc., Ginkgo Bioworks, Inc., Mammoth Biosciences, Inc., LetsGetChecked, Lucira Health, Inc., Qiagen N.V., Quidel Corporation, Sherlock Biosciences, Inc., Siemens AG, Talis Biomedical Corporation, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. and Visby Medical, Inc. as well as several retailers, such as The Kroger Company, Walmart Inc. and Alberstons Companies, Inc. Large lab companies like Quest Diagnostics, Inc. and Laboratory Corporation of America have also expanded beyond centralized laboratory testing into at-home sample collection. 
As we expand our service offerings, we anticipate integrating with a variety of technology platforms. These platforms may have products or services that compete with our offerings, and include companies such as 1Life Healthcare, Inc. (d/b/a OneMedical), American Well, Inc., Hims & Hers Health, Inc., and Teladoc Health, Inc. We may also face competition from other companies, including other technology companies.
Many of the companies we currently compete with or which we may compete with in the future have significantly greater financial resources and more experience in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical and clinical development, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved tests. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, whether independently or with strategic partners. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling subjects for our clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
We believe key competitive factors impacting our success in the market include accuracy of results, ease-of-use, accessibility, time to result, clinical performance, pricing, ability to meet consumer demand, and reimbursement levels.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
Our products are manufactured within our facilities in San Diego and at other third party locations. Our products contain some components and raw materials that we purchase globally from single-source direct and indirect suppliers, some without long-term supply agreements, such as electronic components and certain chemical reagents. We do, however, periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical components in excess of current requirements, in anticipation of future manufacturing needs. See the applicable risk factor in Item 1.A. “Risk Factors” for an additional description of this risk.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,515 full-time employees. However, in January 2023 we undertook a workforce reduction plan to reduce operating expenses and adjust cash flows in light of the ongoing macroeconomic environment and its impact on our business. Our employees are primarily located in the San Diego, California area. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
Facilities
We follow Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, guidelines and are ISO 13485 certified, the key certification for medical device manufacturing, providing confidence and assurance in our final product. We are routinely audited to maintain our ISO 13485:2016 status.
During the fall of 2020, we launched a significant expansion of our manufacturing capacity, leasing an approximately 197,000 square-foot facility in Vista, California and an approximately 63,000 square-foot facility in San Diego, California. We 
Table of Contents

believe our current facilities are sufficient to meet our current needs. Our Vista facility lease expires on April 30, 2031 and our Waples facility lease expires on October 30, 2031. Both leases have options to extend.
Government Regulation
Regulation of Medical Devices in the United States
The development, testing, manufacturing, marketing, post-market surveillance, distribution, advertising and labeling of medical devices are subject to regulation in the United States by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and comparable state agencies. Unless subject to an exemption, medical devices must receive from the FDA prior to marketing either clearance of a premarket notification, known as 510(k), or premarket approval (PMA) pursuant to the FDCA. All medical devices that are regulated by the FDA are also subject to the quality system regulation. We currently operate under an EUA for an unapproved device, which will remain in effect and terminate on the earlier of a determination that the public health emergency has ceased or a change in the approval status of our product. We received an EUA from the FDA on June 10, 2020, as amended on August 20, 2020 and March 26, 2021 (designated as EUA 200248) for our Cue COVID-19 Test Kit for use at the point-of-care with specimens collected using the Cue Wand and for testing of previously collected nasal specimens in viral transport media from individuals who are suspected of having COVID-19 by their healthcare provider. We received a second EUA from the FDA on March 5, 2021 (designated as EUA Number 210180) for our Cue COVID-19 Test Kit for home and over-the-counter use without a prescription with specimens collected using the Cue Wand from adults or children greater than or equal to two years of age (swabbed by an adult) with or without symptoms or other epidemiological reasons to suspect COVID-19. Both EUAs are subject to certain Conditions of Authorization as listed in each EUA letter, including but not limited to conditions related to advertising, printed materials, and promotion.
We expect that many of our future tests will require clearance under 510(k) regulatory pathway, unless exempted or otherwise authorized pursuant to an EUA. Our current products are Class II medical devices and, but for the immediate ability to seek an EUA, would be subject to premarket notification and clearance requirements under section 510(k) of the FDCA. To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit to the FDA a 510(k) submission demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed device, known as a “predicate device.” Once the 510(k) submission is accepted for review, the FDA has 90 calendar days by regulation to review and issue a determination. As a practical matter, clearance may take and often takes longer. Upon review, the FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. 
If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, for example, due to a finding of a lack of a predicate device, that the device has a new intended use or different technological characteristics that raise different questions of safety or effectiveness when the device is compared to the cited predicate device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. If the FDA determines that the information provided in a 510(k) submission is insufficient to demonstrate substantial equivalence to the predicate device, the FDA generally identifies the specific information that needs to be provided so that the FDA may complete its evaluation of substantial equivalence, and such information may be provided within the time allotted by the FDA or in a new 510(k) submission should the original 510(k) submission have been withdrawn.
None of our tests are currently approved under PMA, nor are we currently seeking approval under a PMA for our Cue COVID-19 Test or any additional test. Class III devices require PMA approval before they can be marketed in the U.S. The PMA process is generally more demanding than the 510(k) process. A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials demonstrating that the device is safe and effective. Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of a PMA, although in practice, the FDA’s review may take and often takes significantly longer, and can take up to several years.
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include establishment registration and device listing requirements; Quality System Regulation (QSR) requirements; labeling and advertising regulations; product modification requirements; medical device reporting regulations; product correction, and recall regulations; and post-market surveillance activities.
Advertising and promotion of medical devices are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. In addition, under the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims.

Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments of 1988
The Cue Health Monitoring system and our Cue COVID-19 Test also are subject to categorization by the FDA pursuant to CLIA and its implementing regulations in the United States which establish quality standards for all laboratory testing to ensure the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results regardless of where the test is performed. When the FDA authorizes tests for use at the point-of-care under an EUA, such tests are deemed to be CLIA waived tests. As such, such tests can be performed in a patient care setting that is qualified to have the test performed there as a result of operating under a CLIA Certificate of Waiver for the duration of the emergency declaration. 
We are also required to maintain a license to conduct testing in California. California laws establish standards for day-to-day operation of our clinical laboratory, including the training and skills required of personnel and quality control. We provide testing services only to our employees, visitors, and contractors and do not provide laboratory testing services for purposes other than operation of our business.
Licensing and Regulation of Medical Device Manufacturers and Distributors
We are licensed by the California Department of Public Health as a medical device manufacturer. As a medical device manufacturer, one of the criteria is that our Quality Management System, or QMS, holds an ISO 13485:2016 certificate. 
European Medical Device Regulation
Sales of in vitro diagnostics in the European Economic Area are subject to the European regulatory framework. In order to place an in vitro diagnostic, or an accessory to an in vitro diagnostic, on the market in the European Union/European Economic Area, the device must be designed, developed, manufactured, and marketed in compliance with the relevant legal framework. Currently, in vitro diagnostics must be compliant with Directive 98/79/EEC, or the Directive; however, from May 26, 2022 Regulation (EU) 2017/746, or the Regulation, will replace the Directive. In December 2020, our COVID-19 test received the CE Mark, clearing it for sale and distribution in the European Union.
Following the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union on January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom implemented Directive 98/79/EC into U.K. law (along with other European Union legislation on medical devices) through the Medical Devices Regulations 2002. CE marking will continue to be recognized in Great Britain for medical devices until June 30, 2023, following which a UK Conformity Assessment mark will be required for a medical device or in vitro diagnostic device to be marketed in Great Britain.
Privacy Regulation
The HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the transmission, security and privacy of protected health information by covered entities subject to HIPAA, such as health plans, health care clearinghouses and healthcare providers, and their respective business associates that access protected health information. In addition, in the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. We have taken steps to comply with health information privacy requirements to which we are aware that we are subject. 
The collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the European Economic Area (EEA), including personal health data, is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679), or the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. 
U.S. Federal, State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse Laws
Anti-Kickback Statutes. The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program. “Remuneration” is broadly defined to include anything of monetary value, such as, for example, cash payments, gifts or gift certificates, discounts, or the furnishing of services, supplies or equipment. The Anti-Kickback Statute can be interpreted broadly to prohibit many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the health care industry. Many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti- Kickback Statute, and some apply to items and 
Table of Contents

services reimbursable by any payor, including private third-party payors. Further, the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018, or EKRA, prohibits payments for referrals to recovery homes, clinical treatment facilities, and laboratories. EKRA’s reach extends beyond federal health care programs to include private insurance (i.e., it is an “all payor” statute). 
State and Federal False Claims Laws. The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government. Under the False Claims Act, a person acts knowingly if he or she has actual knowledge of the information or acts in deliberate ignorance or in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information. Specific intent to defraud is not required. In addition, various states have enacted similar laws modeled after the False Claims Act that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state health care programs, and, in several states, such laws apply to claims submitted to any payor.
Physician Self-Referral Bans. The federal ban on physician self-referrals, commonly known as the Stark Law, prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, physician referrals of Medicare patients to an entity providing certain designated health services, which include laboratory services, if the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has any financial relationship with the entity. Several Stark Law exceptions are relevant to arrangements involving clinical laboratories, including but not limited to: (1) fair market value compensation for the provision of items or services; (2) payments by physicians to a laboratory for clinical laboratory services; (3) certain space and equipment rental arrangements that satisfy certain requirements; and (4) personal services arrangements. In addition to the Stark Law, many states have their own self-referral bans, which may extend to all self-referrals, regardless of the payor.
Civil Monetary Penalties Law. The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, or the CMP Law, prohibits, among other things, (1) the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state health care program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies; (2) employing or contracting with an individual or entity that the provider knows or should know is excluded from participation in a federal health care program; (3) billing for services requested by an unlicensed physician or an excluded provider; and (4) billing for medically unnecessary services. 
Transparency Laws and Regulations. The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to CMS information related to payments and other “transfers of value” to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers to report annually ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. We are subject to the Open Payments Program. Additionally, similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with healthcare professionals.
International Fraud and Abuse Laws
In Europe, various countries have adopted anti-bribery laws providing for severe consequences, in the form of criminal penalties and/or significant fines, for individuals and/or companies committing a bribery offense. We are also required to maintain accurate information on and control over sales and distributors’ activities that may fall within the purview of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or the FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring them to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
Table of Contents

Medicare is a federal program administered by CMS through Medicare Administrative Contractors, or MACs. Available to people age 65 or over, and certain other people, Medicare provides, among other things, healthcare benefits that cover, within prescribed limits, the major costs of most medically necessary care for such people, subject to certain deductibles and copayments.
CMS has established guidelines for the coverage and reimbursement of certain products and procedures by Medicare. In general, in order to be reimbursed by Medicare, a healthcare procedure furnished to a Medicare beneficiary must be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury, or to improve the functioning of a malformed body part. The methodology for determining coverage status and the amount of Medicare reimbursement varies based upon, among other factors, the setting in which a Medicare beneficiary received healthcare products and services. The reimbursement rate for certain services, including clinical laboratory services, is established under fee schedules that are developed and periodically updated pursuant to specific statutory or regulatory provisions. 
CMS also administers the Medicaid program, a cooperative federal/state program that provides medical assistance benefits to qualifying low income and medically needy people. State participation in Medicaid is optional, and each state is given discretion in developing and administering its own Medicaid program, subject to certain federal requirements pertaining to payment levels, eligibility criteria and minimum categories of services. The coverage, method and level of reimbursement vary from state to state and is subject to each state’s budget restraints. 
All CMS programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rate adjustments, administrative rulings, interpretations of policy, intermediary determinations, and government funding restrictions, all of which may materially increase or decrease the rate of program payments to healthcare facilities and other healthcare providers.
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulations
We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and permitting and licensing requirements. Such laws include those governing laboratory practices, the generation, storage, use, manufacture, handling, transportation, treatment, remediation, release and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous materials and wastes and worker health and safety. Our operations involve the generation, use, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, and the risk of injury, contamination or non-compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or permitting or licensing requirements cannot be eliminated. In particular, the introduction of our COVID-19 test requires that we maintain compliance with applicable and evolving federal and state laws and regulations relating to COVID-19, including the generation, use, storage, and disposal of testing materials and agents. agents. To date, compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our business.
