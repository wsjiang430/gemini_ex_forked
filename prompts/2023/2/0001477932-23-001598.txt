Item 1. Business

In this Annual Report, “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Black Bird Biotech, Inc., including its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Black Bird Potentials Inc., a Wyoming corporation (“BB Potentials”), Big Sky American Dist., LLC, a Montana limited liability company (“Big Sky American”), and Black Bird Hemp Manager, LLC, a Montana limited liability company.

Preliminary Statements Regarding the COVID-19 Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic had a discernable short-term negative impact on the ability of our company to obtain capital needed to accelerate the development of our business, as well as to obtain needed inventory, due to supply chain delays. While these limitations have eased, we are unable to predict when such limitations will be entirely resolved.

Overall, our company is not of a size that required us to implement “company-wide” policies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, our product manufacturing operations have experienced no negative consequences attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, inasmuch as these operations involve a limited number of persons.

For purposes of the discussion below, except where otherwise indicated, the descriptions of our business, our strategies, our risk factors and any other forward-looking statements, including regarding us, our business and the market generally, do not reflect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or our responses thereto.

Our Company After Acquiring Black Bird Potentials Inc.

With the January 2020 acquisition of Black Bird Potentials Inc. (BB Potentials), our company emerged from its long-standing status as a “shell company.” Our Board of Directors has adopted the business plan of BB Potentials and our company’s ongoing operations now include those of BB Potentials.
Developments

In March 2022, our company launched the first major initiative in marketing our MiteXstream biopesticide on a national basis, when we entered into a consulting agreement with Spire+, a Cornelius, North Carolina-based leading sales and marketing agency that specializes in brand building, marketing, communications and business development. Spire+ has begun work to implement a comprehensive go-to-market strategy for MiteXstream, including e-commerce, traditional retail and a category-specific distribution model. Spire+, an affiliate of Spire Sports + Entertainment, LLC, has a long history of building and executing successful sales and marketing programs for brands, such as Toyota, 5-hour ENERGY, Auto-Owners Insurance, ENEOS Motor Oil, Petro-Canada, STP and Parker Hannifin.
Business Overview

MiteXstream. BB Potentials is the exclusive worldwide manufacturer and distributor of MiteXstream, an EPA-registered plant-based biopesticide effective in the eradication of mites and similar pests, including spider mites, a pest that destroys crops, especially cannabis, hops, coffee, and house plants, as well as molds and mildew.

CBD and Other Products. Through BB Potentials, we manufacture and sell CBD products, including CBD Oils, gummies and pet treats, and CBD-infused personal care products, under the Grizzly Creek Naturals brand name. Big Sky American currently distributes an array of consumer products, including the Grizzly Creek Naturals products, to retail locations in Western Montana.

MiteXstream

Worldwide Exclusivity. At the present time, our future success is primarily dependent upon our ability to achieve market penetration of MiteXstream.

Pursuant to a February 2021 Manufacturing, Sales and Distribution License Agreement (the “New MiteXstream Agreement”) with Touchstone Enviro Solutions, Inc. (“Touchstone”), a company owned by three of our directors, Fabian G. Deneault, L. A. Newlan, Jr. and Eric Newlan, BB Potentials possesses the exclusive rights, even as to Touchstone, to manufacture, sell and distribute MiteXstream, an EPA-registered biopesticide (EPA Reg. No. 95366-1). The exclusivity granted would be reduced to a status of non-exclusivity, should we fail to manufacture at least 2,500 gallons of concentrate in any year during the term of the New MiteXstream Agreement; provided, however, that such minimum required is deemed to have been satisfied through December 31, 2022. We are required to pay Touchstone a royalty of $10 per gallon of MiteXstream manufactured by us or by any sublicensee of ours. For no further consideration, we were granted the rights to use the “MiteXstream” trademark and the “Harnessing the Power of Water” trademark.

The New MiteXstream Agreement replaced a prior similar agreement with Touchstone (the “Original MiteXstream Agreement”) and served to expand our company’s rights with respect to MiteXstream. The New MiteXstream Agreement contains the following important provisions as compared to the Original MiteXstream Agreement:


 | New MiteXstream Agreement | Original MiteXstream Agreement 
-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------
Term | December 31, 2080 | Initial terms of 10 years, with one 10-year renewal term 
Territory | Worldwide Exclusive (1) | United States and Canada 
Royalty | $10.00 per gallon manufactured | Effective royalty of an estimated $50 per gallon 
Minimums | 2,500 gallons of concentrate manufactured per year (2) | $20,000 of product per year 
Sublicensing | Right to sublicense granted | No right to sublicense 
Trademarks | For no extra consideration, rights granted to use “MiteXstream” and “Harnessing the Power of Water” | For no extra consideration, rights granted to use “MiteXstream”


(1) | Exclusivity ends and becomes non-exclusive, if the minimum of 2,500 gallons per year is not met.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) | The minimum (2,500 gallons per year) is deemed to have been satisfied through December 31, 2022.


The disinterested Directors of our Company approved the New MiteXstream Agreement.

Approval as Biopesticide. Effective December 16, 2020, MiteXstream was approved as a biopesticide by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA Reg. No. 95366-1). MiteXstream has been approved for sale in 44 states, with applications pending in the remaining states, except for California, the application for which is in the final stage of preparation. In addition, we intend to seek approval of MiteXstream in countries around the world, although no specific time for such actions has been set.
Sales and Distribution.

Online. We sell MiteXstream directly to customers though our website, MiteXstream.com. Our marketing efforts during the remainder of 2022 will be centered around driving customer traffic to the website for purchases MiteXstream, as well as to our Amazon page. Spire+ is focused on these efforts.
Spire+. In March 2022, our company launched the first major initiative in marketing our MiteXstream biopesticide on a national basis, when we entered into a consulting agreement with Spire+, a Cornelius, North Carolina-based leading sales and marketing agency that specializes in brand building, marketing, communications and business development. Spire+ has begun work to implement a comprehensive go-to-market strategy for MiteXstream, including e-commerce, traditional retail and a category-specific distribution model. Spire+, an affiliate of Spire Sports + Entertainment, LLC, has a long history of building and executing successful sales and marketing programs for brands, such as Toyota, 5-hour ENERGY, Auto-Owners Insurance, ENEOS Motor Oil, Petro-Canada, STP and Parker Hannifin.
Other Opportunities. In March 2021, we entered into a distribution agreement with IFC Fulfillment Company (“IFC”), a Los Angeles-based export firm, whereby IFC was appointed the exclusive distributor for MiteXstream in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. One of our Directors, Jack Jie Qin, facilitated the signing of the IFC Agreement. As of the date of this Annual Report, IFC has not made a sale of MiteXstream.

The Genesis of MiteXstream. Our President, Fabian G. Deneault, was, from 2017 through 2019, a licensed dispenser of medical marijuana (MMJ) in the State of Montana and, as such, was permitted to grow marijuana plants for use in his MMJ dispensary business. As a licensed medical marijuana grower, Mr. Deneault encountered infestations of spider mites on his plants. To combat the spider mites, Mr. Deneault developed the MiteXstream formulation (see “Product Effectiveness” below).

Mr. Deneault soon came to understand that the spider mite issue is a cannabis-industry-wide issue. In fact, all types of mites and similar pests are a significant pest in the production of a wide array of agricultural crops worldwide, including coffee, hops and strawberries, among other agricultural crops.

Product Effectiveness and Independent Testing. In original testing done by our company, we determined that, when mixed with water at the prescribed dilution rate, MiteXstream is effective in eliminating mites, including spider mites, and similar pests and their eggs, with no risk of plant damage. Additionally, MiteXstream eliminates molds and mildews on all types of plants.

BRIM Efficacy Testing. In February 2022, British Columbia, Canada-based laboratory Botanical Research in Motion (BRIM) published its Efficacy Testing Report on MiteXstream. The BRIM Report was authored by Dr. Fawzia Afreen, who, in addition to holding three international patents, publishing over 40 articles in peer-reviewed international journals and publishing two books, possesses nearly 20 years of experience in plant horticulture, plant tissue culture and plant production.

The BRIM Report, entitled “MiteXstream - a new, safe, environmentally friendly and the most effective biopesticide for controlling pests in Cannabis,” details the extensive testing procedures undertaken and ends with the following summary assessment:

“To summarize, the major findings of the study are: MiteXstream biopesticide can be a safe alternative of chemical pesticides and to achieve the maximum benefit the use of full-strength full strength concentration without any addition of surfactant is recommended. It can effectively control or eradicate the spider mites and powdery mildew as well as work as a preventative measure when applied at the appropriate dose, time, and stage. The use of MiteXstream is not limited to Cannabis it can be used to control pest infestation in a wide range of plants.”

Cannabis-Specific Independent Lab Testing. Based on independent lab testing, users of MiteXstream are able to treat their cannabis (marijuana) plants through the day of harvest and still satisfy state-level pesticide testing standards.

In January 2019, Stillwater Labs, an Olney, Montana-based medical marijuana testing facility, concluded its testing of a cannabis sample treated only with MiteXstream. In addition to testing for pesticides prohibited by the State of Montana, Stillwater Labs also tested for pesticides prohibited by the State of Oregon, the most stringent state-level marijuana testing standard. The results of this testing, presented as being measured in parts per billion (PPB), are set forth below.

Competition. The pesticide industry is characterized by severe competition, evolving industry standards, evolving business and distribution models, price cutting, with resulting downward pressure on gross margins, and price sensitivity on the part of customers. Many of our competitors possess substantially greater resources, financial and otherwise, than does our company. In addition, MiteXstream lacks name recognition. Our future success will depend on our ability to gain product name recognition and customer loyalty, as well as our being able to anticipate and respond to emerging standards and other unforeseen changes. If we fail to satisfy such standards of operation, our operating results could suffer. Further, intra-industry consolidations may result in stronger competitors and may, therefore, also harm our future results of operations. There is no assurance that we will ever overcome these challenges.
Regulation. Field testing, production and marketing of pesticide products are regulated by federal, state, local and foreign governments. The EPA regulates pesticides in the U.S. under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, as amended (“FIFRA”). Pesticides also are regulated by the states. MiteXstream is registered under FIFRA and, prior to sale in any state, will be approved by such state.

CBD and Other Products

CBD Products. We have created “Grizzly Creek Naturals” as the brand name for our CBD-related products, which are manufactured by our company using CBD purchased from third parties. Our line of Grizzly Creek Naturals CBD products are currently manufactured by BB Potentials. The Grizzly Creek Naturals product line includes CBD Oils, CBD Body Butter, CBD Lip Balm, CBD Sports Roll-on and CBD Bath Bombs. In addition, we sell CBD gummies on a private-label basis.

Other Products. Since Big Sky American started its distribution efforts, we have distributed a wide array of non-CBD consumer items to retail locations in Western Montana. These products include food items, clothing items and items associated with outdoor activities.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, we began the manufacture and sale of our Grizzly Creek Naturals hand sanitizer to distributors, directly to retail customers and directly to consumers through our website, after completed our FDA product listing in March 2020. We determined recently to cease the production of our hand sanitizer products.

Distribution.

In-House Distribution. Since it began to manufacture and sell its CBD products in mid-2019, BB Potentials has self-distributed its products. In December 2020, these distribution efforts we formalized with the formation of Big Sky American. Big Sky American currently distributes an array of consumer products, including the Grizzly Creek Naturals CBD products, to retail locations in Western Montana. In December 2020, Big Sky American entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Big Sky APA”), whereby it purchased certain distribution-related assets associated with approximately 200 retail locations in Western Montana for $200,000 in cash. These assets became available for purchase, due their owner’s determination to terminate its distribution business in such locations. The closing of under the Big Sky APA occurred in February 2021.
Online. Our Grizzly Creek Naturals products are sold to consumers through our website, GrizzlyCreekNaturals.com.

Third-Party Distributors. In 2020, we entered into a letter agreement with Las Vegas, Nevada-based Hope Botanicals LLC (the “Hope Distributor”), with respect to its selling our products primarily in the Las Vegas area and the Hope Distributor continues to purchase small amounts of products from us.

We continue to seek additional distributors who are able to demonstrate, to our management’s satisfaction, an ability to develop sales for our Grizzly Creek Naturals CBD products.

Perceived Benefits of CBD. The recent growth in sales of CBD products is primarily due to perceived benefits expressed by those who have used CBD products. While our company does not make any claims as to the effectiveness or potential benefits of CBD, the following perceived benefits expressed by those who have used CBD products include, among others:


• Relief for Chronic Pain• Reduces Seizures• Reduces Anxiety and Depression• Reduces Inflammation | • Promotes Healthy Weight• Improves Heart Health• Improves Skin Conditions 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Source: CBD Oil Benefits and Uses for Pain, Anxiety, Cancer and More,Dr. Josh Axe, DC, DMN, CNS; https://draxe.com/cbd-oil-benefits)

Competitive Strengths and Weaknesses. With respect to our Grizzly Creek Naturals products, we believe our company possesses the following competitive strengths and weaknesses:


Competitive Strengths: | • our products are produced using high-quality ingredients• we enjoy low overhead costs 
------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Competitive Weaknesses: | • none of our products enjoys brand name recognition• we possess limited capital• we have limited personnel 

Competition. The competition for customers in the CBD market is highly competitive and highly fragmented, with no significant barriers to entry. We expect competitive conditions to increase over time. There is no assurance that our Grizzly Creek Naturals CBD products will achieve profitability in the face of such competition.
Regulation. Under the 2018 Farm Bill, CBD products may be sold legally, if and only if the hemp from which the CBD is derived is produced in a manner consistent with the 2018 Farm Bill, associated federal regulations, associated state regulations and by a licensed grower. Our CBD products are in compliance with the provisions of the 2018 Farm Bill.
Industrial Hemp-Related Activities

In 2020, we formed a division of our company that was to focus on industrial hemp-related business opportunities under the “Black Bird American Hemp” brand name. During 2020 and early 2021, Black Bird American Hemp sought to develop industrial hemp processing operations in the State of Montana. However, during 2021, our management determined that market conditions, especially as it relates to attracting investors, related to the industrial hemp industry had waned, and we suspended our industrial hemp activities for the foreseeable future.

7


During 2020 and 2021, BB Potentials was a licensed hemp grower in Montana under the Montana Hemp Pilot Program. BB Potentials did not grow commercial quantities of hemp during either year. No 2022 application for a license was submitted by BB Potentials and we do not intend to submit and application during 2023.

Insurance

We have not yet purchased product liability or other insurance. However, our management intends to secure a commercially reasonable product liability insurance policy in March 2023.

Intellectual Property
