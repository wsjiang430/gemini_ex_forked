 Item 1. Business.
 Overview
 We are a clinical-stage immunology-based biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing oral small molecule therapies for patients with significant unmet needs in inflammatory diseases and oncology. Utilizing our proprietary drug discovery and development engine, we are developing highly selective small molecules designed to modulate the critical immune responses underlying these diseases. Our lead inflammation drug candidate, RPT193, and our lead oncology drug candidate, FLX475, each target C-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (“CCR4”), a drug target that potentially has broad applicability in inflammatory diseases and oncology.
 Our lead inflammation drug candidate, RPT193, is designed to selectively inhibit the migration of type 2 T helper cells (“Th2 cells”) into inflamed tissues. Th2 cells are known to be drivers of inflammatory diseases, including atopic dermatitis (“AD”), asthma, chronic spontaneous urticaria (“CSU”), alopecia areata, prurigo nodularis, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (“CRSwNP”), allergic rhinitis and eosinophilic esophagitis. We believe RPT193, if approved, could fill an unmet medical need for a safe and efficacious oral drug in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. We chose to pursue atopic dermatitis as the first indication for RPT193 because we believe the characteristics of the disease present an opportunity to rapidly demonstrate RPT193’s anti-inflammatory effect with the potential for good translatability to later-stage clinical trials. In June 2021, we announced positive topline results from our randomized placebo-controlled Phase 1b clinical trial of RPT193 as monotherapy in 31 patients with moderate-to-severe AD. After four weeks of treatment, patients who received RPT193 showed greater improvement from baseline compared to the placebo group in several standard measures of disease severity, including the Eczema Area and Severity Index (“EASI”) and the validated Investigator Global Assessment (“vIGA”). In the two-week period following the end of treatment, the RPT193 group showed continued improvement and further separation from placebo in these measures. We believe the results from this Phase 1b trial provide clinical proof-of-concept (“PoC”) in AD and potentially additional Th2-driven inflammatory diseases. We have advanced RPT193 to a Phase 2b clinical trial in patients with moderate-to-severe AD and plan to initiate a Phase 2a clinical trial in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma.
 Our lead oncology drug candidate, FLX475, is designed to selectively inhibit the migration of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (“Treg”) into tumors. We are conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial investigating FLX475 as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®) to study the safety and potential clinical activity of FLX475 in patients with advanced cancer. We have disclosed initial observations from the Phase 2 portion of the trial that demonstrated clinical activity of FLX475 as monotherapy as well as in combination with pembrolizumab, and we believe these early observations establish initial clinical PoC for FLX475. As of February 2023, we have three ongoing expanded Stage 2 cohorts in EBV+ lymphoma (monotherapy), checkpoint-naïve non-small cell lung cancer (combination) and checkpoint-experienced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
 We internally discovered and designed all our drug candidates utilizing what we refer to as our “proprietary drug discovery and development engine.” Through our team’s deep expertise in immunology and drug discovery, supported by extensive capabilities in computational sciences, we are developing the ability to exploit difficult targets and generate drug candidates that we believe, if approved, will significantly improve treatment paradigms and outcomes for patients by fundamentally modulating the immune responses in a range of inflammatory diseases and cancers. We continue to invest in our proprietary discovery and development engine and are pursuing a range of targets to generate additional potential drug candidates.
 We hold worldwide rights to each of our drug candidates, with the exception of the exclusive license granted to Hanmi Pharmaceutical Ltd. (“Hanmi”) for FLX475 in the Republic of Korea, the Republic of China (Taiwan), and the People’s Republic of China, including the special administrative regions of Macau and Hong Kong (the “Hanmi Territory”).


Our Strategy
•Advance RPT193 through clinical development to commercialization across multiple inflammatory diseases, starting with atopic dermatitis. We chose to pursue atopic dermatitis as the first indication for RPT193 because we believe the characteristics of the disease present an opportunity to rapidly demonstrate RPT193’s anti-inflammatory effect with the potential for good translatability to later-stage clinical trials. We believe we have established clinical PoC with our Phase 1b data and have advanced RPT193 to a Phase 2b clinical trial. 
 •Expand development of RPT193 into asthma and additional inflammatory diseases. As with AD, we believe that there remains significant unmet medical need and market potential for a safe and efficacious oral agent for the treatment of asthma. With our Phase 1b data, we believe RPT193 has potential clinical translatability in a variety of inflammatory diseases beyond AD and we plan to initiate a Phase 2a clinical trial of RPT193 in patients with asthma. Our goal is to develop RPT193 in multiple inflammatory diseases, including AD, asthma and potentially CSU, alopecia areata, prurigo nodularis, CRSwNP, allergic rhinitis and eosinophilic esophagitis.
 •Advance FLX475 through clinical development in charged tumor types, which represent cancer types we believe are most likely to respond to FLX475. We are evaluating FLX475’s efficacy in several tumor types both as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab, a programmed cell death 1 (“PD-1”) checkpoint inhibitor. Our goal is to expeditiously progress into registrational trials to ultimately enable treatment of cancer patients for whom current treatments are inadequate.
 •Utilize collaborations and partnerships to support our long-term goals. We plan to selectively use collaborations and partnerships as strategic tools to maximize the value of our drug candidates. 
 •Expand our pipeline by leveraging our proprietary drug discovery and development engine and oral small molecule expertise. We believe there are additional identifiable targets that will be important to fundamentally modulating the immune response in the treatment of inflammatory diseases and cancer. One such target is hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (“HPK1”) and we are working to develop a preclinical HPK1 inhibitor. We will continue to invest in our proprietary discovery and development engine and investigate identified targets to generate additional drug candidates. 
 Drug Discovery and Development Engine
We credit our rapid identification of therapeutic targets and drug candidate selection to our proprietary drug discovery and development engine, which relies on our team’s deep expertise in immunology and chemistry, supported by computational sciences and the ability to exploit difficult targets. The key pillars of our proprietary drug discovery and development engine are as follows.

1)Computationally-Driven Disease Target and Biomarker Identification. We use proprietary methods to identify targets that we believe have a high propensity to drive the immune response in disease states by computationally screening a combination of proprietary and public databases. Through this process we also identify biomarkers that can guide our clinical development strategy and increase the probability of clinical success. A computational screen we designed to seek tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte modulating genes identified CCR4 and HPK1 as potential targets. In addition to well-known and clinically validated targets such as PD-1 and CTLA-4, our target identification approach has also uncovered what we believe are key immune drivers of pathology that have not been fully explored but which may offer significant therapeutic potential. 
 2)Computationally-Enabled Design of Small Molecule Drug Properties. Key to our rapid discovery of small molecules is our use of structure and computationally assisted drug design strategies to improve potency, selectivity and pharmacokinetic properties and early testing in physiologically-relevant immune assays to rapidly identify highly selective, orally-administered small molecules. This seamless integration of biology, chemistry and computational disciplines allows for rapid cycle times and quick iterations between hypothesis and compound selection. 


3)Data-Driven Patient Selection. A key strategy for every program is to identify a patient selection and enrichment approach. Our proprietary drug discovery and development engine enables enrichment and prospective selection of patients in our early clinical trials that we believe increase the probability of clinical success. Using proprietary and public databases, we can mine contextually-rich molecular and clinical data from disease tissues to identify tumor types and inflammatory disease indications that we believe will be most likely to respond to our therapeutic agents. 
 4)Nimble Clinical Execution. We design efficient state-of-the-art clinical trials at all stages of development, incorporating patient enrichment and biomarker-based selection strategies where appropriate and identifying opportunities for potential accelerated regulatory approval. 
 Background on CCR4 in Inflammatory Diseases and Oncology
Our proprietary drug discovery and development engine has identified the cell surface receptor CCR4 as a drug target that potentially has broad applicability in inflammatory diseases and oncology. Receptors such as CCR4 bind to chemokines that orchestrate migration and homing of immune cells to specific tissues throughout the body. Chemokines specific for CCR4 are secreted from inflamed tissues and tumors, but are not highly expressed in healthy tissues. Our approach is designed to enable selective restoration of the immune response within inflamed tissues or the tumor without systemically depleting immune cells and broadly suppressing the immune system. Each of our two drug candidates, RPT193 and FLX475, target CCR4 in a manner we believe is well suited for inflammatory disease and cancer, respectively.
The immune system is a series of complex interactions between different types of white blood cells. T cells are one category of these cells that play crucial roles in immunological memory, regulation and responses. Two T cell subsets of clinical interest are Th2 cells and Treg, and both express CCR4. The two chemokines that bind to CCR4, C-C motif chemokine ligand 17 (“CCL17”) and C-C motif chemokine ligand 22 (“CCL22”), are over expressed and secreted by allergically inflamed tissues and tumors. This overexpression allows for the theoretical manipulation of CCR4 and its two T cell subtypes to address diseases across the immunological continuum spanning overactive to underactive immune responses in allergic inflammatory disease and oncology.

Our Lead Inflammation Drug Candidate—RPT193
Our lead inflammation drug candidate, RPT193, is a CCR4 antagonist designed to selectively inhibit the migration of Th2 cells into inflamed tissues. Th2 cells are known to be drivers of inflammatory diseases such as AD, asthma, CSU, alopecia areata, prurigo nodularis, CRSwNP, allergic rhinitis and eosinophilic esophagitis. The current standard of care for AD includes topical creams and steroids as well as injectable biologics, such as dupilumab. Despite recent progress in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, including AD, we believe there remains a significant unmet need for a safe, oral treatment with an attractive efficacy profile and that RPT193, if approved, could fill this unmet need.
  We hold worldwide rights to RPT193 and own granted patents with respect to RPT193 that are scheduled to expire in 2039 (not including any applicable extensions, if approved). One of those granted U.S. patents covering the composition of matter of RPT193. RPT193 is chemically distinct from FLX475, our CCR4 antagonist for oncology.
Background—Th2 Cells and Inflammatory Disease
Th2 cells express high levels of CCR4 and are clinically validated drivers of many inflammatory diseases, including AD, asthma, CSU, CRSwNP, alopecia areata, prurigo nodularis and eosinophilic esophagitis. When a pathogen comes into contact with the skin or mucosal lining of the nose or lungs, innate immune cells and antibodies that recognize the pathogen initiate a release of inflammatory cytokines. While this Th2 response may be highly effective against foreign pathogens, particularly parasites, sometimes the body overreacts to benign substances in this way, resulting in a significant influx of Th2 cells, leading to highly inflammatory conditions.

RPT193 Acts on a Well-Validated Th2 Pathway in AD and Asthma
 

At a cellular and molecular level, the Th2 response is initiated and sustained when Th2 cells are recruited to the site of inflammation by the binding of CCL17 and CCL22 to CCR4. The Th2 cells secrete inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 4 (“IL-4”), interleukin 5 (“IL-5”) and interleukin 13 (“IL-13”), which furthers the inflammation and production of CCL17 and CCL22. Patients suffering from AD and other inflammatory diseases have significantly elevated levels of both CCL17 and CCL22, and CCL17 and CCL22 levels have been found to strongly correlate with the severity of AD and many inflammatory diseases. Dupilumab works by blocking the receptor for IL-4 and IL-13, two of the cytokines produced by Th2 cells, leading to a reduction in the level of inflammation. Dupilumab also indirectly leads to reductions in the level of CCL17, thus breaking the Th2-driven inflammatory cycle. We believe that inhibition of CCR4 will block the migration of Th2 cells into these inflammatory sites, leading to reductions in inflammation thereby blocking the secretion of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 before they can induce tissue damage.
Atopic Dermatitis Overview
AD is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by skin barrier disruption and immune dysregulation. Patients with AD have chronically inflamed skin lesions that cause, among other disabilities, debilitating pruritus (itch), which can severely impair quality of life. Onset of AD often occurs during childhood and can persist into adulthood. The estimated U.S. adult prevalence of AD is approximately 19 million individuals, of which approximately 50% are diagnosed. An estimated 60% of these adults have disease characterized as moderate to severe. Furthermore, an estimated ten million children have AD, of which approximately 30% experience moderate-to-severe disease.

AD Standard of Care
Creams, ointments and topical steroids, or other topical or systemic anti-inflammatory agents, are routinely used to manage skin health and reduce skin inflammation in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. Patients with mild-to-moderate AD who do not achieve sustained alleviation of symptoms with topical treatments have historically been prescribed systemic steroids or other systemic immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporine. While these are effective as temporary treatments of flare-ups, extended use has been associated with many potential side effects or adverse events. Systemic steroids, such as prednisone, are not recommended to induce stable remission due to numerous side effects and the propensity of severe disease flares upon treatment cessation. Cyclosporine is also not suitable for long-term use as it has been associated with renal toxicity, hirsutism, nausea and lymphoma, and patients must discontinue use after one to two years.
We believe that topical immunosuppressive agents inadequately address the systemic nature of AD. Furthermore, safety issues associated with systemic immunosuppressants such as steroids and cyclosporine make them inappropriate for chronic administration. The treatment paradigm in AD is evolving given the inadequacies of current standard of care agents.

AD Emerging Standard of Care
Two recent developments within the AD treatment landscape will shape the standard of care in the future: (i) the approval of the biologic agent dupilumab for moderate-to-severe AD in 2017; and (ii) the clinical progress of the class of oral Janus kinase (“JAK”) inhibitors, some of which reached the market in 2021.
 Dupilumab is an approved biologic for AD targeting the Th2 pathway. Dupilumab prevents T cell activation and amplification of proinflammatory signaling pathways by blocking IL-4 receptor alpha, (“IL-4Ra”), preventing IL-4 and IL-13 binding. Approximately 36% of patients receiving weekly or biweekly injections of dupilumab achieved significant improvement in disease symptoms. Dupilumab was approved for moderate-to-severe AD in the United States and Europe in 2017. Worldwide net sales of dupilumab were $4.9 billion in 2021.
Two orally administered JAK inhibitors, abrocitinib and upadacitinib, have been approved for use in patients who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to take, alternative systemic medications. JAK inhibitors block the signaling pathway to multiple proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-4 and IL-13, thereby preventing the downstream signaling of Th2 cells at the sites of inflammation. While JAK inhibitors have demonstrated comparable clinical efficacy to that of dupilumab and offer the advantage of oral dosing, JAK inhibitors are broadly immunosuppressive and therefore may not be suitable for long-term dosing. Additionally, the FDA has placed black box warnings for JAK inhibitors due to the potential for serious infections, malignancies, increased mortality in certain patient groups, major adverse cardiovascular events and thromboembolic events.
Despite these recent developments, we believe that there remains significant unmet medical need and market potential for a safe and efficacious oral agent for the treatment of AD. We believe that preventing the migration of Th2 cells into inflamed tissues with an oral CCR4 antagonist represents a highly differentiated approach. We further believe that an oral agent with a favorable safety and efficacy profile would offer an attractive alternative for patients compared to the biweekly injections associated with dupilumab. While the JAK inhibitor agents are orally administered, they are broadly immunosuppressive and therefore may not be suitable for long-term dosing.
Overview of Other Inflammatory Diseases
In addition to AD, a number of inflammatory diseases are characterized by an inflammatory response to cytokines produced by Th2 cells. These diseases include asthma, CSU, alopecia areata, prurigo nodularis, CRSwNP, allergic rhinitis and eosinophilic esophagitis.
Asthma
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by intermittent airway obstruction, swelling and hyperproduction of mucus, which can result in coughing, wheezing and difficulty breathing. Allergic asthma is triggered by the inhalation of allergens including dust, pollen and dander. An estimated 25.2 million individuals in the United States have asthma, with allergic asthma as the most common subtype, constituting approximately 80% of asthmatic children and approximately 60% of asthmatic adults. Asthma is driven by both Th2 allergic and Th17 autoimmune mechanisms. An estimated 40% to 50% of patients with asthma fall within the Th2-high subtype characterized by elevated levels of IL-13 and IL-5.
Standard treatment of asthma includes inhaled beta2-agonists for the treatment of acute symptoms and in conjunction with daily low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (“ICS”) monotherapy as a first-line maintenance treatment. The anti-immunoglobin E (“Anti-IgE”) monoclonal antibody omalizumab and IL-4Ra antagonist dupilumab can be prescribed for individuals with asthma who are uncontrolled on ICS therapy. In addition, other biologics targeting the IL-5 pathway, e.g., mepolizumab, benralizumab and reslizumab, as well as tezepelumab, which targets the thymic stromal lymphopoietin (“TSLP”), are available for patients with severe asthma. While these therapies are generally effective, they are administered via injection or infusion and their targets are downstream of CCR4, presenting a market opportunity for an oral, upstream alternative.
Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria
CSU is one of a group of skin conditions that are characterized by hives, redness, itching and swelling, lasting for greater than six weeks. The trigger for CSU is unknown. Symptoms result from the degranulation of dermal mast cells and IgE signaling likely contributes to inappropriate mast cell activation. CSU affects 1% of the general population, with women affected more often than men. Though both children and adults can be diagnosed with CSU, patients typically show initial symptoms in the third to fifth decades of life.
Current treatment guidelines for CSU recommend the use of oral H1-antihistamines as a first-line therapy, with dose escalation of up to four times the standard dose in lower responders. Up to 50% of patients with CSU do not respond to H1-antihistamines and can be prescribed omalizumab, an injected monoclonal antibody, which maintains an approximately 65% response rate as a second-line treatment. Dupilumab has also demonstrated clinical effects in CSU patients in Phase 3 trials, supporting a role for allergic inflammation in CSU. Given the responses observed with approved biologic drugs, there remains an unmet need for a safe, efficacious therapy with a favorable oral dosing profile. CCL17 and CCL22 are elevated in CSU, supporting the potential use of RPT193 in this indication.
Alopecia Areata
Alopecia areata is an inflammatory disease of the hair follicle that results in nonscarring hair loss. Hair loss ranges from patchy to complete loss of scalp, eyebrow, eyelash and body hair. Alopecia areata affects approximately 1 in 1000 people worldwide with both children and adults affected.
Standard treatment for alopecia areata includes: topical or intralesional corticosteroids for limited to extensive hair loss or an oral JAK inhibitor, e.g., baricitinib, for extensive hair loss. Based a Phase 2a study of dupilumab, patients with evidence of dysregulated allergic inflammation (based on a high serum IgE level) showed preliminary evidence of improvement compared to placebo. Thus, allergic inflammation may play a role in driving disease in a subset of patients and RPT193 could provide an additional, oral, therapeutic option for these patients.
Prurigo Nodularis
 Prurigo Nodularis is a chronic skin disorder that manifests as multiple, firm, pruritic nodules. Patients are typically older with a median age of approximately 60 years and a prevalence of ~5-10 per 10,000 people in the United States.
Current management of prurigo nodularis involves the use of anti-pruritics, particularly sedating anti-histamines at bedtime, as well as emollients and occlusive dressings to soothe and/or prevent scratching. Topical and intralesional corticosteroids have been used for more limited disease, but widespread or recalcitrant disease requires systemic therapies. Phototherapy has been one option for widespread disease. In terms of medical therapy, conventional immunosuppressants, including methotrexate and cyclosporin have been used with varying success. Dupilumab was recently approved for prurigo nodularis supporting a clear role for allergic inflammation and Th2 cytokines in driving prurigo nodularis. These data also support the potential utility of RPT193 in prurigo nodularis.
Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps
CRSwNP is a disease characterized by sinonasal mucosal inflammation, which results in facial pain/pressure, nasal drainage, nasal obstruction and reduction or loss of smell, for at least 8-12 consecutive weeks. Confirmation of the disease using an objective measure such as a nasal endoscopy or CT scan is required, given lack of symptom specificity. It is believed that approximately 2-5% of the general population experiences CRSwNP. There is wide belief that CRSwNP is a heterogeneous condition and that the causes of inflammation are diverse and multifactorial, involving overlap between both host and environmental triggers.
Standard treatment of CRSwNP utilizes topical and oral steroids, antibiotics and ultimately surgical intervention if symptoms are not adequately controlled by available therapies. IgE antibodies may play a role in CRSwNP, with total IgE levels correlating with disease severity, as assessed by CT scan. As a result, anti-IgE antibody omalizumab and anti-IL-5 antibodies, including mepolizumab, have been evaluated as treatment alternatives for CRS, with mepolizumab now considered a recommended treatment for CRSwNP patients.

Dupilumab has also demonstrated activity in CRSwNP in Phase 3 trials. Compared to these widely used injectable biologics, we believe that an orally dosed therapy with comparable safety and efficacy results would have a competitive profile. Given the activity of the Th2-targeted biologics, we believe that RPT193 represents a potential oral treatment for this indication.
Allergic Rhinitis
Allergic rhinitis is a disease of the lining of the nasal passages and, in some cases, can also extend to include the lining of the sinus cavities (allergic rhinosinusitis) or involve the eyes (allergic rhinoconjunctivitis). Allergic rhinitis is common, affecting 10-30% of children and adults. Allergic rhinitis is associated with symptoms including fits of sneezing, runny nose, nasal obstruction and itch. Patients often also experience cough, irritation of the back of the throat, irritability and/or fatigue. Clinical manifestations are typically caused by exposure to allergens. Allergens causing symptoms can be either seasonal or perennial and, similarly, patients demonstrate different temporal patterns of symptoms according to individual allergen reactivity profiles. Patients with a perennial pattern may also have seasonal exacerbations. Symptoms can range from mild, intermittent to severe, with the latter leading to significant morbidity, including sleep disturbance, impaired school/work performance or poor quality-of-life.
The current treatment paradigm for severe forms of perennial allergic rhinitis includes topical, corticosteroid nasal sprays to minimize the inflammatory effects of continued allergen exposure. Anti-histamine nasal sprays and non-sedating, systemic anti-histamines are also used in conjunction with corticosteroid nasal sprays. A significant number of patients remain refractory to these treatments. Systemic therapy options for such patients are limited and include montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist. While used more commonly in the past, neuropsychiatric changes reported with montelukast led to a black box warning. We believe there is an unmet need in the tolerability and safety profiles of patients with severe refractory cases of allergic rhinitis given the dearth of systemic options available. CCL17 and CCL22 are elevated in allergic rhinitis, supporting the potential use of RPT193 in this indication.
Eosinophilic Esophagitis
Eosinophilic esophagitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the esophagus. It is estimated that eosinophilic esophagitis affects at least 150,000 people in the United States. Studies from Western Europe, Australia and North America estimate prevalence to be 50-100 cases per 100,000 persons. Eosinophilic esophagitis is caused by the presence of a large number of eosinophils in the esophagus, which stems from many factors such as immune hypersensitivity, environmental proteins and genetics.
Standard treatment for eosinophilic esophagitis includes diet modification, esophageal dilation and drugs, with topical corticosteroids as a first-line medication. It is estimated that there is at least a partial symptomatic response seen in 60-75% of adults with eosinophilic esophagitis who take topical steroids. While steroids offer symptomatic relief once treated, patients are required to continue maintenance regimens as disease recurrence is common after discontinuation of treatment. Dupilumab has demonstrated activity in eosinophilic esophagitis in clinical trials, supporting the potential use of RPT193 in this indication.
Our Inflammatory Disease Solution: RPT193
While there are marketed injectable biologics and oral JAK inhibitors, as well as oral drug candidates and injectable biologics in clinical development, we believe there is an unmet need in the treatment landscape for a safe and efficacious oral therapy for the long-term treatment of AD. We believe RPT193, our oral, small molecule CCR4 antagonist designed to block the migration of inflammatory Th2 cells into inflamed tissues, can, if approved, fill this unmet need.
 RPT193 has demonstrated the ability to block the migration of mouse and human Th2 cells in vitro and in vivo and has demonstrated activity in multiple preclinical mouse models of AD and asthma. The observed activity in preclinical mouse models was similar to that of commercially available anti-mouse IL-13 and anti-IL-4 receptor antibodies, which we believe are representative of the class of biologics such as lebrikizumab, dupilumab and others targeting Th2-derived cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13. We believe that the results observed in these models demonstrate the clinical potential to treat a number of Th2-driven inflammatory diseases.
RPT193 for Atopic Dermatitis
 Preclinical Data: RPT193 Reduces Skin Inflammation in a Therapeutic Th2-Driven AD Model
 In a mouse model of AD, repeated systemic sensitization to fluorescein isothiocyanate (“FITC”), which induces a strong Th2 cell-mediated response leading to increased expression of Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. This leads to inflammation resulting in swelling that is measured as ear thickness. In this therapeutic model, mice receive treatment 24 hours following the allergen challenge when significant ear inflammation was already observed. Oral administration of RPT193 resulted in a statistically significant reduction in ear thickness compared to treatment control (p < 0.05). When comparing to the respective vehicle or isotype control, RPT193, anti-IL-13 antibody and an anti-IL-4R antibody had similar effects. Therefore, the treatment effect of once daily dosing of RPT193 was comparable to that observed with the systemic administration anti-IL-13 and anti-IL-4R antibodies.
RPT193 Reduces Skin Inflammation in a Therapeutic Th2-Driven AD Model


   

RPT193-01: Phase 1a/1b Clinical Trial in Healthy Subjects and Subjects with Atopic Dermatitis
We initiated a first-in-human Phase 1a/1b trial in August 2019. The blinded Phase 1a portion of the trial, which was conducted in healthy volunteers, focused on safety. Following successful completion of the Phase 1a portion, we progressed to Phase 1b and in June 2021, reported positive topline results from this randomized, placebo-controlled trial in patients with moderate-to-severe AD.
The blinded Phase 1a portion of the Phase 1a/1b trial was a standard single and multiple dose escalation (“SAD/MAD”) study. The data from the Phase 1a study demonstrated pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics that support once-daily oral dosing with RPT193, and blinded review of safety data supported initiation of the Phase 1b portion of the trial.
Phase 1a Data Supports Once-Daily Dose
 

The Phase 1b portion of the Phase 1a/1b trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study examining RPT193 as monotherapy in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. The study enrolled 31 patients who had an inadequate response to, or were intolerant of, topical corticosteroids. Of the 31 patients enrolled, 21 were treated with 400 mg of RPT193, administered orally once-daily for four weeks, while 10 patients received placebo. The Phase 1b trial was not powered to achieve statistical significance for any particular endpoint.
At the end of the four-week treatment period, the RPT193 group showed clear improvement in key exploratory efficacy measures compared to placebo, including EASI, vIGA and pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (“NRS”).
 •Patients treated with RPT193 achieved a 36.3% improvement in EASI score from baseline, compared with a 17.0% improvement in patients in the placebo group.
 •42.9% of patients treated with RPT193 achieved a 50% improvement in EASI score (“EASI-50”), compared with 10.0% in the placebo group. 
 •4.8% of patients treated with RPT193 achieved a vIGA score of 0/1 and at least a two-point improvement over baseline, compared with 0.0% in the placebo group. 
 •45.0% of patients treated with RPT193 achieved at least a four-point reduction in the pruritus NRS score, compared with 22.2% in the placebo group.
 Patients were also evaluated for exploratory endpoints at six weeks, i.e., two weeks after the end of treatment. At the six-week timepoint, patients treated with RPT193 showed further improvement in EASI score and vIGA:
 •Patients treated with RPT193 achieved a 53.2% improvement in EASI score from baseline, compared with a 9.6% improvement in patients in the placebo group. 
 •61.9% of patients treated with RPT193 achieved EASI-50, compared with 20.0% in the placebo group. 
 •14.3% of patients treated with RPT193 achieved a vIGA score of 0/1 and at least a two-point improvement over baseline, compared with 0.0% in the placebo group. 


Based on exploratory statistical analyses, the difference between RPT193 and placebo on the percent change in EASI score was statistically significant at the six-week timepoint (p < 0.05). No other endpoints or timepoints achieved statistical significance.
 
Other measures of clinical effect commonly used in clinical trials for AD include EASI-50, EASI-75 (a 75% improvement in EASI score) and EASI-90 (a 90% improvement in EASI score) as well as vIGA 0/1 (achieving clear or almost clear skin on the vIGA). Data from the Phase 1b trial show that, at the six-week timepoint, the proportion of the RPT193 group who achieved EASI-50, EASI-75, EASI-90 and vIGA 0/1 were all greater than the proportion of the placebo group.
 


RPT193 was well tolerated in the Phase 1b study. No serious adverse events were reported, and all adverse events reported were mild or moderate in intensity. The overall safety profile of RPT193 from the Phase 1a study in healthy volunteers and from the Phase 1b study in patients with moderate-to-severe AD suggest RPT193 is a well-tolerated oral drug that would not require any laboratory safety monitoring.
 RPT193-02: Phase 2b Clinical Trial in Atopic Dermatitis
 In May 2022, we initiated a 16-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of RPT193 as monotherapy in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. The Phase 2b study will compare three oral dose levels of RPT193 (50, 200 and 400 mg once daily) to placebo with a treatment duration of 16 weeks and will enroll approximately 67 patients in each of the four cohorts (three active and one placebo). The co-primary endpoints for the trial are the percent change in EASI from baseline at week 16 and incidence of treatment emergent adverse events. Key secondary endpoints include the percentage of patients achieving a vIGA score of 0 or 1 at week 16, the percentage of patients achieving EASI-75 at week 16, and the percent change from baseline in the Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS) from an itch daily e-diary at week 16. Furthermore, given maximum clinical benefit in the four-week Phase 1b trial was observed two weeks after cessation of treatment, patients in the Phase 2b trial will be followed for an additional eight weeks beyond the 16-week treatment period to understand whether sustained responses and/or further improvement in clinical parameters are observed beyond the treatment period.




RPT193 for Asthma
 Preclinical Data: RPT193 Efficacy in a Preclinical Model of Allergic Asthma
In a model of allergic asthma induced by the allergen ovalbumin (“OVA”), mice treated with RPT193 showed significantly reduced immune cell migration into the lungs and reduced Th2-derived cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13, which are drivers of the disease. Analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (“BALF”) taken from the lungs of the mice showed dose-dependent decreases in both IL-5 and IL-13. Not unexpectedly, anti-IL-13 had no effect on levels of IL-5 in the BALF. The reduction of the cellular infiltrate and the level of Th2-derived cytokines in the BALF supports the hypothesis that RPT193 was effective in reducing migration of Th2 cells into the lungs as evidenced by lowered overall allergic inflammation.
We believe the overall activity of RPT193 in this OVA-induced asthma model suggests that RPT193, if approved, could fill an unmet medical need for the treatment of allergic disorders and as an orally available therapy, could represent a significant advantage over biologics, which require regular injections.
RPT193-03: Phase 2a Clinical Trial in Asthma
 We believe the results from our Phase 1b clinical trial of RPT193 in patients with AD provide clinical PoC in AD and potentially additional Th2-driven inflammatory diseases. Similar to patients with AD, patients with asthma are known to have elevated levels of CCL17 in the blood and sputum, and the approvals of dupilumab in both AD and asthma suggest common pathology. With our Phase 1b data in AD and preclinical data in allergic asthma, we believe RPT193 has the potential to fill an unmet need for a safe and efficacious oral therapy for patients with moderate-to-severe asthma. We plan to initiate a 14-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2a clinical trial of RPT193 in patients with asthma.
Our Lead Oncology Drug Candidate—FLX475
Our lead oncology drug candidate, FLX475, is designed to selectively inhibit the migration of immunosuppressive Treg into tumors, while sparing Treg in healthy tissues and without negatively impacting effector immune cells. Treg represent a dominant pathway for downregulating the immune response. We will initially develop FLX475 in charged tumors, in which we believe there remains significant unmet need.
We own an issued U.S. composition of matter patent directed to FLX475 that is scheduled to expire in 2037 (not including any applicable extensions, if approved). We have entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Hanmi, whereby we granted Hanmi the exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize FLX475 in the Hanmi Territory.
FLX475: Highly Selective Approach for Targeting Tumor Treg
 

CCR4 in Charged Tumors
Our proprietary drug discovery and development engine has identified certain tumors where we believe FLX475 has the greatest probability of demonstrating clinical benefit. We refer to these tumors as “charged” as defined by (i) their expression of high levels of CCR4 ligands, (ii) their enrichment for Treg and (iii) their enrichment for CD8 effector T cells. Tumors with high levels of these three parameters imply they have the necessary components to generate a potent immune response; however, the presence of Treg dampens this response. Additionally, we have discovered that the presence of oncogenic viruses, such as Epstein Barr virus (“EBV”) and the human papilloma virus (“HPV”), is associated with tumors that are highly charged and can be prospectively selected. As shown in the diagram below, we have identified numerous tumors as being charged, including non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”), triple-negative breast cancer (“TNBC”), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (“HNSCC”), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (“NPC”), gastric cancer, EBV+ Hodgkin lymphoma (“HL”) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”) and cervical cancer. The data presented in the diagram below was derived from an in-house analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas Database and additional published sources and confirmed by us through in situ hybridization of over 400 tumor microarray samples.
Identification and Characterization of Charged Tumors



The graph above reflects a logarithmic scale on each axis.


Oncology Market Overview
Significant progress in cancer treatment has been made recently with the development of highly targeted and immuno-oncology-based therapies. Remarkable clinical response rates have been observed with targeted therapies in selective patient populations, while in a subset of a broad range of tumors, immuno-oncology products have demonstrated durable responses and possible cures. Although true breakthroughs have been achieved, often only a very narrow segment of the patient population can be treated or are responsive to these novel therapies. Hence, there remains a significant unmet medical need for a majority of tumor types including charged tumors in which we intend to develop FLX475 either as single agent or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab or other agents.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer, representing 82% of all lung cancer cases in the United States. Squamous cell carcinoma (“NSCLC Sq.”), adenocarcinoma (“NSCLC Ad.”) and large cell carcinoma are all subtypes of NSCLC. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for both men and women. In 2020, an estimated 130,180 people in the United States died from lung cancer. There are approximately 237,000 diagnoses of lung cancer annually in the United States. Despite the availability of numerous available therapies, the prognosis remains poor, with an overall five-year survival rate for all patients diagnosed with NSCLC as low as 26%.
 Standard therapies include surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Up to a third of NSCLC patients have tumors with mutations in genes, e.g., epidermal growth factor receptor and anaplastic lymphoma kinase, for which molecularly-targeted therapies have been approved, e.g., erlotinib, gefitinib or crizotinib. However, these treatments usually do not result in long-term remissions, and the tumors generally return and become resistant to therapy.
Immunotherapies that target PD-1 or the PD-1 ligand (“PD-L1”), e.g., pembrolizumab, nivolumab and atezolizumab, have recently been approved for the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC either alone (for previously untreated or treated patients) or in combination with chemotherapy (for previously untreated patients). Treatment with these immunotherapy agents in NSCLC has resulted in promising activity ranging from approximately 15-30% overall response rates in previously treated patients to approximately 40-60% response rates in combination with chemotherapy in previously untreated patients. However, approximately 50-80% of patients do not respond to these therapies, indicating significant unmet medical need remains.
 Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
HNSCC represent a broad category of cancers that arise from different tissues that have been grouped anatomically in the head and neck region. HNSCC accounts for about 4% of all cancers in the United States with an estimated 53,000 new cases and 10,860 deaths in 2019. The five-year survival rate for people with head and neck cancer varies and depends on several factors making an overall five-year survival rate difficult to track accurately. Most cases of HNSCC are considered to be related to use of tobacco or alcohol or to exposure to HPV.
Treatment for HNSCC can include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy or a combination of treatments. These tumors are believed to express a fair number of tumor-specific antigens, making them attractive targets for immunotherapies. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab have been approved for recurrent and metastatic HNSCC based on their ability to shrink tumors and increase median survival. However, treatment with either agent led to partial or complete tumor shrinkage in approximately 15% of treated HNSCC patients, indicating that over 80% of patients do not respond to therapy and that a significant unmet clinical need remains.
Hodgkin Lymphoma
HL, formerly called Hodgkin’s disease, is a cancer of the lymphatic system that arises in immune cells called B cells. HL accounts for approximately 10% of all lymphomas and approximately 0.6% of all cancers diagnosed in the developed world annually. Approximately 8,100 people in the United States are estimated to be diagnosed with HL in 2019, with an estimated 1,000 deaths. EBV has been associated with approximately 30- 50% of HL.

While approximately 75% of patients can be cured with standard therapies including combination chemotherapy, radiation therapy, high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation, novel therapies are being developed to further improve clinical outcomes. The CD30-directed antibody-drug conjugate brentuximab vedotin (marketed as Adcetris) has been approved for certain adult patients with classical HL (“cHL”). Nivolumab and pembrolizumab are immunotherapies that have been granted accelerated approval for the treatment of patients with cHL that has recurred or progressed after multiple previous treatments, including autologous transplantation and post-transplant treatment with brentuximab vedotin. For both pembrolizumab and nivolumab, the overall response rate in these relapsed and refractory cHL was approximately 69%. However, the average duration of response to these anti-PD-1 therapies is less than a year, signifying the need for continued advances.
Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
NHL, another cancer of the lymphatic system, is not a single disease but rather a group of cancers affecting cells of the immune system. Although the various types of NHL have common elements, they differ in other areas, including their appearance under the microscope, their molecular features, their growth patterns, their impact on the body and treatment. According to the National Cancer Institute, in the United States approximately 74,200 patients were diagnosed with NHL in 2018 and 19,910 patients died as a result of NHL in 2018. The five-year survival rate is 71.4%. While there is no direct cause of NHL, it is generally linked to a weakened immune system and begins when the body produces too many abnormal lymphocytes.
There is a wide range of therapies available for the treatment of NHL depending on the subtype of the disease, its aggressiveness and the patient’s overall health. These include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy such as monoclonal antibodies, checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor T cells (“CAR-T cells”), targeted therapies and stem cell transplantation. Depending upon the analysis and subtype, EBV has been associated anywhere from less than 10% to greater than 90%, or approximately 12% of NHL, on average.
Our Oncology Solution: FLX475
FLX475 is an oral small molecule that is designed to selectively inhibit the migration of immunosuppressive Treg into tumors while sparing Treg in healthy tissues and without negatively impacting effector immune cells. Treg represent a dominant pathway for downregulating the immune response. Many current approaches to deplete Treg in the tumor have resulted in systemic Treg depletion, and such approaches been associated with serious safety issues (such as autoimmunity). In addition, these approaches have been associated with the depletion of effector immune cells, which has the potential to limit their efficacy.
We will initially develop FLX475 in charged tumors, in which we believe there remains significant unmet medical need.
FLX475 Preclinical Data
 In preclinical studies, our drug candidate appears to selectively restore the immune response within the tumor microenvironment (“TME”) without systemically depleting T cells. We believe FLX475 has attractive characteristics for use as a single agent and in combination regimens with a variety of both conventional and immune-based therapies given its favorable safety profile observed in preclinical studies and early-stage clinical studies, as well as the synergistic nature of its mechanism of action as demonstrated in preclinical mouse models.
We evaluated the mechanism of action as well as the antitumor activity of FLX475 (or a preclinical tool CCR4 antagonist) in two kinds of preclinical mouse tumor models representing the human equivalent of (i) a “charged” tumor and (ii) tumors that accumulated Treg in the TME following checkpoint inhibitor treatment.
CCR4 Antagonist Single Agent Antitumor Activity in a Mouse Model of a Charged Tumor
The antitumor activity of a CCR4 antagonist closely related to FLX475 was assessed in the Pan02 mouse tumor model. Oral administration of the CCR4 antagonist demonstrated single agent reduction in tumor growth, which was statistically significantly different from mice who received vehicle control (p < 0.05) and observed antitumor activity was similar to an immune checkpoint inhibitor. Importantly, the combination of our CCR4 antagonist with the checkpoint inhibitor resulted in enhanced antitumor activity. Analysis of the TME in mice treated with our CCR4 antagonist showed a statistically significant increase in the CD8 : Treg ratio compared to vehicle control and similar activity compared to the checkpoint inhibitor. As with the antitumor activity, the combination of our CCR4 antagonist with the immune checkpoint inhibitor further increased the CD8 : Treg ratio. The increase of the CD8 : Treg ratio demonstrates a shift from an immune-suppressive to an immune-stimulatory environment. This ratio is a well-established biomarker in human clinical trials and has been demonstrated to correlate with clinical outcome.
CCR4 Antagonist: Single Agent Activity in a Mouse Model of a Charged Tumor





Antitumor Activity of the Combination of a CCR4 Antagonist and Checkpoint Inhibitor in a Mouse Tumor Model
The antitumor activity of a CCR4 antagonist closely related to FLX475 in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor was evaluated in the CT26 mouse tumor model. Single-agent activity of a checkpoint inhibitor resulted in modest antitumor activity and almost no cures. However, the combination of a CCR4 antagonist and a checkpoint inhibitor resulted in statistically significant (p < 0.05) synergistic antitumor activity with 50% of all mice showing complete tumor regression in the experiment shown. In multiple experiments, an average of 39% experienced tumor regression. Mice treated with the combination approach were completely resistant to rechallenge with the same tumor, confirming that the antitumor effect observed during the treatment phase was immune-mediated and associated with long-term immune memory. In our mouse studies, the combination of a CCR4 antagonist with a checkpoint inhibitor demonstrated an increase in the ratio of effector T cells to Treg. Previous studies have shown that this ratio is an indicator of prognosis in many cancers, including ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, glioblastoma, NHL and melanoma. We believe that the ability of a CCR4 antagonist to increase this ratio and provide therapeutic benefit will not be limited to a few select cancers, but may have broad implications across many tumor types. The ability of a CCR4 antagonist to prevent Treg migration suggests that combining FLX475 with a checkpoint inhibitor may provide highly effective antitumor activity by potentially deepening or broadening responses compared to checkpoint inhibitor alone.

FLX475: Clinical Trials
FLX475-01: A Phase 1 Clinical Trial of FLX475 in Healthy Volunteers
We completed a placebo-controlled, double-blind dose-escalation Phase 1 clinical trial of FLX475 in 104 healthy volunteers. We designed and conducted the healthy volunteer study in order to (i) rapidly generate PK and receptor occupancy data that allow us to identify a therapeutic dose, (ii) corroborate in humans our observed favorable preclinical safety profile and (iii) allow us to accelerate the dose-escalation portion of our Phase 1/2 study and drive efficiencies in our clinical development going forward. In this Phase 1 study, FLX475 was well tolerated and demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of CCR4 with no observed immune-related adverse events or significant clinical adverse events.
Oral dosing of FLX475 led to linear PK and a clear dose-related inhibition of CCR4 with low subject-to-subject variability. Based on analysis of the multiple dose data, at the 75 mg once-daily dose, 75% receptor occupancy was achieved in six out of six healthy volunteers, which, in our preclinical studies, corresponded with 90% inhibition of in vitro Treg migration and the highest level of inhibition of in vivo Treg migration and antitumor activity.
FLX475: Favorable Exposure in Healthy Volunteer Study




CCR4 Target Coverage Exceeded at 75 mg Once Daily Dosing with FLX475



FLX475 was well tolerated, with no significant lab abnormalities, serious adverse events or dose-limiting clinical adverse events. There was no evidence of autoimmunity or changes in peripheral blood immune cell populations. Sporadic Grade 1 corrected Q-T interval (“QTc”) prolongation was observed in nearly every cohort, including placebo. No QTc prolongation greater than Grade 1 was observed in 14-day multiple ascending dose cohort doses through 300/100 mg (300 mg Day 1 loading dose followed by 100 mg once daily), including the projected efficacious dose of 75 mg once daily. At the highest dose (300/150 mg) correlating with exposures three to five times that needed to achieve efficacious exposure, two subjects (out of six dosed with FLX475) met QTc stopping criteria (greater than 60 msec prolongation from baseline, one of whom also exhibited a transient Grade 2 QTc prolongation), which were asymptomatic and not associated with arrhythmia or any other adverse event.
FLX475-02: A Phase 1/2 Dose Escalation and Expansion Study of FLX475 Alone and in Combination with Pembrolizumab in Advanced Cancer
We are conducting a Phase 1/2 trial of FLX475 as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab and are currently in the Phase 2 portion of the study.
The Phase 1 portion of the study was a standard dose escalation study intended primarily to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in patients with multiple tumor types including some that may be charged.
We reported results from the Phase 1 portion in November 2020. A total of 37 patients with cancers of different types were enrolled. Nineteen patients were treated with one of four doses (25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg or 100 mg once daily) of FLX475 monotherapy and 18 were treated with one of three doses (50 mg, 75 mg or 100 mg once daily) of FLX475 in combination with the standard dose of pembrolizumab. The Phase 1 results showed FLX475 had a favorable safety profile, with no maximum tolerated dose reached. Two dose-limiting toxicities (“DLTs”) of asymptomatic QTc prolongation were observed in the monotherapy cohorts, one in the 75 mg cohort and one in the 100 mg cohort. No DLTs were observed in the Phase 1 combination cohorts. Based on the Phase 1 data, 100 mg was selected as the recommended Phase 2 dose for both the monotherapy and combination therapy cohorts.
 Drug exposures were roughly dose-proportional and consistent with the previous Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers. The majority of patients on the 75 mg daily dose reached the targeted exposure level. Receptor occupancy of CCR4 on Treg was also proportional to FLX475 exposure levels and consistent with that previously observed in healthy volunteers.
FLX475 Phase 1 Pharmacokinetic Data
 
FLX475 Phase 1 Receptor Occupancy Data
 
In the Phase 1 portion of the trial, of 17 evaluable monotherapy patients, there was one unconfirmed partial response in a patient with relapsed metastatic cervical cancer. Of 14 evaluable patients in the combination cohorts, there were two confirmed partial responses: a patient with NSCLC who had progressed on prior checkpoint treatment (atezolizumab) and who at the time of disclosure was on study for 18 months of treatment, and a patient with checkpoint inhibitor-naïve urothelial cancer who at the time of disclosure was on study for over nine months of treatment.
The Phase 2 portion of the Phase 1/2 trial is designed to evaluate FLX475 as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab specifically in patients with several types of charged tumors, which represent cancer types we believe are most likely to respond to FLX475. The Phase 2 portion is a gated two-stage design. In Stage 1, cohorts of at least ten patients each were dosed with FLX475 as monotherapy (100 mg once daily) or in combination with pembrolizumab (100 mg once daily and a standard regimen of pembrolizumab). Cohorts in which promising activity is observed would then proceed to Stage 2 to enroll an additional 19 patients. The Phase 2 portion of the trial originally started with eight cohorts in total: four monotherapy cohorts with patients with either NPC, lymphoma confirmed to be EBV+, cervical cancer that is HPV+ or HNSCC that is naïve to checkpoint therapy, and four combination cohorts with NSCLC or HNSCC patients who have been previously treated with checkpoint inhibitors or patients with TNBC or HNSCC that is naïve to checkpoint inhibitors. We subsequently added a Stage 1 combination cohort in patients with NSCLC that is naïve to checkpoint therapy.
FLX475 Phase 2 Trial
 


In November 2020, we reported initial observations from four of the eight cohorts in the Phase 2 portion of the trial: EBV+ lymphoma (monotherapy), NPC (monotherapy) and CPI-naïve HNSCC (monotherapy and combination). Based on the early results from these four cohorts, which we believe provide initial clinical PoC, we selected three indications to expand to Stage 2, EBV+ lymphoma (monotherapy), NPC (combination) and CPI-naïve HNSCC (combination).
 In September 2021, we announced that we were expanding the CPI-experienced HNSSC cohort to Stage 2 and that we were not expanding the TNBC and CPI-experienced NSCLC cohorts to Stage 2. In November 2022, we announced that we were expanding the CPI-naïve NSCLC combination cohort to Stage 2 and that we were not moving forward with development in NPC and CPI-naïve HNSCC. As of February 2023, we have three ongoing expanded Stage 2 cohorts: EBV+ lymphoma (monotherapy), CPI-naïve NSCLC (combination) and CPI-experienced HNSCC (combination).
 

EBV+ Lymphoma
 In November 2020, we reported that early data from the first two patients with EBV+ lymphoma treated with FLX475 monotherapy show significant target tumor reduction, including one patient who achieved a durable complete metabolic response and was on study for more than nine months as of November 2020. We decided to expand the EBV+ lymphoma monotherapy cohort to Stage 2.
Below are images of the screening and on-study positron emission tomography (“PET”) scans from the patient who achieved a complete metabolic response. The patient is a 53-year-old with EBV+ NK/T cell lymphoma, previously treated with chemotherapy followed by progression of disease. Primary lesions noted behind the left ear and in the right thigh (bright signals in brain, kidneys and bladder are normal background) showed significant decrease in signal by 8 weeks of treatment with FLX475, consistent with complete metabolic response, which continued to improve by scan shown at 33 weeks on study. Photographs of the subcutaneous lesion behind the left ear also show significant clinical improvement and visible resolution over the course of treatment.
 FLX475 Phase 2 EBV+ Lymphoma Patient PET Scans
 
FLX475 Phase 2 EBV+ Lymphoma Patient: Change in Subcutaneous Lesion
 


In December 2022, we reported updated data from the six patients with EBV+ NK/T cell lymphoma treated with FLX475 monotherapy in the EBV+ lymphoma cohort. Of these six patients, there were four responses, with two durable complete metabolic responses (CMR), one unconfirmed CMR and one unconfirmed partial metabolic response.
Checkpoint Inhibitor-Naive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
 In December 2022, we reported data from Stage 1 of a Phase 2 combination cohort in patients with CPI-naïve NSCLC. A total of 13 patients were enrolled and the data showed a confirmed overall response rate of 31% (4/13 patients), including two responses that were ongoing for over one year as of the time of disclosure. Of the 13 patients, eight patients had PD-L1 positive tumors (TPS ≥1%), including two with PD-L1 high tumors (TPS ≥50%), four patients had PD-L1 negative tumors (TPS <1%) and one patient’s PD-L1 status was unknown. The confirmed response rate in the PD-L1 positive tumors was 38% (3/8 patients) and in the PD-L1 negative tumors was 25% (1/4 patients). None of the four responders were PD-L1 high. Most of the patients enrolled in this NSCLC cohort had been previously treated with 1-3 or more prior therapies for advanced disease (10/13 patients). Based on these data, we have advanced this cohort to Stage 2 and are enrolling additional patients.


As of December 2022, we have reported cumulative safety data on all Phase 1 patients and the Phase 2 NK/T cell lymphoma and CPI-naïve NSCLC patients reported above, which include a total of 25 patients treated with FLX475 monotherapy and 39 patients treated with FLX475 in combination with pembrolizumab. FLX475 demonstrated a favorable safety profile with once-daily oral dosing both as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab, with no new significant safety findings compared to those previously reported in healthy volunteers and in patients from the Phase 1 portion of the trial. For more information regarding the risks associated with our Phase 1/2 clinical trial for FLX475, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—RPT193 and FLX475 are in clinical development, which may fail or suffer delays that materially and adversely affect their commercial viability.”
 In addition, biomarker data obtained from the patients in the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial may inform the generation of a companion diagnostic that could potentially be used to prospectively select for patients who may be more likely to respond to FLX475 therapy in a future study, thus increasing the chances of a positive trial result and regulatory approval. Our comprehensive biomarker plan includes analysis of the TME in paired biopsies collected before and on treatment. Key biomarkers include (i) CD8 : Treg ratio as detected by immunohistochemistry, (ii) peripheral blood analysis for CCL17 and CCL22 and (iii) exploratory analysis, including immune phenotyping, transcriptomics and T cell clonality. Preliminary data from our measure of CD8 and Treg by IHC indicate an increase in the CD8:Treg ratio in nine of the 11 patients with paired tumor biopsies from both the Phase 1 and Phase 2 portions of the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial. This suggests activity consistent with our intended mechanism of action and potentially beneficial changes in the TME. For more information regarding the risks associated with our Phase 1/2 clinical trial for FLX475, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business.”

Our HPK1 Program
Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (“HPK1”) is a negative regulator of T cell activation, and the inhibition of HPK1 has the potential to enhance T cell function and the endogenous antitumor response alone or in combination with other immuno-oncology (“IO”) therapies. We identified HPK1 as a potential target in a computational screen that identified a number of targets, including PD-1 and CCR4. We have demonstrated that inhibition of HPK1 enhanced activation of primary mouse and human T cells in vitro, as well as antigen-specific CD8 T cell effector function in vivo. Oral administration of an HPK1 inhibitor resulted in single agent antitumor activity and complete tumor regression in multiple mice when dosed in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor. We are refining the chemical structure of various HPK1 compounds utilizing high resolution crystal structures with the goal of selecting a preclinical development candidate.
 HPK1 Inhibition has the Potential to Enhance Various IO Therapies
 
Preclinical Data
 Inhibiting HPK1 In Vitro Enhances Antigen-Specific Stimulation of Mouse CD8 T cells
 Stimulation of antigen-specific T cells depends on the strength of the interaction of the T cell receptor with its cognate peptide: MHC complex, costimulatory signals as well as other factors. It has been shown that HPK1 is a negative regulator of T cell stimulation and that activation of HPK1 following T cell receptor (“TCR”) signaling limits the extent of T cell activation, cytokine secretion and proliferation. In our in vitro studies of antigen-stimulated mouse T cells, pharmacologic inhibition of HPK1 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in cytokine-secreting CD8 T cells.
HPK1 Inhibition Enhances Mouse CD8+ T Cell Activation In Vitro
 

Pharmacologic Inhibition HPK1 Enhances the Induction of Antigen-Specific CD4 and CD8 T Cells In Vivo
 In our in vivo studies, pharmacologic inhibition of HPK1 resulted in the enhanced induction of antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells. Mice were vaccinated either in the presence or absence of pharmacologic inhibition of HPK1 and antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell immunity was determined days later. HPK1 inhibition resulted in a two to three-fold increase in antigen specific T cell immunity.
Pharmacologic Inhibition of HPK1 Enhances the Induction of Antigen-Specific CD4+ and CD8+ T Cells In Vivo
 
Pharmacologic Inhibition HPK1 Enhances Anti-CTLA Antitumor Activity
 In a mouse model for colorectal cancer (“CT26”) pharmacologic inhibition of HPK1 alone resulted in modest tumor growth delay and enhanced survival. In combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, HPK1 inhibition resulted in complete tumor regression in a subset of mice and significant prolonged survival. Our work confirms the importance of HPK1 for T cell function and supports HPK1 as a promising immuno-oncology target.

We may not be able to obtain patent protections for our compositions, methods of use, dosing and formulations, manufacturing and drug development processes and technologies throughout the world. Issued patents can provide protection for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In general, patents issued for applications filed in the United States expire 20 years after the earliest effective filing date. In addition, in certain instances, the term of an issued U.S. patent that covers or claims an FDA approved product can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, which is called patent term extension. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. For more information regarding patent term extensions, please see “Business—U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity” below. The term of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with the laws of the foreign jurisdiction, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. The patent term may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our products for an adequate amount of time. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”

The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of biopharmaceuticals has emerged in the United States. The relevant patent laws and their interpretation outside of the United States is also uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our technology or drug candidates and could affect the value of such intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining, maintaining, enforcing and defending patent claims that cover our technology, inventions and improvements. We cannot guarantee that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may file in the future, nor can we ensure that any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products, the methods of use or manufacture of those products. Moreover, any issued patents we obtain do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products. Patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology space are evolving and involve many risks and uncertainties. For example, third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our drug candidates and practicing our proprietary technology, and our patent rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or could limit the term of patent protection that otherwise may exist for our drug candidates. In addition, the scope of the rights granted under any issued patent that we own or license, now or in the future, may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies that are outside the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents we obtain. For these reasons, we may face competition with respect to our drug candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any particular drug candidate can be commercialized, any patent protection for such product may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides.
In addition to patent protection, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and confidential know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets and confidential information are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with any future collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreement with our employees. We also have agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected consultants, scientific advisors and collaborators. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection. These agreements may also be breached, and we may not have an adequate remedy for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets and/or confidential know-how may become known or be independently developed by a third party or misused by any collaborator to whom we disclose such information. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or drug candidates or obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information, third parties may independently develop the same or similar proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our proprietary information. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”

Collaboration and License Agreement
In December 2019, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Hanmi, a corporation organized under the laws of the Republic of Korea, pursuant to which we granted Hanmi an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize FLX475 and related compounds and products with respect to human cancers in the Republic of Korea, the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People’s Republic of China, including the special administrative regions of Macau and Hong Kong (the “Hanmi Territory”), and certain sublicense rights. In consideration of such rights, under the agreement we received $10.0 million in an upfront payment and milestone payment, and will be eligible to receive (i) additional contingent payments of up to $108.0 million upon the achievement of specified milestones, consisting of up to $48.0 million based on the dosing of the first patient in a Phase 3 clinical trial in the Hanmi Territory and the filing and approval of a new drug application in the Hanmi Territory and up to $60.0 million based on annual net sales, and (ii) low double-digit royalties on future net sales of FLX475 in the Hanmi Territory. Royalties will be payable on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis for a period commencing with the first commercial sale until the latest of (a) the expiration of the relevant patent right, (b) the expiration of regulatory or data exclusivity granted by the applicable governmental authority, and (c) five years from such first commercial sale (such period being the “Royalty Term” for such product and country); provided that the royalties will be reduced (x) by 50% if the product in question is not covered by a valid claim during the Royalty Term in the applicable country, (y) in connection with a license obtained from such third party in order to develop, manufacture or commercialize FLX475 in the Hanmi Territory and (z) by a percentage dependent on any generic products’ market share in the Hanmi Territory. If we sponsor Phase 3 clinical trials for FLX475 for human cancers, Hanmi will have the right to participate in such trials in the Hanmi Territory. We will supply FLX475 for use in Hanmi’s Phase 2 clinical trials and Hanmi will reimburse us for our manufacturing costs. If requested, we will facilitate technology transfer to Hanmi for their manufacture of FLX475 product for Phase 3 trials and commercialization. The term of the agreement will continue until Hanmi’s royalty payment obligations have expired, unless sooner terminated by Hanmi for convenience, safety reasons, if we abandon our development of FLX475 and related products, if we do not consent to Hanmi’s use of FLX475 in any study required by applicable governmental authorities, or breach by us of our representations and warranties under the agreement. The agreement may also be terminated by either party in connection with a material breach by, or insolvency of, the other party. If Hanmi terminates the agreement with cause or for our abandonment of development of FLX475 and related products, material breach or insolvency, Hanmi will retain a perpetual license to certain our intellectual property related to FLX475.
Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement
In November 2018, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with MSD International GmbH, an affiliate of Merck (known as MSD outside the United States and Canada), under which we will conduct a clinical trial evaluating FLX475 as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®), Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, in patients with advanced cancers. In March 2022, we and Merck amended the agreement to provide for additional supply of pembrolizumab. We are the sponsor of the clinical trial and are responsible for the costs of conducting it, and Merck will supply pembrolizumab for use in the clinical trial at no charge to us except that we may be required to reimburse Merck’s manufacturing costs upon certain early termination events. Neither party will have any other obligations to reimburse any costs or expenses incurred by the other party. We retain ownership of the quantities of FLX475 used in the clinical trial and we will own the quantities of pembrolizumab supplied to us by Merck for use in the clinical trial. The agreement provides for joint ownership of any inventions, clinical data and results generated in the clinical trial that relate to the combined use of the two drugs. Merck will solely own any inventions generated in the clinical trial that relate solely to pembrolizumab and all data resulting from testing performed by or on behalf of Merck upon samples collected during the clinical trial. We will solely own any inventions generated in the clinical trial that relate solely to FLX475, clinical data resulting from the use of FLX475 as monotherapy, and from all data resulting from testing performed by or on behalf of us upon samples collected during the clinical trial. The term of the agreement will continue until delivery of the final report for the clinical trial, provided that either party may terminate the agreement due to the other party’s uncured material breach, a violation of anti-corruption obligations, patient safety concerns, regulatory action that prevents supply of such party’s compound, or such party’s termination of its compound’s development or withdrawal of its compound’s regulatory approval. Merck may also terminate the agreement if we fail to make any changes to the clinical trial protocol regarding the use of pembrolizumab that are reasonably requested by Merck to address any concern raised by Merck that pembrolizumab is being used in the clinical trial in an unsafe manner.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including the oncology and inflammatory disease fields, are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, strong competition and an emphasis on intellectual property protection. We face substantial competition from many different sources, including large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. We believe that the key competitive factors affecting the success of any of our drug candidates will include patient selection strategies, efficacy (single and combination strategies), safety profile, method of administration, cost, level of promotional activity and intellectual property protection.
RPT193 is a CCR4 antagonist intended to treat inflammatory disease, including AD and other inflammatory diseases. If approved for AD, we will face branded competition from dupilumab (marketed by Regeneron and Sanofi as Dupixent), a biologic approved in 2017. In addition, there are several companies developing treatments that may be approved for AD, including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies such as Pfizer, Sanofi, Lilly, Incyte, AbbVie and LEO Pharma.
 There are several large and specialty pharmaceutical companies, as well as biotechnology companies with marketed or late-stage assets targeting the Th2 pathway, which includes Amgen, AstraZeneca, Chiesi Farmaceutici, GSK, Novartis, Roche, Sanofi and Teva Pharmaceuticals.
 If approved, FLX475 will compete with current therapies approved for the treatment of cancer, particularly immuno-oncology. Potential immuno-oncology therapeutics are being developed or marketed by many large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies such as Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Novartis, AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Roche/Genentech. Additionally, there is one approved CCR4-targeting Treg-depleting antibody, mogamulizumab developed by Kyowa Hakko Kirin, as well as other Treg-targeting agents currently in early development by companies such as ChemoCentryx, Tusk/Roche and Agenus/Gilead.
Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trials sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
Government Regulation
 Our business activities are subject to various laws, rules and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position, and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to product development and approval, business acquisitions, healthcare, consumer and data protection, employee health and safety and taxes, could have a material impact on our business in subsequent periods. Refer to the sections captioned “Risk Factors” under Part I, Item IA and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under Part II, Item 7 for a discussion of these potential impacts.
The Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of drug products such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our drug candidates.

The process required by the FDA before drug candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”), regulation; 
 •submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”), which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made; 
 •approval by an independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced; 
 •
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug candidate for its intended purpose; 
 •preparation of and submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) after completion of all pivotal clinical trials; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable; 
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the application for review; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”); and 
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States. 
 Preclinical and Clinical Development
Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a drug candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical trials. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
For purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.
•Phase 1—The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
 •Phase 2—The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. Some trials may combine aspects of Phase 1 and Phase 2 into a single clinical trial, which we refer to as a “seamless” study that can examine both safety in healthy volunteers and safety and preliminary efficacy in patients with a specific disease. 
 •Phase 3—The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. 
 A registrational trial is a clinical trial that adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidate’s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the drug. Generally, registrational trials are Phase 3 trials but may be Phase 2 trials if the trial design provides a reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need.
In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of the NDA. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the characteristics of the drug candidate and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

NDA Submission and Review
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The NDA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. A determination by the FDA within 60 days of the receipt of an NDA to file the application for review for its completeness is initiated at the time of submission. If the FDA determines there is significance to the missing or incomplete information in the context of the proposed drug product, the proposed indication(s) and the amount of time needed to address any given deficiency, it can issue a refusal-to-file letter. The submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies.
Once an NDA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
After the FDA evaluates an NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the product will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the NDA. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the NDA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use and could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.

Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA offers several expedited development and review programs for qualifying drug candidates. The fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product has opportunities for frequent interactions with the review team during product development and, once an NDA is submitted, the product may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
A product intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product, including involvement of senior managers.
Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition compared to marketed products. For products containing new molecular entities, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (compared with ten months under standard review).
Additionally, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires, as a condition for accelerated approval, pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process.

If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the application user fee.
A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved NDA. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 •fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals; 
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products; or 
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics and drugs. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising

and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
A therapeutic product may rely upon an in vitro companion diagnostic for use in selecting the patients that will be more likely to respond to that therapy. If an in vitro diagnostic is essential to the safe and effective use of the therapeutic product, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. According to FDA guidance, a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a drug generally will be considered an investigational device unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”), regulations. Thus, the sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a drug are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational trial if the trial meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the trial plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND alone or both an IND and an IDE.
Pursuing FDA approval of an in vitro companion diagnostic would require either a pre-market notification, also called 510(k) clearance, or a pre-market approval (“PMA”) for that diagnostic. The review of companion diagnostics involves coordination of review with the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and nonclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. The applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness, including information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. In addition, PMAs for devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
The term of a patent depends upon the laws of the country in which it is issued. In most jurisdictions, a patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of our drug candidates, one or more issued U.S. patents we obtain may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years beyond the normal expiration of the patent, limited to the approved indication (or any additional indications approved during the period of extension), as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The patent term restoration period granted on a patent covering a product is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the ultimate approval date of that application. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for extension and only those claims covering the approved product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Additionally, the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or

restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restoration of patent term for an issued patent we own and, if eligible for such restoration, to add patent term beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will be issued or that we will benefit from any patent term extension.
Marketing exclusivity provisions under the United States Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications for competing products. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) or 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, which were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) applications for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year a three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Orphan drug exclusivity, as described below, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
European Drug Development
In Europe, our future drugs may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in Europe are subject to significant regulatory controls. Clinical Trials Regulation 536/2014 seeks to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. For example, the sponsor shall submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial via the EU Portal. As part of the application process, the sponsor shall propose a reporting Member State who will coordinate the validation and evaluation of the application. The reporting Member State shall consult and coordinate with the other concerned Member States. If an application is rejected, it can be amended and resubmitted through the EU Portal. If an approval is issued, the sponsor can start the clinical trial in all concerned Member States. However, a concerned Member State can in limited circumstances declare an “opt-out” from an approval. In such a case, the clinical trial cannot be conducted in that Member State. The Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting and introduces enhanced transparency requirements such as mandatory submission of a summary of the clinical trial results to the EU Database.
European Drug Review and Approval
In the European Economic Area (“EEA”), which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (“MA”). There are two types of marketing authorizations.

The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) of the EMA and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of drugs, such as biotechnology medicinal drugs, orphan medicinal drugs and medicinal drugs containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for drugs containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA or for drugs that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union.
National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for drugs not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a drug has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in other Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the drug has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure, an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (“RMS”). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the drug characteristics (“SPC”), and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (“Member States Concerned”) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the drug is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).
Under the above-described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the drug on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
European Chemical Entity Exclusivity
In Europe, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
Data Privacy and Security
 In the ordinary course of business, we collect, receive, store, process, generate, use, transfer, disclose, make accessible, protect, secure, dispose of, transmit and share (collectively, process) personal information, such as clinical trial data and other health data. Accordingly, we may be subject to numerous data privacy and security obligations, including federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, guidance, industry standards, external and internal privacy and security policies, contractual requirements and other obligations related to data privacy and security.

These frameworks are evolving and may impose potentially conflicting obligations. Such obligations may include, without limitation, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”) (collectively, “CCPA”), the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“EU GDPR”), the EU GDPR as it forms part of United Kingdom law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK GDPR”), the ePrivacy Directive and wiretapping laws. Further, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), imposes specific requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. In addition, several U.S. states, such as Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut and Utah, have enacted comprehensive data privacy laws, and similar laws are being considered at the federal, state and local levels.
 We may also be subject to privacy regimes in other jurisdictions in Asia, including the Personal Information Protection Act (“PIPA”) in the Republic of Korea, Taiwan's Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”), Thailand's Personal Data Protection Act (“TPDPA”) and Hong Kong's Personal Data Privacy Ordinance (“PDPO”).
 The EU GDPR, UK GDPR and CCPA are examples of the increasingly stringent and evolving regulatory frameworks related to personal information processing that may increase our compliance obligations and exposure for any noncompliance. European data privacy and security laws (including the EU GDPR and UK GDPR) impose significant and complex compliance obligations on companies that are subject to those laws, notably with respect to the processing of health-related data from EEA or UK-based individuals.
Additionally, the CCPA applies to personal information of consumers, business representatives and employees who are California residents, imposes specific obligations on covered businesses, provides for administrative fines of up to $7,500 per violation and allows private litigants affected by certain data breaches to recover significant statutory damages. In addition, the CPRA expanded the CCPA’s requirements.
Rest of the World Regulation
For other countries outside of the European Union and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, drug licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of our drugs will depend, in part, on the extent to which our drugs will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical drugs and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic drugs.
There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside of the United States. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, intellectual property protection, manufacture, sale and distribution expenses. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement

levels already set for lower-cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for our drug candidates, once approved, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 We plan to develop, either by ourselves or with collaborators, in vitro companion diagnostic tests for our drug candidates for certain indications. We, or our collaborators, will be required to obtain coverage and reimbursement for these tests separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement we seek for our drug candidates, once approved.
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal drugs for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal drugs for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal drug or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal drug on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical drugs will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our drugs. Historically, drugs launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States there have been, and continue to be, proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control or manage the increased costs of healthcare and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. The biopharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (“ACA”) was enacted, which was intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms, and substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry.
There have been executive, judicial and Congressional efforts to modify, repeal or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the ACA. For example, on June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”), into law, which, among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is unclear how any future challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA.

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted to reduce healthcare expenditures. The Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will remain in effect until 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Moreover, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 Recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which biopharmaceutical manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these principles. In addition, the IRA, among other things, (i) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare, and subjects drug manufacturers to civil monetary penalties and a potential excise tax by offering a price that is not equal to or less than the negotiated “maximum fair price” for such drugs and biologics under the law, and (ii) imposes rebates with respect to certain drugs and biologics covered under Medicare Part B or Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. The IRA permits HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. It is currently unclear how the IRA will be implemented but is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Further, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to submit a report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. It is unclear whether this executive order or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 Other Healthcare Laws
We may also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments where we may market our drug candidates, if approved. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations. In the past, the government has enforced the federal Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions and, in some cases, may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.

Additionally, the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties law, prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the United States, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
 HIPAA also created additional federal civil and criminal penalties for, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
There has also been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The ACA, through the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, imposed new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments and other transfers of value made by them to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physicians assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Drug manufacturers are required to submit annual reports to the government and these reports are posted on a website maintained by CMS. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, additional reporting obligations and oversight obligations, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
