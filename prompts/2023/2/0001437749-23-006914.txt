Overview
 
Our Company
 
We are a specialty ingredient and milling company that produces nutritional and functional ingredients derived from rice and other small and ancient grains for the nutraceutical, healthy food, companion animal and equine feed categories. Notably, we are a market leader in North America in converting raw rice bran into stabilized rice bran (SRB) and high value SRB derivative products including:

● | RiBalance, a complete rice bran nutritional package derived from further processing SRB;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | RiSolubles, a highly nutritious, carbohydrate and lipid rich fraction of RiBalance;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | RiFiber, a protein and fiber rich insoluble derivative of RiBalance; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our family of ProRyza products, which includes derivatives composed of protein and protein/fiber blends.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have developed our products by optimizing proprietary processes. Our products are healthy, natural, and non-genetically modified ingredients that are hypoallergenic and gluten free for use in baked goods, cereals, coatings, health foods, high-end animal nutrition, and animal health. Our customer include food and animal nutrition manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers, both domestic and international.
 
We incorporated under the laws of the State of California in 2000. From July 2003 until October 2012, our corporate name was “NutraCea.” In October 2012, we changed our name to “RiceBran Technologies”. In 2018, we moved our corporate headquarters to Texas, from Arizona.
 
We produce SRB at four locations: two raw rice bran stabilization facilities located within supplier-owned rice mills in Arbuckle and West Sacramento, California, one company-owned rice bran stabilization facility in Mermentau, Louisiana, and our wholly owned rice mill in Wynne, Arkansas.
 
We further process SRB into high-value SRB derivatives at our Dillon, Montana facility using proprietary equipment and technology. Our primary products include: RiSolubles, RiFiber, RiBalance, in both organic and conventional formats, and our ProRyza family of products.
 
We own and operate two specialty mills: a rice mill and bran stabilization facility in Wynne, Arkansas operated be Golden Ridge Rice Mills, Inc. (Golden Ridge), acquired in 2018; and a grain mill and processing facility in East Grand Forks, Minnesota operated by MGI Grain, Incorporated (MGI), acquired in 2019.
 
Stabilized RiceBran (SRB)
 
As the leading supplier of SRB, we believe our greatest market opportunities are in the food ingredient and animal nutrition markets. Nutritionally balanced, minimally processed, gluten free, non-GMO and clean-label food and animal feed ingredients are in high demand, and we are strategically positioned to take advantage of this growing and sustainable market opportunity.
 
Food Ingredients
 
Our SRB and SRB derivative products are nutritional and beneficial food products that contain a unique combination of oil, protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, fibers, and antioxidants that enhance the nutritional value of popular consumer products. Our products replace ingredients like soy protein isolate, soy protein concentrate, modified food starch, pea protein, mustard flour and yeast at a significantly reduced cost. Foods that are ideally suited for the addition of our SRB to their products include processed meats, cereals, snacks, beverages, baked goods, breading, and batters.

Animal Nutrition
 
Our SRB is marketed as a feed ingredient in the United States and international animal nutrition markets, and we will continue to pursue sales opportunities with attractive margins in those markets. SRB is currently used as an equine feed ingredient as it has been shown to provide health benefits for show and performance horses. We believe that there are also numerous market opportunities for utilizing SRB in the production of food for companion animals. We have multiple engagements with customers in the companion animal market, and we are aggressively pursuing other opportunities.
Rice Bran
 
Rice is the staple food for over half of the world’s population, especially in some of the world’s most populous countries. Asia accounts for roughly 90% of global rice production and China is the world’s number one rice producer. Globally, the United States ranks 12th in rice production with approximately 1% of the global total.
 
After harvest, individual rice kernels are stored in common receiving locations such as farm silos for future delivery to grain dryers or area rice mills. At this stage, large quantities of individual rice kernels are collectively called “paddy rice,” or “rough” rice. In this form, the rice kernel is fully enveloped by the rice hull, which serves as a protective cover, shielding the inner rice kernel from damage.
 
After storage and drying, paddy rice is cleaned of foreign material (scalping, de-stoning and aspiration). The paddy husker then uses differential speed rubber rollers to remove the hulls from rough rice. Aspiration carries off the loosened hulls, and the normal brown rice kernels (caryopsis) are separated from the unhusked kernels which are returned to the paddy husker.
 
Once husked, the outer brown layers of bran are removed from the inner white starch endosperm by an abrasive or frictional milling process producing a milled white rice kernel. After milling, white rice is typically sorted by size to remove broken kernels from whole kernels, and by color to remove discolored kernels. Further processing may also be used to polish the white rice for a smooth surface.
 
Raw rice bran collected from the milling process is composed of rice germ and several sub-layers (pericarp, testa, nucellus and aleurone) surrounding the white starchy endosperm. Commercial rice bran makes up approximately 10% of rough rice by weight. Rice germ, an especially nutrient rich material, makes up approximately 10% of commercial rice bran by weight.
 
In the milling process the oils present in raw rice bran come into contact with native lipase enzymes that are naturally present in the rice kernel which initiate a rapid enzymatic hydrolysis of the oil, converting oils (triglycerides) into monoglycerides, diglycerides and free fatty acids (FFA). As the FFA content builds in raw rice bran, the bran becomes unpalatable and off flavors (rancidity) develop.
 
If left unchecked, enzymatic degradation at room temperatures can increase the FFA levels to 5-8% within 24 hours continuing at a rate of approximately 4-5% per day thereafter. Rice bran stabilization deactivates the native enzymes to prevent the increase of FFA otherwise caused by lipase enzyme activity. Proper stabilization is critical in the preservation of the nutritional value of the bran.
 
Historically, there have been a number of attempts to develop rice bran stabilization techniques, including the use of chemicals, microwave heating or variations of existing extrusion technology. Many of these approaches have had limited success in part because they have produced rice bran with limited shelf life or with significant degradation of nutrients.
 
Rice Bran Stabilization
 
We stabilize rice bran with proprietary processes to create a combination of temperature, pressure and other conditions necessary to thoroughly deactivate enzymes without significantly damaging the structure or nutrient content of the raw rice bran, leaving the higher value compounds in bran, such as oils, proteins and phytonutrients undamaged and are available for utilization.
 
Our stabilizers are located in close proximity to the rice mills where we source raw bran so that the raw bran can be delivered quickly. We maintain exact process conditions within a prescribed pressure/temperature regime and have the ability to purge our equipment of material in the event of power failure or interruption of the flow of fresh bran into the system.
 
Once stabilized, SRB leaving our system is then discharged onto cooling units specifically designed to control air pressure and humidity. Once cooled, SRB can be loaded into bulk hopper trucks for large volume customers or sent by pneumatic conveyor to a bagging unit for packaging into various size bags or 2,000-pound sacks.
 
We operate stabilizers of our own design which we believe offer certain advantages. Each stabilizer processes approximately 2,000 pounds of bran per hour and has a capacity to produce over 7,200 tons of SRB per year. Stabilization production capacity can be doubled, tripled or further multiplied by installing additional units sharing a common conveyor and stage system.

SRB can be further processed to produce fractions enriched in one or more macronutrients, including proteins, fibers, lipids and micronutrients such as vitamins, minerals and phytosterols, among others. In these processes, SRB is put into an aqueous slurry, treated with one or more enzymes, centrifugally separated and the fractions are dried.
 
SRB Attributes
 
Rice bran is free of all major allergens and is a valuable source of protein with a balanced amino acid profile for food ingredient products and is rich in healthy oil, vitamins, antioxidants, dietary fiber and other nutrients. The approximate composition and caloric content of our SRB is as follows:
 

Fat (oil) | 18-23% 
--------------------+--------------
Protein | 12-16% 
Total Dietary Fiber | 20-30% 
Moisture | 4-8% 
Ash | 6-14% 
Calories | 3.2 kcal/gram

 
Because SRB contains approximately 18-23% oil, it has a favorable fatty acid composition and excellent heat stability which makes it an attractive ingredient for a wide variety of applications.
 
Specialty Milling 
 
Rice Mill
 
Our Golden Ridge rice mill and bran stabilization facility is located on nearly 32 acres in Wynne, Arkansas. Golden Ridge provides a presence in the largest rice-producing state and a cost-efficient source of SRB close to customers in the Midwest and Eastern U.S. Golden Ridge produces U.S. No. 1 and U.S. No. 2 Grade U.S. premium long and medium white rice milled to USDA standards. Golden Ridge adheres to standard operating procedures and passed all the prerequisite audits required to meet Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards and Safe Quality Food (SQF) certifications.
Barley and Oats Mill
 
Our MGI grain mill and processing facility in East Grand Forks, Minnesota specializes in processing barley, oats, and mustard. MGI provides us a presence in a key production region in the U.S. and a complimentary portfolio of ingredients purchased by substantially the same buyers as our rice products. MGI’s facility is an American Institute of Baking (AIB) certified barley pearling facility, Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) and SQF certified.
Intellectual Property
 
Our stabilization processes are an adaptation of standard food processing technology applied to rice bran. We have chosen to treat our methods and processes as a trade secret and not to pursue process or process equipment patents on the original processes. As we develop improvements, we intend to periodically review whether we should seek patent protection for them. We believe that certain unique products, and their biological effects, resulting from our SRB may be patentable in the future.
Market Opportunity 
 
There is an expanding market for minimally processed plant-based ingredients that provide dense and balanced nutrition as well as high functionality while being non-GMO, gluten and allergen free. Regulatory requirements to add front-of-label warnings on food items and increasing demand from consumers for less processed ingredients is driving a shift to cleaner ingredients. We anticipate further adoption of our ingredients by food companies as a result, with a corresponding transition among high-end animal nutrition companies.
Our Customers
 
We use internal sales staff, outside independent sales representatives and third-party distributors to market our portfolio of products to customers domestically and internationally. In 2022 and 2021, three customers accounted for 29.2% and 32.4% of our revenues. We continue to focus efforts on diversification of our customer base to mitigate the concentration of customers.

Government Regulations
 
Our operations are subject to federal, foreign, state and local government laws and regulations, including those relating to zoning, workplace safety and accommodations for the disabled, and our relationships with our employees are subject to regulations, including minimum wage requirements, anti-discrimination laws, overtime and working conditions and citizenship requirements.
 
In both our U.S. and foreign markets, we are affected by extensive laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations, court decisions and similar constraints. Such laws, regulations and other constraints exist at the federal, state and local levels in the U.S., and at all levels of government in foreign jurisdictions, including to the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, sale and storage of our products. We are also subject to regulations regarding product claims and advertising.
 
The formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, distribution and sale of our products are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies, including the Food & Drug Administration (FDA), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the USDA. We are also regulated by various states and local agencies where our products are manufactured and/or sold, as well as a host of agencies outside the U.S. Among other matters, the FDA and FTC are concerned with product safety and claims made with respect to a product’s ability to provide health-related benefits. The FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), regulates the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution and sale of food and food ingredients, while the FTC regulates their advertising.
 
Federal agencies, including the FDA and the FTC, have a variety of enforcement remedies, including investigations, issuing warning letters and cease-and-desist orders, requiring corrective labeling or advertising, requiring consumer redress such as requiring that a company offer to repurchase products previously sold, seeking injunctive relief or product seizures, imposing civil penalties or commencing criminal prosecution. Certain state agencies have similar authority. These federal and state agencies have in the past used these remedies in regulating participants in the food and food ingredient industries, including the imposition of civil penalties.
 
The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), enacted January 4, 2011, amended the FDCA to significantly enhance the FDA’s authority over various aspects of food regulation. The FSMA granted the FDA mandatory recall authority when the FDA determines there is a reasonable probability that a food is adulterated or misbranded and that the use of, or exposure to, the food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals. One of the more significant changes under FSMA is the requirement of hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls (HARPC) for all human and animal food processing facilities. We are committed to FSMA compliance and are SQF certified at all our facilities.
 
Any substance that is intentionally added to food is a food additive and is subject to premarket review and approval by the FDA, unless the substance is generally recognized, among qualified experts, as having been adequately shown to be safe under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the use of the substance is otherwise excluded from the definition of a food additive. When an additive is proposed for use in a meat, its safety, technical function and conditions of use must also be evaluated by the USDA. Because the USDA retains jurisdiction over meat products and food ingredients intended for use in meats, the use of our SRB meat enhancers is regulated by this agency. SRB has USDA approval for use in certain meat products.
 
Animal feed ingredients are regulated by the FDA at the federal level and by the individual states. Our SRB is defined for animal use as heat stabilized rice bran for use as a feed ingredient.
 
Competition 
 
Recently, we have seen increased competition from companies that have invested significant resources to develop technologies for stabilizing and processing rice bran. We believe that we have proprietary technologies and processes for stabilizing rice bran, as well as significant brand recognition in the animal feed and food ingredient sectors both domestically and internationally. We also believe that we have industry-leading manufacturing facilities. However, we believe that increased competition negatively impacted our financial results in 2022 and is likely to continue to impact us negatively in the foreseeable future.
 
We are also aware of several new producers of rice-based animal nutrition and food ingredient products in the United States, Europe and Asia. We believe that our major competitors include producers of isolated soy protein, wheat bran and oat bran, particularly in the food ingredients market segment. We compete with other companies that offer products incorporating SRB as well as companies that offer other food ingredients. Many consumers may consider such products to be a replacement for our products.
 
Human Capital
 
We employ a skilled workforce within a broad range of functions. As of December 31, 2022, we had 94 employees. Our employees are located throughout the United States to serve our business operations. From year to year, we experience normal variable labor fluctuation at our production facilities.
 
    7 

  

We attract and retain our workforce through a dynamic and inclusive culture by providing a safe work environment, flexible work arrangements, and competitive pay and benefits, including access to personal health advocates offering independent guidance. We believe that we have positive relationships with our employees and have deployed programs that advance employee engagement, communication, and feedback. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
