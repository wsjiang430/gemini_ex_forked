ITEM 1.         BUSINESS
DESCRIPTION OF THE WILHELMINA BUSINESS
 
Overview
 
The primary business of Wilhelmina is fashion model management. These business operations are headquartered in New York City. The Company’s predecessor was founded in 1967 by Wilhelmina Cooper, a renowned fashion model, and became one of the oldest, best known and largest fashion model management companies in the world. Since its founding, Wilhelmina has grown to include operations located in Los Angeles, Miami, and London, as well as a network of licensees. Wilhelmina provides traditional, full-service fashion model and talent management services, specializing in the representation and management of models, entertainers, athletes and other talent to various clients, including retailers, designers, advertising agencies, print and electronic media and catalog companies. The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1996.
Organization and Operating Divisions
 
The Company acquired the predecessor companies constituting its current primary business in 2008. The Company conducts its business through operating divisions and subsidiaries engaged in fashion model management and other complementary businesses. These business activities are focused on the following key areas:

● | Fashion model and social media influencer management
--+-----------------------------------------------------


● | Celebrity management
--+---------------------


● | Licensing and branding associations
--+------------------------------------

Fashion Model and Social Media Influencer Management
 
Wilhelmina is focused on providing fashion modeling talent and social media influencer services to clients such as advertising agencies, branded consumer goods companies, fashion designers, Internet sites, retailers, department stores, product catalogs and magazine publications.
 
The fashion model/talent/influencer management industry can be divided into many subcategories, including advertising campaigns, catalog/e-commerce, runway, showroom and editorial work. Advertising work involves modeling for advertisements featuring consumer products such as cosmetics, clothing and other items to be placed in magazines and newspapers, on billboards and with other types of media. Catalog and e-commerce work involves modeling of products to be sold through promotional catalogs and Internet commerce sites. Runway work involves modeling at fashion shows, which primarily take place in Paris, Milan, London and New York City. Showroom work involves on-site modeling of products at client showrooms and other events and production “fit” work whereby a model serves as the sizing model for apparel items. Editorial work involves modeling for the cover and editorial sections of magazines and websites.

Clients pay for talent to appear in photo shoots for Internet sites, magazine features, print advertising, direct mail marketing, and product catalogs, as well as to appear in runway shows to present new designer collections, fit modeling, and on-location presentations and events.  In addition, talent may also appear in film and television commercials. Wilhelmina develops and diversifies its talent portfolio through a combination of ongoing local, regional and international scouting and talent-search efforts to source new talent, as well as cooperating with other agencies that represent talent.
 
Within its fashion model management business, Wilhelmina’s primary source of service revenue is from model fees and services charges paid by the client for bookings directly negotiated by the Company. The Company also receives commissions paid on bookings by third-party agencies. Wilhelmina believes that its model fees, service charges and commission rates are competitive with those of its principal competitors.
 
Wilhelmina’s fashion model management operations are organized into divisions called “boards,” each of which specializes by the type of models it represents. Wilhelmina’s boards are generally described in the table below.
 

Board Name | Location | Target Market 
-----------+------------------------+--------------------------------------------------
Women | NYC, LA, Miami, London | High-end female fashion models 
Men | NYC, LA, Miami, London | High-end male fashion models 
Direct | NYC, LA, Miami, London | Established/commercial male/female fashion models
Curve | NYC, LA, Miami, London | Full-figured female fashion models 
Showroom | NYC, LA, Miami | Live modeling and designer fit clothing modeling 
Fitness | NYC, LA, Miami | Athletic models 

 
Each major board is headed by a director who manages the agents assigned to the board. The agents of each board act both as bookers (including promoting models, negotiating fees and contracting work) and as talent scouts/managers (including providing models with career and development guidance and helping them better market themselves). Although agents individually develop professional relationships with models, models are represented by a board collectively and not by a specific agent. Wilhelmina’s organization into boards enables Wilhelmina to provide clients with services tailored to their particular needs, to allow models to benefit from agents’ specialized experience in their particular markets, and to limit Wilhelmina’s dependency on any specialty market or agent.
 
Most senior agents are employed pursuant to employment agreements that include noncompetition provisions such as a prohibition from working with Wilhelmina’s models and clients for a certain period of time after the end of the agent’s employment with Wilhelmina. Wilhelmina typically signs its models to three-year exclusive contracts, which it actively enforces.
 
The Aperture division operates in New York, Los Angeles and Miami, representing actors and models, for film, television, and commercials. Aperture also represents influencers for brand campaigns and endorsements. 
 
Wilhelmina London Limited (“London”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Wilhelmina International, Inc., was acquired in January 2015. The London subsidiary establishes a footprint for the Company in Western Europe, provides a base of operations to service the Company’s European clients, and serves as a new talent development office for European models and artists.
 
Celebrity Management
 
Wilhelmina’s Celebrity division seeks to secure endorsement and spokesperson work for celebrities from the worlds of sports, music and entertainment. The Celebrity division has two primary sources of revenue: (i) commissions paid by talent as a percentage of their gross earnings; and (ii) royalties or a service charge paid by clients. Wilhelmina’s Celebrity division management works with emerging artists and established celebrity names to match them with leading fashion brands and companies.
Licensing & Branding Associations
 
Wilhelmina Licensing, LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary that collects third-party licensing fees in connection with the licensing of the “Wilhelmina” name. Third-party licensees include leading fashion model agencies in local markets in the U.S. and internationally. The film and television business consists of occasional television syndication royalties and production series contracts. Also, from time to time, the Company conducts other events, such as model search contests, in an effort to expand the Wilhelmina brand and recruit talent.

Competition
 
The fashion model/talent management business is highly competitive. New York City, Los Angeles, and Miami, as well as London, Paris, and Milan, are considered the most important markets for the fashion talent management industry.  Most of the leading international firms are headquartered in New York City. Wilhelmina’s principal competitors include other large fashion model management businesses in the U.S., including IMG Models, Elite Model Management, Ford Models, Inc., DNA Model Management, NEXT Model Management, The Lions Model Management, The Society Management, Women 360 Management, and New York Model Management. However, Wilhelmina is the only publicly-owned fashion talent management company in the world.
 
Competition also includes foreign agencies and smaller U.S. agencies in local markets that recruit local talent and cater to local market needs.  Several of the larger fashion talent firms operate offices in multiple cities and countries or have chosen to partner with local or foreign agencies.
 
The Company believes that its sources of revenue, mainly generated from commissions and service charges, are comparable to those of its principal competitors.  Therefore, for the Company to obtain a competitive advantage, it must develop and maintain a deep pool of talent and deliver high quality service to its clients.  The Company believes that through its scouting efforts, name recognition, and licensing network, it is able to recruit a deeper pool of talent relative to its competitors. These recruitment tools, coupled with the broad range of fashion boards available to the Company’s talent, enable the Company to develop talent and generate a broader range of revenues relative to its principal competitors. While a broad range of talent and boards provides a level of stability to the business, certain talent may be more inclined to work with a boutique agency that may appear to tailor more specifically to their needs.
 
For more than 55 years, Wilhelmina and its predecessors have created long-standing client relationships and business activities related to the fashion model management business that provide exposure to diverse markets and demographics. The Company has also developed a professional workforce with years of talent management experience.
 
Clients and Customers
 
As of December 31, 2022, Wilhelmina represented a roster of approximately 1,600 active models and talent. Wilhelmina’s active models include Karolína Kurková, Ana Maria Figueroa, Francisco Lachowski, Daniel Shin, Douglas Dillon, Fernando Cabral, Hella Tall, Asya Rosh, Yumi Nu, Francisco Henriques, Aubrey Hill, Astrid Voss, Elvina Patrick, Lamich Kirabo, Penny Lane, Kylie Lauren, Jessieann Lachowski, Africa Perez, Carmen Fozzard, Carla Pereira, Bojana Krsmanović, Cyrielle Lalande, Mitchell Slaggert, Anne de Paula, Jan Baiboon, Ottawa Efoe, Rainer Andreesen, Erik Van Gils, Kate King, Malik Lindo, Malcolm Jackson, Milena Feuerer, Haejin Lee, Moon Young, Isabela Grutman, Sabey Dantsira, Lauren Auerbach, Davidson Obennebo, Sasha Melnychuk, Armando Cabral, Jennae Quisenberry, Vanessa Cruz, Pure, Akito Mizutani, Mariana Dantec, Nayara Oliveira, Fernando Lindez, Dachuan Jin, Claudio Monteiro, and Nathan Owens.
 
Wilhelmina serves approximately 2,700 external clients. Wilhelmina’s customer base is highly diversified, with no one customer accounting for more than 3% of overall gross revenues. The top 100 clients of Wilhelmina together accounted for approximately 34.1% of overall gross revenues during 2022.
Governmental Regulations
 
Certain jurisdictions in which Wilhelmina operates, such as California and Florida, require that companies maintain a Talent Agency License in order to engage in the “talent agency” business. The talent agency business is generally considered the business of procuring engagements or any employment or placement of a talent, where the talent performs in his or her artistic capacity.  Where required, the Wilhelmina subsidiaries operating in these jurisdictions maintain Talent Agency Licenses issued by those jurisdictions.  
Trends and Opportunities
 
The Company expects that the combination of Wilhelmina’s main operating base in New York City, the industry’s capital, with the depth and breadth of its talent pool, client roster and its diversification across various talent management segments, together with its name recognition and geographical reach, should make Wilhelmina’s operations more resilient to industry changes and economic swings than those of many of the smaller firms operating in the industry. Similarly, in the segments where Wilhelmina competes with other leading full service agencies, Wilhelmina believes it competed successfully in 2022.

With total advertising expenditures on major media (television, Internet, outdoor, cinema, magazines, and newspapers) estimated to have exceeded $280 billion in 2022, North America is the world’s largest advertising market.  For the fashion talent management industry, including Wilhelmina, advertising expenditures on television, Internet, magazines, and outdoor are of particular relevance.

TRADEMARKS AND LICENSING
 
The “Wilhelmina” brand is essential to the success and competitive position of the Company. The “Wilhelmina” trademark is vital to the licensing business because licensees pay for the right to use the trademark. The Company has invested significant resources in the “Wilhelmina” brands in order to obtain the public recognition that these brands currently enjoy. Wilhelmina relies upon domestic and international trademark laws, license agreements and nondisclosure agreements to protect the “Wilhelmina” brand name used in its business. Trademarks registered in the U.S. have a duration of ten years and are generally subject to an indefinite number of renewals for a like period on continued use and appropriate application.
