ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Unless the context otherwise requires, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, "INNOVATE," means INNOVATE Corp. and the "Company," "we" and "our" mean INNOVATE together with its consolidated subsidiaries. 
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements. See "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."
General
INNOVATE is a diversified holding company that has a portfolio of subsidiaries in a variety of operating segments. We seek to grow these businesses so that they can generate long-term sustainable free cash flow and attractive returns in order to maximize value for all stakeholders. As of December 31, 2022, our three operating platforms or reportable segments, based on management’s organization of the enterprise, are Infrastructure, Life Sciences and Spectrum, plus our Other segment, which includes businesses that do not meet the separately reportable segment thresholds.
Our principal operating subsidiaries include the following assets:
(i)DBM Global Inc. ("DBMG") (Infrastructure), a family of companies providing fully integrated structural and steel construction services;
(ii)Pansend Life Sciences, LLC ("Pansend") (Life Sciences), our subsidiary focused on supporting healthcare and biotechnology product development; 
(iii)HC2 Broadcasting Holdings Inc. and its subsidiaries ("Broadcasting") (Spectrum), a strategic operator of Over-The-Air ("OTA") broadcasting stations across the United States ("U.S.") including Puerto Rico; and
(iv)Other, which represents all other businesses or investments that do not meet the definition of a segment individually or in the aggregate. 
We expect to focus on operating and managing our portfolio of companies and building value in Infrastructure, Life Sciences and Spectrum in the future. We believe these segments are well positioned to take advantage of current trends in today’s economy and that there is opportunity to build value organically and inorganically in these three segments. We may consider opportunities outside of these businesses in the longer term to acquire and invest in businesses with attractive assets that we consider to be undervalued or fairly valued.
Overall Business Strategy
We continually evaluate strategic and business alternatives within our operating segments, which may include the following: operating, growing or acquiring additional assets or businesses related to current or historical operations; or winding down or selling our existing operations. In the longer-term, we may evaluate opportunities to acquire assets or businesses unrelated to our current or historical operations. We have generally pursued either controlling positions in durable, cash-flow generating businesses, assets that will enhance our current businesses in Infrastructure, Life Sciences and Spectrum or companies we believe exhibit substantial growth potential, which may be unrelated to the Company’s then-current operating segments. In connection with any such acquisition, we may choose to actively assemble or re-assemble a company’s management team to ensure the appropriate expertise is in place to execute the operating objectives of such business. We view ourselves as strategic and financial partners and seek to align our management teams’ incentives with our goal of delivering sustainable long-term value to our stakeholders.
As part of any acquisition strategy, we may raise capital in the form of debt or equity securities (including preferred stock) or a combination thereof. We have broad discretion in selecting a business strategy for the Company. If we elect to pursue an acquisition, while we intend to focus on Infrastructure, Life Science and Spectrum, we may exercise our broad discretion to identify and select an industry and the possible acquisition or business combination opportunity unrelated to our current operating segments. In connection with evaluating these strategic and business alternatives, we may at any time be engaged in ongoing discussions with respect to possible acquisitions, business combinations and debt or equity securities offerings of widely varying sizes. There can be no assurance that any of these discussions will result in a definitive agreement and, if they do, what the terms or timing of any agreement would be.
Our strategic process includes a continual evaluation of our existing businesses which may include a sale of businesses or operating segments. We consider many factors as we go through our evaluation, which include but are not limited to market factors and opportunity, growth prospects and internal needs. In connection with evaluating these strategic and business alternatives, we may at any time be engaged in ongoing discussions with respect to possible dispositions, mergers and public offerings of widely varying sizes. There can be no assurance that any of these discussions will result in a definitive agreement and if they do, what the terms or timing of any agreement would be. 
Competition
From a strategic perspective, we encounter competition for acquisition and business opportunities from other entities having similar business objectives, such as strategic investors and private equity firms, which could lead to higher prices for acquisition targets. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and executing transactions directly or through affiliates. Our financial resources and human resources may be relatively limited when contrasted with many of these competitors which may place us at a competitive disadvantage. Competitive conditions affecting our operating businesses are described in the discussions below.
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we had 3,565 full-time employees and 196 part-time employees, including the employees of our operating businesses as described in more detail below. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
Our Operating Subsidiaries
Infrastructure Segment (DBMG)
DBM Global Inc. (“DBMG”) is a fully integrated construction company offering both construction and professional services primarily through its core subsidiaries, Schuff Steel Company ("SSC"), Banker Steel (“Banker”) and GrayWolf Industrial (“GrayWolf”) to a wide variety of commercial and industrial market segments. These companies provide services to their clients including design-assist, modularization, fabrication and erection of structural steel, heavy steel plate, trusses and girders, heavy equipment installation, as well as facility services for maintenance and shutdowns. The companies enable best delivery of preconstruction, construction and operations services by, leveraging the capabilities of the DBM Vircon (“Vircon”) business, which provides construction modeling, rebar and steel detailing, industrial design, and digital engineering services. In addition, through its Aitken business ("Aitken"), DBMG manufactures pressure vessels, strainers, filters, separators and a variety of customized products.
DBMG provides these services on commercial, industrial, and infrastructure construction projects such as high- and low-rise buildings and office complexes, hotels and casinos, convention centers, sports arenas and stadiums, hospital and medical offices, data centers, renewables, chemical, pulp and paper mills, manufacturing facilities, bridges, mines, metal processing and power plants. 
Headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, DBMG has domestic operations in Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Washington with construction projects primarily located in the aforementioned states. In addition, DBMG has international operations in Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand, and the United Kingdom.
DBMG’s results of operations are affected primarily by (i) the level of commercial, industrial and infrastructure construction as well as the need for mechanical and maintenance services in its principal markets; (ii) its ability to win project contracts; (iii) the number and complexity of project changes requested by customers or general contractors; (iv) its success in utilizing its resources at or near full capacity; and (v) its ability to complete contracts on a timely and cost-effective basis. The level of commercial, industrial and infrastructure construction activity is related to several factors, including local, regional and national economic conditions, interest rates, availability of financing, and the supply of existing facilities relative to demand.
Strategy
DBMG’s objective is to achieve and maintain a leading position in the geographic regions and project segments that it serves by providing timely, high-quality services to its customers. DBMG pursues this objective with a strategy comprised of the following components:
•Pursue Large, Value-Added Design-Build Projects: DBMG’s unique ability to offer design-build services, a full range of steel construction services and project management capabilities makes it a preferred partner for complex, design-build fabrication projects in the geographic regions it serves. This capability often enables DBMG to bid against fewer competitors in a less traditional, more negotiated selection process on these kinds of projects, thereby offering the potential for higher margins while providing overall cost savings and project flexibility and efficiencies to its customers;
•Expand and Diversify Revenue Base: DBMG is seeking to expand and diversify its revenue base by leveraging its long-term relationships with national and multi-national construction and engineering firms, national and regional accounts, original equipment manufacturers, industrial owners, and other customers. DBMG also intends to continue to grow its operations by targeting projects that carry higher margins and less risk of large margin fluctuations. DBMG believes that continuing to diversify its revenue base by completing projects - such as low-rise office buildings, healthcare facilities and other commercial and industrial structures - could reduce the impact of periodic adverse market or economic conditions, as well as the margin slippage that may accompany larger projects;
•Emphasize Innovative Services: DBMG focuses its BIM modeling, digital engineering, design-build, engineering, detailing, fabrication, erection, and construction expertise on larger, more complex projects, where it typically experiences less competition and more advantageous negotiated contract opportunities. DBMG has extensive experience in providing services requiring complex BIM modeling, detailing, fabrication and erection techniques and other unusual project needs, such as BIM coordination, specialized transportation, steel treatment or specialty coating applications, piping, machinery rigging and setting, deep foundations, and specialty welding. These service capabilities have enabled DBMG to address such design-sensitive projects as stadiums, uniquely designed hotels and casinos, pulp and paper mills, chemical plants, and other industrial and manufacturing facilities;
•Diversify Customer and Product Base: Although DBMG seeks to achieve a leading share of the geographic and product markets in which it traditionally competes, it also seeks to diversify its product offerings and geographic markets through acquisition. By expanding the portfolio of products offered and geographic markets served, DBMG believes that it will be able to offer more value-added services to existing and new potential customers, as well as to reduce the impact of periodic adverse market or economic conditions; and
•Ensure Project Delivery Success through Predictive Technologies: DBMG uses resources including data analytics, modeling and detailing, laser scan to BIM, and augmented and virtual reality to provide fully integrated solutions for a project’s lifecycle from design through to fabrication and construction, as well as providing mechanical and facility services. DBMG is thus able to deliver optimal value and reliable outcomes that are on schedule and on budget across a wide variety of services and geographic regions. 
Services and Customers
DBMG consists of five business units spread across diverse markets: Schuff Steel Company ("SSC") (steel fabrication and erection), Banker Steel (steel fabrication and erection), DBM Vircon (steel detailing, rebar detailing, bridge detailing, BIM modeling services and BIM management services), the Aitken product line (manufacturing of equipment for the oil and gas industry), and GrayWolf (steel fabrication and erection, specialty facility maintenance, repair, and installation services, as well as management of smaller structural steel projects, leveraging subcontractors). For the year ended December 31, 2022, revenues were as follows (in millions):

Total | $ | 1,594.3 | | | 100.0 | %

The majority of DBMG's business is in North America, but DBM Vircon provides detailing services on five continents, and SSC provides fabricated steel to Canada and other select countries. In 2022, DBMG's two largest customers represented approximately 28.7% of revenues. In 2021, DBMG’s two largest customers represented approximately 23.4% of revenues.
DBMG’s size gives it the production capacity to complete large-scale, demanding projects, with typical utilization per facility ranging from 90% - 96% and a sales pipeline that includes over $4.6 billion in potential revenue generation. DBMG believes it has benefited from being one of the largest players in a market that is highly fragmented across many small firms.
DBMG achieves a highly efficient and cost-effective construction process by focusing on collaborating with all project participants and utilizing its extensive digital engineering, design-build and design-assist capabilities with its clients. Additionally, DBMG has in-house fabrication, erection, and multi-discipline industrial construction capabilities combined with access to a network of subcontractors for smaller projects in order to provide high-quality solutions for its customers. DBMG offers a range of services across a broad geography through its fifteen fabrication shops in the United States and thirty-six sales and management facilities located in the United States, Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand and the UK.
DBMG operates with minimal bonding requirements, with a current balance of 53.7% of DBMG's backlog (out of a total backlog of $1,782.3 million) as of December 31, 2022, and bonding is reduced as projects are billed rather than upon completion. DBMG has limited its raw material cost exposure by securing fixed prices from mills at contract bid as well as by utilizing its purchasing power as one of the largest domestic buyers of wide flange beams in the United States.

Suppliers
DBMG currently purchases its steel from a variety of domestic and foreign steel producers but is not dependent on any one producer. During the year ended December 31, 2022, DBMG, through SSC and Banker Steel, purchased approximately 60% of the total value of steel and steel components purchased from two domestic steel vendors. Refer to Item 1A - Risk Factors - "Risks Related to the Infrastructure segment" elsewhere in this document for discussion on DBMG’s reliance on suppliers of steel and steel components. 
Sales and Distributions
DBMG obtains contracts through competitive bidding or negotiation, which generally are fixed-price, cost-plus, unit cost, or time and material arrangements. Bidding and negotiations require DBMG to estimate the costs of the project up front, with most projects typically lasting from one to twelve months. However, large and more complex projects can often last two years or more.
Marketing
General managers along with sales managers lead DBMG’s sales and marketing efforts. Each general manager is primarily responsible for sales, estimating, and marketing efforts in defined geographic areas. In addition, DBMG employs full-time project estimators and chief estimators. DBMG’s sales representatives build and maintain relationships with general contractors, architects, engineers, OEMs, industrial owners, and other potential sources of business to identify potential new projects. DBMG generates future project reports to track the weekly progress of new opportunities. DBMG’s sales efforts are further supported by most of its executive officers, engineering, and strategic sales and marketing personnel, who have substantial experience in the design, detailing, modeling, fabrication, industrial construction, maintenance, and erection of structural steel and heavy steel plate.
DBMG competes for new project opportunities through its relationships and interaction with its active and prospective customer base which provides valuable current market information and sales opportunities. In addition, DBMG is often contacted by governmental agencies in connection with public construction projects, and by large private-sector project owners, general contractors and engineering firms in connection with new building projects such as manufacturing and industrial plants, data centers, warehouse and distribution centers, and other industrial and commercial facilities.
Upon selection of projects to bid or price, DBMG’s estimating departments review and prepare projected costs of shop, field, detail drawing preparation and crane hours, steel and other raw materials, and other costs. With respect to bid projects, a formal bid is prepared detailing the specific services and materials DBMG plans to provide, along with payment terms and project completion timelines. Upon acceptance, DBMG’s bid proposal is finalized in a definitive contract.
Competition
The principal geographic and product markets DBMG serves are highly competitive, and this intense competition is expected to continue. DBMG competes with other contractors for commercial, industrial and specialty projects on a local, regional, or national basis. Continued service within these markets requires substantial resources and capital investment in equipment, technology and skilled personnel, and certain of DBMG’s competitors have financial and operating resources greater than DBMG. Competition also places downward pressure on DBMG’s contract prices and margins. The principal competitive factors within the industry are price, timeliness of project completion, quality, reputation, and the desire of customers to utilize specific contractors with whom they have favorable relationships and prior experience. While DBMG believes that it maintains a competitive advantage with respect to many of these factors, failure to continue to do so or to meet other competitive challenges could have a material adverse effect on DBMG’s results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2022, DBMG employed 3,489 full-time and 186 part-time people across the globe, including the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, the Philippines, Thailand, and the UK. The number of persons DBMG employs on an hourly basis fluctuates directly in relation to the amount of business DBMG performs. Certain of the fabrication and erection personnel DBMG employs are represented by various trade unions. DBMG is a party to several separate collective bargaining agreements with these unions in certain of its current operating regions, which expire (if not renewed) at various times in the future. Approximately 22% of DBMG’s employees are covered under various collective bargaining agreements. As of December 31, 2022, most of DBMG’s collective bargaining agreements are subject to automatic annual or other renewal unless either party elects to terminate the agreement on the scheduled expiration date. DBMG considers its relationship with its employees to be satisfactory and, other than sporadic and unauthorized work stoppages of an immaterial nature, none of which have been related to its own labor relations, DBMG has not experienced a work stoppage or other labor disturbance.
DBMG strategically utilizes third-party fabrication and erection subcontractors on many of its projects and also subcontracts detailing services from time to time when its management determines that this would be economically beneficial (and/or when DBMG requires additional capacity for such services). DBMG’s inability to engage fabrication, erection and detailing subcontractors on favorable terms could limit its ability to complete projects in a timely manner or compete for new projects, which could have a material adverse effect on its operations.
Legal, Environmental and Insurance
DBMG is subject to claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Such matters are inherently uncertain, and there can be no guarantee that the outcome of any such matter will be decided favorably to DBMG or that the resolution of any such matter will not have a material adverse effect upon DBMG or the Company’s business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Neither DBMG nor the Company believes that any of such pending claims and legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its (or the Company’s) business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
DBMG’s operations and properties are affected by numerous federal, state and local environmental protection laws and regulations, such as those governing discharges to air and water and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. These laws and regulations have become increasingly stringent and compliance with these laws and regulations has become increasingly complex and costly. There can be no assurance that such laws and regulations or their interpretation will not change in a manner that could materially and adversely affect DBMG’s operations. Certain environmental laws, such as CERCLA (the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act) and its state law counterparts, provide for strict and joint and several liability for investigation and remediation of spills and other releases of toxic and hazardous substances. These laws may apply to conditions at properties currently or formerly owned or operated by an entity or its predecessors, as well as to conditions at properties at which wastes or other contamination attributable to an entity or its predecessors come to be located. Although DBMG has not incurred any material environmental related liability in the past and believes that it is in material compliance with environmental laws, there can be no assurance that DBMG, or entities for which it may be responsible, will not incur such liability in connection with the investigation and remediation of facilities it currently operates (or formerly owned or operated) or other locations in a manner that could materially and adversely affect its operations.
DBMG maintains commercial general liability insurance in the amount of $2.0 million per occurrence and $4.0 million in the aggregate. In addition, DBMG maintains umbrella coverage limits of $75.0 million. DBMG also maintains insurance against property damage caused by fire, flood, explosion and similar catastrophic events that may result in physical damage or destruction of its facilities and property. DBMG maintains professional liability insurance in the amount of $10.0 million for professional services related to our work in steel erection and fabrication projects. 
All policies are subject to various deductibles and coverage limitations. Although DBMG’s management believes that its insurance is adequate for its present needs, there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain adequate insurance at premium rates that management considers commercially reasonable, nor can there be any assurance that such coverage will be adequate to cover all claims that may arise.
Life Sciences Segment (Pansend Life Sciences, LLC)
Our Life Sciences segment is comprised of Pansend Life Sciences, LLC ("Pansend"). Pansend maintains controlling interests of approximately 80.0% in Genovel Orthopedics, Inc.

R2 Technologies, Inc.
R2 develops and commercializes breakthrough aesthetic medical and non-medical devices in the aesthetic dermatology market. Founded in 2014 by Pansend and Blossom Innovations, LLC, R2 exclusively licenses intellectual property developed at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. 
Skin lightening and brightening is a large and fast-growing segment of aesthetic dermatology. Current lightening products and/or procedures may be ineffective, unpredictable or even harmful, and patients often must compensate for lack of efficacy by using makeup or concealers. R2 has developed breakthrough CryoAesthetic technologies that uniquely deliver treatments that provide patients skin lightening, brightening, skin tone evening and reduction or elimination of hyperpigmentation and inflammation. R2’s patented CryoModulation technology uses controlled cooling to suppress melanin, inflammation and discomfort by precisely controlling time and temperature to deliver an effective treatment with little social downtime.
In 2019, R2 closed on its Series B Preferred Stock financing round with its strategic partner, Huadong Medicine Company, Ltd., (“Huadong”). In connection with a staggered $30 million investment by Huadong, R2 entered into a distribution agreement with Huadong under which R2 granted Huadong all of R2's products in the Asia-Pacific region, and R2 is entitled to receive a share of Huadong's profits from such sales. As of December 31, 2022, R2 has received the entire $30 million investment from Huadong.
In 2021, Pansend invested $15 million in R2's Series C Preferred Stock at a post-money valuation of $150 million for R2. 
R2 currently has three products in various stages of commercialization and development:
1.Glacial Rx – Launched in the first quarter of 2021 in the United States after receiving U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) clearance for use in dermatologic procedures for the removal of benign lesions of the skin and for use when cooling is intended for the temporary reduction of pain, swelling, inflammation, and hematoma from minor surgical procedures. When used with R2 Dermabrasion Tips, the intended use includes general dermabrasion, scar revision, acne scar revision and tattoo removal. The Glacial Rx system effectively and comfortably addresses these conditions, leaving the skin with a smoother and brighter appearance with little downtime for the patient. The Glacial Rx system is sold to dermatologists and plastic surgeons and operated by trained healthcare professionals.
2.Glacial Spa – Launched in the first half of 2022 in China after receiving China Non-Medical Classification, the Glacial Spa is a cooling experience used to even skin tone, and brighten and lighten skin. The Glacial Spa system will be sold by Huadong’s existing sales force to spas and is intended to be operated by a trained aesthetician.
3.Glacial AI – Currently undergoing research and development, the Glacial AI is an autonomous, robotic cooling device focused on whole-body skin lightening and brightening.
Sales and Distribution
In North America, R2 utilizes a direct sales force to sell Glacial Rx. As of December 31, 2022, R2 had a North American sales force of 20 employees, and total full-time employees of 46 and part-time employees of 9.
In international markets, R2 sells both Glacial Rx and Glacial Spa through distributors. 
Competition
The medical technology and aesthetic product markets are highly competitive and dynamic and are characterized by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovations. Demand for our products could be limited by the products and technologies offered now or in the future by our competitors. 
Due to less stringent regulatory requirements, there are many more aesthetic products and procedures available for use in international markets than are cleared for use in the United States. There are also fewer limitations on the claims our competitors in international markets can make about the effectiveness of their products and the manner in which they can market them. As a result, we face more competition in these markets than in the United States.
We also compete against medical technology and aesthetic companies, including those offering products and technologies unrelated to skin lightening and brightening, for physician resources and mind share. Some of our competitors have a broad range of product offerings, large direct sales forces, and long-term customer relationships, which could inhibit our market penetration efforts. Our potential customers also may need to recoup the cost of expensive products that they have already purchased from our competitors, and thus they may decide to delay or not to purchase our products.
We believe that our products compete favorably, largely based on the following competitive factors:
•Our products safely downregulate inflammation and pain, accelerate exfoliation and normalize melanin production. This is a breakthrough technology unlike any other currently available in the marketplace;
•Our products are versatile, providing customized treatment capabilities for patients of all ages and skin types making every aesthetic patient a candidate;
•Our products achieve measurable results with little to no patient discomfort and high patient satisfaction;
•Glacial Rx is FDA cleared in the United States as a complementary treatment to improve the patient experience of most other pain or inflammation inducing treatments. This allows practices to offer a highly differentiated experience to existing customers and attract new business, generating additional revenue.
Governmental Approvals
The design, development, manufacture, testing and sale of our Glacial Rx product is subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities, principally the FDA, and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies.
The Glacial Rx product (also known as the Dermal Cooling System) originally received 510(k) clearance in October 2016 as a cryosurgical instrument intended for use in dermatologic procedures for the removal of benign lesions of the skin. In July 2017, the FDA cleared device modifications implemented to improve usability of the Dermal Cooling System. Subsequently in September 2020, we received FDA clearance for expansion of the Dermal Cooling System indication to include use when cooling is intended for the temporary reduction of pain, swelling, inflammation, and hematoma from minor surgical procedures. In August 2021, the Dermal Cooling System was also cleared by the FDA for use with optional dermabrasion tip accessories for general dermabrasion, scar revision, acne scar revision, and tattoo removal. Most recently, in November 2022, FDA clearance was received for expansion of the Dermal Cooling System indication to include minimize pain, inflammation, and thermal injury during laser and dermatological treatments and for temporary topical anesthetic relief of injections.
We have received regulatory approval or are otherwise free to market the Glacial Rx product in numerous international markets. Any devices we manufacture or distribute pursuant to clearance or approval by the FDA are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies, including establishment registration and device listing with the FDA. We are required to adhere to applicable regulations detailed in FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMP") as set forth in the Quality System Regulation, which include among other things, testing, control and documentation requirements. Non-compliance with these standards can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to grant 510(k) clearance of devices, withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecutions. We and our contract manufacturer have designed and operate our manufacturing facilities under the FDA's cGMP requirements and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with regulatory requirements. 
Because we are a manufacturer of medical devices, we must also comply with medical device reporting requirements by reviewing and reporting to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that one of our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury. We must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. Labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. Medical devices approved or cleared by the FDA may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses, otherwise known as “off-label” promotion. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution.
The regulatory review process for medical devices varies from country to country, and many countries also impose product standards, packaging requirements, environmental requirements, labeling requirements and import restrictions on devices. Each country has its own tariff regulations, duties, and tax requirements. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements may subject a company to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, criminal prosecution, or other consequences.
The California Food & Drug Branch inspected our San Ramon facility in December 2016 and had no findings or observations. In international markets, we are required to obtain and maintain various quality assurance and quality management certifications. We have obtained the following international certifications: EN ISO 13485:2016 Medical Devices - Quality Management Systems - Requirements for regulatory purposes and Medical Device Single Audit Program (US and Canada). In November 2022, we were audited by our Certification Body, SGS, and all certifications have been extended to cover our Dublin facility.
Sources of Raw Materials and Suppliers
We depend upon our contract manufacturer to build our products. We rely on purchase orders rather than long-term contracts with our contract manufacturer, which mitigates some risks, including price increases. However, this subjects us to other risks such as component shortages. We continue to evaluate alternative sources of supply for these components and materials.
Patents and Proprietary Technology
To establish and protect our proprietary technologies and products, we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade-secret laws, as well as confidentiality provisions in our contracts. We have implemented a patent strategy designed to protect our technology and facilitate commercialization of our current and future products. As of December 31, 2022, our patent portfolio comprised 45 issued patents and 113 pending patent applications, each of which we either own directly or for which we are the exclusive licensee. Our intellectual property portfolio for our CryoModulation technology was built through the combination of licensing patents from third parties and the issuance of new patents to us as the result of our ongoing development activities. Many of our issued and pending patents were exclusively licensed from General Hospital Corporation, which owns and operates the Massachusetts General Hospital ("MGH") and generally relate to our core technology. In general, patents have a term of 20 years from the application filing date or earliest claimed priority date. We expect our issued and exclusively licensed patents to expire in 2037 or later.
We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how, contractual arrangements, and continuing innovation to protect our intellectual property and maintain our competitive position. We have a policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with third parties, employees, and consultants. We also have a policy that our employees and consultants sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their interests in intellectual property such as patents and copyrights arising from their work for us.
Patent License Agreement
On December 8, 2014, the Company entered into a Patent License Agreement with MGH, whereby R2 may use certain licensor assets and patent rights for the commercial development, manufacturing, distribution and use in products and processes. The agreement, as amended, calls for royalties to be paid at 8% of net sales of all products and processes with minimum guarantees. Future annual minimum royalty payment commitments are as follows: $75,000 on the first anniversary, $100,000 on the second anniversary, $150,000 on the third anniversary, and $200,000 on the fourth anniversary of the effective date that occurs following the first commercial sale, and each subsequent anniversary of the effective date thereafter through the term. In addition, R2 will pay a milestone payment of $1,000,000 within sixty days of the earliest: (i) first commercial sale, (ii) first regulatory approval allowing Sale or marketing of a product or process in any country, (iii) the first marketing of a product or process in any country. 
As of December 31, 2022, we have completed all milestones associated with the license agreement with MGH and have made all required license fee and milestone payments to MGH described above. We continue to pay the royalty on net sales as required by the agreement and currently have no additional obligations to MGH resulting from any sublicensing agreement.
MediBeacon, Inc.
MediBeacon is developing a proprietary non-invasive real-time monitoring system for the evaluation of kidney function. Current methods to evaluate kidney function are indirect estimates that may be inaccurate and are not real-time. Chronic kidney disease is estimated to affect more than 850 million people worldwide.
MediBeacon’s Transdermal GFR Measurement System (“TGFR”), which uses an optical skin sensor combined with Lumitrace, a proprietary agent that glows in the presence of light, will be the first non-invasive system to enable real-time, direct monitoring of kidney function at point-of-care. On October 22, 2018, the FDA granted Breakthrough Device designation to the TGFR for the measurement of Glomerular Filtration Rate (“GFR”) in patients with impaired or normal kidney function. Under the Breakthrough Device program, the FDA works with companies to expedite regulatory review in order to give patients more timely access to innovative diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. MediBeacon began its U.S. pivotal study in the second half of 2022 and is expected to submit results of the study to the FDA in the first half of 2023.
In 2019, MediBeacon closed its Series B financing round with its strategic partner, Huadong. In connection with a $30 million staggered investment by Huadong, MediBeacon entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Huadong, under which MediBeacon granted Huadong the exclusive rights to distribute all of MediBeacon’s products in Greater China and MediBeacon will receive royalty payments on net sales of the TGFR system. Under this agreement, Huadong is also responsible for funding clinical trials, commercial and regulatory activities relating to the TGFR system in 25 countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including Greater China. MediBeacon received the first $15 million tranche during 2019 at a pre-money valuation of approximately $300 million. In 2020, Huadong amended their agreements to provide for Huadong to prepay $20 million of future China royalties to fund registration of the TGFR system as a Class 1 device in China, allowing it to immediately enter the Chinese hospital system. As of December 31, 2022, the full $20 million has been received.
On November 16, 2022, MediBeacon and Huadong amended their existing agreements to provide that Huadong will invest approximately $10 million in funding in MediBeacon by June 30, 2023, including $7.5 million or 50% of the remaining $15 million milestone investment due upon FDA approval of MediBeacon's TGFR, at a pre-money valuation of approximately $400 million.
MediBeacon is also exploring additional clinical applications of the patented Lumitrace technology, including: 
1.Gastrointestinal permeability, which has the potential to transform management of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including Crohn’s disease. Grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, in collaboration with scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and the Mayo Clinic, have supported MediBeacon’s research in this area. The first in-human clinical studies were recently completed to study the feasibility of fluorescent tracer agent-based systems to quantify the permeability of the gastrointestinal tract in patients with active Crohn’s disease.
2.Ocular angiography, which has the potential to diagnose and monitor vasculature leakage in the eye, a key factor in diagnosing and monitoring various diseases, including macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and retinal vasculitis while avoiding current potential clinical side effects such as allergic reactions, nausea and vomiting. MediBeacon was the recipient of a Small Business Innovation Research grant supported by the National Eye Institute of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). With this support, MediBeacon is pursuing research into the use of a MediBeacon fluorescent tracer agent to visualize vasculature in the eye with clinical studies currently underway.
3.Surgical visualization feasibility, which has the potential to be used in open, laparoscopic and robotic surgeries to identify critical structures, tumor margins and blood flow in tissues in real-time. Clinical research in this area is still underway.

Spectrum Segment (HC2 Broadcasting Holdings Inc.)
HC2 Broadcasting Holdings Inc., ("HC2B" and together with its subsidiaries, "Broadcasting"), a majority-owned subsidiary of INNOVATE, is an owner and operator of broadcast TV stations throughout the U.S. and an avenue for high-end content providers to deliver their product OTA to more homes and, ultimately, mobile devices. Broadcasting’s stations are interconnected to an internet protocol network backbone, which allows Broadcasting to monitor and operate the stations remotely, resulting in significant cost efficiencies.
As of December 31, 2022, Broadcasting operated 251 stations, including 3 Full-Power stations, 53 Class A stations and 195 LPTV stations. Broadcasting stations are collectively able to broadcast over 1,500 sub-channels and reach 106 markets in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including 32 of the top 35 markets. Broadcasting has approximately 95 stations concentrated in the top 35 markets.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, Broadcasting included Azteca America. Azteca America aired Spanish language programming targeting U.S. Hispanics. The majority of the network’s programming was provided by TV Azteca, S.A.B. de C.V. ("TV Azteca"), Mexico’s second largest broadcast network, under a multi-year Programming Licensing Agreement ("PLA"). Broadcasting had employees in the U.S. and contracted employees in Mexico under a Broadcast Services Agreement ("BSA") with TV Azteca dedicated to the operations of Azteca America. On December 31, 2022, Broadcasting shutdown the operations and broadcasting of the Azteca America network and, during the year ended December 31, 2022, terminated both the PLA and BSA with TV Azteca. New network content is now in place on those stations formerly carrying Azteca.

(a) Rankings are based on the relative size of a station’s Designated Market Area ("DMA") among the 210 generally recognized DMAs in the United States.
Broadcast Operations
Broadcasting carries approximately 70 networks on its stations, distributing content across the U.S. Broadcasting provides free OTA programming to television viewing audiences in the communities it serves. The programming Broadcasting distributes includes networks targeting shopping, weather, sports and entertainment programming, as well as religious networks and networks targeting select ethnic groups.
Revenues 
Broadcasting generates broadcast station revenue and network advertising revenue from its operations. Broadcast station revenue is generated primarily from the sale of television airtime in return for a fixed fee or a portion of the related ad sales. In a typical broadcast station revenue agreement, the owner of a station makes available, for a fee, airtime on a station subchannel to a third party. The third party broadcasts during that airtime and collects revenue from advertising aired during such content. Broadcast station revenue is recognized over the life of the contract. The fees charged can be fixed or variable and the contracts that the Company enters into are generally short-term in nature. Variable fees are usage/sales-based and are recognized as revenue when the subsequent usage occurs. 
Network advertising revenue is generated primarily from the sale of television airtime for advertisements or paid programming. Network advertising inventory is sold in the upfront and scatter markets and is offered at market rates, based on a number of factors such as available inventory, network programming and ratings, and economic conditions. In the upfront market, advertisers buy advertising time for the upcoming season. In the scatter market, advertisers buy advertising time close to when the commercials will be run and varies quarter over quarter. In some cases, the network advertising sales are subject to impressions guarantees that require the Broadcasting to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved. Network advertising revenue is recognized when advertising spots are aired, and as impression guarantees, if any, are achieved. Impressions are defined as the number of times that an advertisement is viewed by users. The achievement of performance guarantees is based on audience viewership from an independent research company. If there is a guarantee to deliver a targeted audience number of impressions, revenues are recognized based on the proportion of the audience impressions delivered to the total guaranteed in the contract. 
For the local inventory, Broadcasting sells national spot advertising and local advertising. National spot advertising represents time sold to advertisers that advertise in more than one DMA. Local advertising revenue is generated from local merchants and service providers. National and local advertising spots are generally sold without guaranteed ratings, and revenue is recognized when spots are aired.
Network distribution revenue consists of fees charged and payments received from cable, satellite and other multiple video program distribution (“MVPD”) systems for their retransmission of our network content. Broadcasting’s network is aired on MVPDs pursuant to multi-year carriage agreements that provide for the level of carriage that the Company’s network will receive. Carriage of the network is generally determined by package, such as whether the network is included in the more widely distributed, general entertainment packages offered or lesser-distributed, specialized packages, such as U.S. Hispanic-targeted or Spanish language package. Network distribution revenue is determined on the contractual rate-per-subscriber negotiated in the agreements, the average number of subscribers that receive content, and the market demand for the content that Broadcasting provides. Network distribution fees received from MVPDs are recognized as revenue in the period that services are provided. 
With the shut-down of the Azteca America network on December 31, 2022, Broadcast revenues will be driven principally by channel leases and revenue share agreements with some 70 other networks carried on Broadcasting's stations.
Strategy
Broadcasting’s strategy includes the following initiatives:
•Broadcasting is principally designed to be a nationwide OTA distribution platform, targeting the growing number of OTA households in the U.S.;
•Broadcasting's vision is to capitalize on the opportunities to bring valuable content to more viewers over-the-air and to position itself for the changing media landscape and to take advantage of the technology advances rapidly underway in the industry; 
•As of December 31, 2022, 245 operating stations are connected to Broadcasting's cloud-based IP backbone and can be operated and monitored remotely, allowing for substantial cost savings and operating efficiencies. In 2018, FCC deregulation in TV broadcasting eliminated the need for full time employees and studio facilities in markets where Broadcasting operates Full-Power and Class A stations, thus allowing Broadcasting to operate these stations remotely at greater cost efficiency;
•Broadcasting's major focus is to attract the highest quality content providers looking for nationwide distribution. With its national footprint and cloud-based infrastructure, Broadcasting also expects to realize premium pricing for content distribution; and,
•Broadcasting's growing revenue source is from providing national carriage to content providers. Carriage contracts pricing is in part determined by the signal contour of the broadcast station and the number of OTA TV households in a given market, as well as market supply and demand.
Competition
Our television stations compete in the U.S. domestic media market for multicast network tenants, viewer audiences and advertisers. In the last several years, there has been increasing competition from not just cable channels but also streaming services, digital platforms, social media, and internet-delivered video channels. These media platforms have taken market share from “over-the-air” (OTA) broadcast stations like ours. Full Power stations delivering OTA multicast networks also represent direct competition in all our markets. Because our stations are mostly LPTVs and Class A stations, our signal coverage of a market is often less than that of Full Power stations, resulting in a competitive advantage for Full Power stations. As a result of improvements in digital compression technology over the last several years, many Full Power stations have increased the number of subchannels that they can lease to OTA multicast networks, resulting in increased competition in many of our markets over the last several years.
Because nearly all our stations are LPTV and Class A, they do not have primary channel “must carry” rights and, therefore, have no signal coverage and carriage on multichannel video programming distributor ("MVPD") systems. Our lack of MVPD distribution materially affects our television stations’ competitive position in attracting programmers and viewers. Specifically, MVPD systems can increase a broadcasting station’s competition for viewers in a market by providing both cable networks and distant television station signals not otherwise available to the station’s audience. Other sources of competition for audiences, programming and advertisers include streaming services, connected televisions, internet websites, mobile applications and wireless carriers, direct-to-consumer video distribution systems, and home entertainment systems. Recent developments by many companies, including internet streaming service providers and internet website operators, have expanded, and are continuing to expand, the variety and quality of broadcast and non-broadcast video programming available to consumers via the internet. Internet companies have developed business relationships with companies that have traditionally provided syndicated programming, network television and other content. As a result, additional programming has, and is expected to further become, available through non-traditional methods, which can directly impact the number of OTA TV viewers, and, thus, indirectly impact station revenues.
Government Approvals and Regulation
Federal broadcasting industry regulations limit our operating flexibility. The FCC regulates all local television broadcasters, including us. We must obtain FCC approval whenever we (i) apply for a new license; (ii) seek to renew or modify a license; (iii) purchase or sell a broadcast station license; and/or (iv) assign or transfer the control of one of our subsidiaries that holds a license. Our FCC licenses are critical to our operations, and we cannot operate without them. Our FCC licenses must be renewed every 8 years. The current television license renewal cycle began in 2020, and many of our licenses have been renewed, but others remain pending. While we cannot be certain that the FCC will renew the remaining licenses or that we will always obtain renewal grants in the future, the FCC has historically renewed the Company’s broadcast licenses in substantially all cases. The Company does not believe that the expiration or non-renewal of any of our FCC licenses would have a material adverse effect on the expected future cash flows and profitability.
The FCC can sanction us for programming broadcast on our stations that it finds to be indecent. Over the past several years, the FCC has increased its enforcement efforts regarding broadcast indecency and profanity. Additionally, our Full-Power stations and Class A stations are subject to additional FCC rules regarding the airing of mandatory children’s programming and local content. While we have measures in place to remain compliant, shortfalls in required programming for Full-Power stations and Class A stations may result in financial penalties levied by the FCC or, in worst cases, the loss of license. 
Federal legislation and FCC rules have changed significantly in recent years and may continue to change. These changes may affect our ability to conduct our business in ways that we believe would be advantageous and may impact our operating results.
New Broadcast TV Technology: ATSC 3.0
In 2017, the FCC approved ATSC 3.0, next generation broadcast standards defining how television signals are broadcast and interpreted. ATSC 3.0 is an enhancement to previous broadcast standards, providing enhanced picture and audio quality, mobility, addressability, increased capacity, and IP connectivity. ATSC 3.0 will offer a platform to merge linear programming and non-TV data services alongside OTA and over-the-top ("OTT"). Among the many emerging opportunities will be hyper-local news, weather, and traffic; dynamic ad insertion; geographic and demographic targeted advertising; customizable content; better measurement and analytics; the ability to share data with devices connected to the Internet; flexibility to add streams as needed; an ultra-high definition picture quality with enhanced immersive audio; and connectivity to automobiles. In addition, ATSC 3.0 will provide new emergency capabilities including advanced alerting functions which can relay evacuation routes and device wake-up features. Many of these features will be available to mobile devices.
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, Broadcasting employed 18 full-time employees and 1 part-time employees across the U.S.

Environmental Regulation and Laws
Our operations and properties, including those of DBMG, are subject to a wide variety of increasingly complex and stringent foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those concerning emissions into the air, discharge into waterways, generation, storage, handling, treatment and disposal of waste materials and health and safety of employees. Sanctions for noncompliance may include revocation of permits, corrective action orders, administrative or civil penalties and criminal prosecution. Some environmental laws provide for strict, joint and several liability for remediation of spills and other releases of hazardous substances, as well as damage to natural resources. In addition, companies may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances. These laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others, or for our acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed.
Compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or relating to the protection of the environment has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Based on our experience to date, we do not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on our business or consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a result of future compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations or their interpretation, more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies, or stricter or different interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may require additional expenditures by us, which may be material. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant environmental compliance costs in the future.
