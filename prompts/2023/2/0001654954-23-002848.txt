General Development of Business

The Eastern Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Connecticut in October 1912, succeeding a co-partnership established in October 1858. The businesses of the Company design, manufacture and sell unique engineered solutions for industrial markets.

Today, the Company maintains 17 physical locations across North America, Europe, and Asia.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Argo supplies printed circuit boards and other electronic assemblies to original equipment manufacturers in various industries, including measurement systems, semiconductor equipment manufacturing, and industrial control, medical, and military products.

On November 3, 2021, the Company sold its Greenwald Industries division (“Greenwald”). Greenwald is an original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) offering a range of payment solutions from coin-vending products to smart card systems and payment applications.

In the second fiscal quarter of 2021 the Company determined that the companies included in its Diversified Products segment, including Argo, Greenwald, and Frazer & Jones, no longer fit with our long-term strategy and met the criteria to be treated as held for sale, and that the assets held for sale qualify for discontinued operations.

Human Capital 

We believe our success depends on the skills, experience, and industry knowledge of our key talent. As such, our management team places significant focus and attention on the attraction, development, and retention of employees, as well as ensuring our corporate culture reflects Eastern’s values, and our Board of Directors (our “Board”) provides oversight for various employee initiatives. Eastern values and our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics guide our actions, reflect our culture, and drive our performance. We have made and continue to make investments in training, and we have a well-established performance management process.

An engaged, innovative, skilled, and collaborative workforce is critical to our continued leadership in the design and manufacture of unique engineered solutions to industrial markets. We operate globally under policies and programs that provide competitive wages, benefits, and terms of employment. We are committed to efforts to increase diversity and foster an inclusive work environment that supports our global workforce through recruiting efforts and equitable compensation policies.

The health and safety of our employees is also a top priority. Our focus on the reduction of injuries and illnesses has significantly improved our safety performance. We have attained these improvements by fostering a global safety culture supported with regular training and education that includes robust systems and philosophies centered on personal responsibility and accountability. The Board established an Environment, Health and Safety Committee in 2019. There is a high level of leadership engagement, ensuring installation and maintenance of appropriate safety equipment at all our manufacturing sites worldwide combined with vigorous reviews of root causation and systemic corrective actions of any safety incidents that may occur.

In response to the emergence of COVID-19 in early 2020, we implemented a proactive internal procedure and complied with local, federal, and international governmental guidance that has enabled us to operate safely. 
Each of our facilities continues to adhere to such guidance as it has evolved, and we have also adjusted our remote worker safety procedures to ensure that remote employees are better integrated into our safety and health systems.

Employee levels are managed to align with business demand and management believes it currently has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully. As of December 31, 2022, we employed 1,191 full-time employees: 607 in the United States and 584 in other countries. Approximately 24% of employees in the United States are represented by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with employees, unions and works’ councils are in good standing. 

General

Patent and trademark protection for the various product lines of the Company is limited, but the Company believes the current patents and trademark protection is sufficient to protect the Company’s competitive positions. Patent durations are from 1 to 20 years. No business operation is dependent on any patent, nor would the loss of any patent have any material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

During the second fiscal quarter of 2021, the Company announced plans to sell the companies included in our Diversified Products segment, these assets met the criteria to be treated as held for sale and reported as discontinued operations. Subsequently, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company sold Greenwald and Frazer & Jones. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company sold Argo. 

The Company’s businesses are not subject to seasonal variations.

Customers of the Company are broad-based by geography and by market, and sales are not highly concentrated by customer. Only one customer exceeded 10% of accounts receivable for each of fiscal 2022 and 2021. Foreign sales were not significant for fiscal years 2022 and 2021. 

The Company encounters competition in its businesses. Imports from Asia and Latin America with favorable currency exchange rates and low-cost labor have created additional pricing pressure. The Company competes successfully by offering high-quality, custom engineered products on a timely basis. To compete, the Company deploys internal engineering resources, maintains cost effective manufacturing capabilities through its wholly owned Asian subsidiaries, expands its product lines through product development and acquisitions, and maintains sufficient inventory for fast turnaround of customer orders. 

The Company does not anticipate that compliance with federal, state, or local environmental laws or regulations is likely to have a material effect on the Company’s capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.

The Company obtains materials from nonaffiliated domestic sources, as well as from Company-affiliated and unaffiliated sources in Asia. Availability and prices of raw materials and outside services were affected by measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as by global trade restrictions, for some of the Company’s businesses during 2022. We expect raw materials and outside services to be more readily available in 2023 unless resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic occurs or trade restrictions continue, but prices may remain elevated or increase further.

The Company’s ratio of working capital (current assets less current liabilities) to sales was 26.1% in 2022 and 27.2% in 2021. Working capital includes cash held in various foreign subsidiaries. Other factors affecting working capital include our average days’ sales in accounts receivable, inventory turnover ratio and payment of vendor accounts payable. In some cases, the company must hold extra inventory due to extended lead time in receiving products ordered from our foreign subsidiaries to ensure product is available for our customers. The Company continues to monitor working capital needs with the goal of reducing our ratio of working capital to sales.
