Item 1. Business
Overview 
We are a cell and gene therapy company focused on the research, development, and commercialization of transformative treatments for cancer. We are led by an accomplished team with significant expertise and experience in this field, from discovery through clinical development to regulatory approval of Abecma (idecabtagene vicleucel, or ide-cel), the first chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, T cell therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for multiple myeloma. Our approach combines our expertise in T cell engineering technology and lentiviral vector gene delivery approaches, experience in research, development, and manufacturing of cell therapies and a suite of technologies that can be selectively deployed to develop highly innovative, targeted cellular therapies for patients with cancer. We are advancing multiple clinical programs, including SC-DARIC33, for the treatment of pediatric patients with relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, and bbT369, for the treatment of patients with B-cell non-Hodgkins lymphoma, or B-NHL, as well as multiple preclinical programs, including bbT4015, an engineered CAR T cell therapy targeting MUC16. Additionally, together with our partner Bristol Myers Squibb, or BMS, we are delivering Abecma to multiple myeloma patients in the United States following approval by the FDA of Abecma in March 2021 for the treatment of adults with multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior lines of therapy, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 (cyclic ADP ribose hydrolase) monoclonal antibody.
In recent years, growing understanding of cancer cell metabolism and genomics, as well as of the body’s immune response to tumor cells, has led to the development of new classes of therapies against cancer targets and pathways that have dramatically reshaped the treatment landscape. The advent of immunotherapy, particularly engineered cell therapies, has offered the potential to move past the treatment paradigm of maintenance of cancer as a “chronic” disease. Few curative therapies, however, exist and, in some settings, such as solid tumors, current approaches do not offer significant depth or durability of outcome for most cancer types and patients. Monotherapies have historically been of limited efficacy in cancer, and drugs are typically combined to deliver an outsized effect relative to the action of any of the individual components, with one potential advantage of combination therapies being the ability to address the heterogeneity of single target expression and/or mechanisms for relapse and resistance specific to a particular mechanism or target.
While medicines such as Abecma have highlighted the power of first-generation CAR T cell therapy by achieving previously unobtainable levels of efficacy in the late line setting, we believe that to be broadly successful in the treatment of cancer, a combination therapy approach is necessary, and that our multiplex approach to next-generation autologous cellular therapy, which allows multiple encoded mechanisms of action to be delivered within a single drug product, may be a potential solution. Based on our experience in the research and development of Abecma, we believe we can develop next-generation, engineered cell therapies to bring new options to patients suffering from a broad range of different tumor types.
In designing our next-generation product candidates, we aim to address the limitations of first-generation T cell therapies by augmenting them with additional technologies. These limitations include: (1) targeting a single tumor-associated antigen that may be lost or down regulated; (2) heterogeneous target expression resulting in the sparing of tumor cells devoid of antigen; (3) expression of immunosuppressive molecules such as transforming growth factor-β, or TGFβ, or programmed death ligand 1, or PD-L1, in the tumor microenvironment; and/or (4) poor T cell engraftment and persistence.
Our Approach
Our approach is to create product candidates that are multiplex engineered cell therapies by combining: (1) CAR and T cell receptor technology, which programs T cells to recognize and kill cancer cells based on the cell surface expression or presentation of intracellular protein targets, respectively; (2) dual-targeting CAR architecture for multi-target tumor cell recognition; (3) our core lentiviral gene transfer technology which delivers these genetic cargos (and more) to program a patient’s own T cells to the kill the cancer cells; (4) our megaTAL-based gene-editing technology which allows us to perform site specific gene addition or deletion from the genome to improve 

the properties of the T cell; and (5) genetically encoded technologies for engineering T cells to enhance the cytotoxic activity and reprogram the tumor microenvironment for more effective anti-tumor responses. This approach is differentiated by: (1) careful analysis of clinical and correlative data with the goal of precisely defining the key attributes of a cellular therapy necessary for anti-tumor effect; (2) the ability to design and then engineer a cell with these key attributes; combined with (3) a technology suite capable of delivering multiple innovations within a single drug product.
We believe this approach will allow us to address the challenges of achieving deep and durable clinical benefit to patients with cancers. We believe the ability of tumors to evade the immune system and to escape the action of a single drug intervention can be addressed by cellular therapies pre-armed with multi-layered strategies for tumor eradication and control. These multiplex cell therapies may have the potential to achieve a depth and durability of response, independent of the tumor type, that is not measured in weeks, but in months or years. We believe that our approach will allow us to improve how cell and gene therapies are discovered, developed, and manufactured, with the potential to transform the care of patients with cancer. For example, bbT369, our product candidate for B-NHL, uses multiple technologies in order to address the two main modes of failure observed with CD19-targeted T cell approaches: loss or diminution of antigen expression and reduction in T cell activation through loss or diminution of co-receptor signaling.
We believe that our past experience in the clinical setting also provides us with a unique advantage, given the relative nascency of the CAR T cell field and the consequent paucity of large data sets of autologous cellular therapies in cancer. We, including through our collaborators at BMS, have treated hundreds of patients with multiple myeloma in the clinical setting, and the clinical and correlative data sets from our collaboration with BMS provide us with a deep understanding of the biology of the tumor itself, its interplay with immune cells, and which cell therapy attributes may be key to patient response. We believe that understanding is critical to identifying the key barriers in the treatment of the cancer. Specifically, we believe that understanding the heterogeneity of target expression combined with any tumor-specific mechanisms of immune evasion at play can help define the components of a cellular therapy with the potential for maximal anti-tumor activity. This understanding will be key to our product candidate design and selection, manufacturing process design and execution, and clinical trial design and development strategy.
In designing our next-generation product candidates, we start with the concept of a tumor-redirected T cell (via CAR or engineered T cell receptor, or TCR, technology) and then add one or more additional features or components from the suite of proprietary technologies we have developed with the purpose of overcoming specific limitations of first-generation T cell therapies. For example, these additional technologies may address: 
•Tumor targets with off-tumor expression, through the application of our regulatable CAR T technology, dimerizing agent–regulated immunoreceptor complex, or DARIC; 
•Immunosuppressive molecules in the tumor microenvironment, through the application of our chimeric TGFβ flip receptor, or CTBR, technology which turns a suppressive signal into a T cell supportive interleukin receptor signal;
•Antigen loss or down-regulation resulting in escape, through application of our dual-targeting CAR T cell technology; or
•Incomplete T cell activation or proliferation resulting in a loss of T cell potency, through the implementation of synergistic co-stimulatory pathways and the application of our gene-editing technology to knock-out intracellular checkpoints.
Our clinical programs in B-NHL and AML are illustrations of our multiplex approach, applied to address the specific challenges of treating those cancers:
We are developing our bbT369 product candidate as a potential treatment for patients with B-NHL. The advent of the first generation of anti-CD19 CAR T products represents a significant advancement in the field of B-NHL and has established a new standard for the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory B-NHL. However, more than half of patients treated with an anti-CD19 CAR T do not achieve durable remission. Prognosis remains poor for 

these patients, with median overall survival after axicabtagene ciloleucel, or axi-cel, of approximately six months for patients initially responding and less than two months for patients without initial response. The main limitations of the first-generation CAR T therapies are the lack of complete response in some patients and the potential for late relapse, indicating a need for deeper and more durable treatment responses. We take a differentiated approach from the approved anti-CD19 CAR T therapies: we have designed a dual-targeting CAR to target CD20 and CD79a to limit antigen escape (as has been seen with CD19-targeted therapies). We provide split co-stimulation to drive maximal activation of the T cell in response to antigens. We include a gene edit designed to drive increased expansion, resist anergy, and maintain potency in sub-optimal conditions for T cell activation. Clinical study CRC-403, an open-label, multi-site Phase 1/2 dose-escalation study of bbT369, will serve as a potential proof-of-concept assessment of our proprietary gene editing platform, dual-targeting strategies and split co-stimulation signaling technology. Dosing in the first cohort of CRC-403 was completed in 2022, and the trial is currently enrolling patients at the second dose level. 
We are developing our SC-DARIC33 product candidate as a potential treatment for pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed or refractory AML. Although CAR T therapy has shown transformative potential and durable efficacy in other hematologic tumors, the use of CAR T therapy in the treatment of AML has been complicated by the expression of key targets such as CD33 across healthy myeloid cells in addition to leukemic blasts and stem cells. In other words, a highly potent CAR T cell directed towards one of these targets carries the significant risk of “on-target, off-tumor” toxicity because of broad myeloid aplasia. In developing SC-DARIC33 as a potential treatment for patients with AML, we seek to address the challenge of balancing potency and safety risk by combining advanced CAR T receptor technology with our DARIC technology, a pharmacologically controlled “on-off” switch to reversibly regulate the activity of the CAR T cell. We have designed the CAR to target both full-length and alternatively spliced CD33 variants to address heterogeneity in the disease, and to reduce the risk of antigen escape and disease relapse. We believe that the DARIC switch will give treating physicians the ability to turn off highly potent CAR T cell activity to allow for myeloid recovery, while being able to re-activate CAR T cell activity on demand. PLAT-08, the investigator-initiated proof-of-concept Phase 1 clinical trial of our SC-DARIC33 product candidate in pediatric and young adult relapsed or refractory AML patients, is led by our partner Seattle Children’s Therapeutics, a non-profit enterprise associated with Seattle Children’s Research Institute, or SCRI. The PLAT-08 trial is nearing completion of the mandatory adult dosing phase, and the totality of initial data to-date suggests SC-DARIC33 activation by rapamycin. The PLAT-08 trial will allow us to further assess our DARIC platform in light of the rapamycin-induced activation of SC-DARIC33 and potential for marrow recovery following rapamycin withdrawal. 
Our Strengths 
We believe that the capabilities and experience that our team has accrued provide us with an opportunity to capitalize on recent progress in the understanding of genetics, gene-editing, gene expression, tumor biology, immunology, process analytics, computational biology and data analytics to discover, develop and bring to the market next-generation cell and gene therapies for cancer:
•Extensive suite of gene modification technologies allows us to create multiplex product concepts: We have access to a broad range of technologies that we can leverage to design product candidates that aim to address the challenges of specific cancers. With internal capabilities to knock-in, knock-out, modify, and control expression of genes across multiple modalities with gene addition, gene-editing, cell engineering, and synthetic biology approaches, we have the ability to apply a combination of technologies to design potential multiplex next-generation cell and gene therapies for cancer. 
•Deep clinical experience and expertise with data science-driven iteration: From having treated hundreds of patients with multiple myeloma in CAR T programs through our collaboration with BMS, we have gained a deep understanding of cell therapy itself as well as an appreciation for the value of iterating on clinical data to inform our product candidate design, selection, manufacturing, clinical trial design and development strategy. Additionally, we employ data analytics in manufacturing to understand the critical product attributes of successful cellular products.

•Manufacturing experience and capability: Our team has accumulated significant experience in the manufacturing, analytical testing, and quality aspects from both lentiviral vectors and autologous lentiviral vector-transduced cellular drug products, from shepherding Abecma through clinical development, regulatory approval, and to commercialization in the United States, as well as from bluebird bio’s betibeglogene autotemcel in Europe. Moreover, we, in partnership with National Resilience Inc., or Resilience, have successfully scaled-up our suspension-based manufacturing process for lentiviral vector, or sLVV, which is being utilized in ongoing clinical trials for ide-cel. We recently added a Phase 1 cell therapy manufacturing facility in our Cambridge headquarters which we believe will enable us to improve the profile and accelerate timelines for the delivery of product candidates to patients. We anticipate the facility will be operational by mid-2023. We believe our experience spanning first-in-human to commercial manufacturing, quality control and quality assurance represents know-how critical to the efficient translation and development of our multiplex product candidates.
•Collaboration and connectivity: We have a strategic network of collaborations across industry, academic scientists, and medical experts to access technologies and expertise that supplement our proprietary technologies. We believe these collaborations and partnerships provide us with a rich suite of technologies permitting the design of impactful multiplex product candidates.

Our Strategy
Our strategy is to apply our broad range of technologies to design multiplex product candidates that address the key treatment challenges in cancer. Unlike other oncology-focused companies in our space, we believe our breadth of technology enables us to develop tailored products focused on the specific areas of cancer biology we have identified. We selectively combine the relevant features and components from our range of tools and technologies to address the defined attributes of a cellular therapy that we believe are necessary for anti-tumor effect. 
To execute on our strategy, we plan to:
•Co-commercialize Abecma, including clinical expansion to earlier lines of therapy, through our collaboration with BMS, and leverage our clinical and operational experience under this collaboration and this product revenue stream to further invest in our next-generation proprietary programs. 
•Leverage our leadership position in autologous CAR T therapies to advance through the clinic our next-generation programs in B-NHL, AML, and multiple myeloma. 

•Apply our multiplex approach to the discovery and design of transformative cell and gene therapy products for the treatment of solid tumors. 
•Seek to extend our approach to other cell types beyond T cells and to include off-the-shelf approaches, as we gain additional experience in our autologous T cell programs.
•Build upon our existing internal lentiviral vector manufacturing know-how and experience through both selective investments in manufacturing collaborations and through our internal capabilities, including the build-out of our drug product manufacturing capabilities at our Cambridge, Massachusetts headquarters. The facility, which we anticipate will be operational by mid-2023, is designed to enable rapid translational research in our clinical trials, as well as allow us to manufacture drug product for preclinical and Phase 1 clinical development activities, over time, with the objectives of enabling rapid iteration on clinical learnings into research and development, increasing the efficiency of manufacturing processes, and improving the overall patient and healthcare professional experience. 
Background
Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. It is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of cells that have the ability to evade recognition by the immune system’s surveillance. Cancer cells are abnormal cells that have developed mutations in essential cellular functions, driving increased cell division and growth as well as acquiring the ability to escape immune surveillance. In recent years, increased knowledge about cancer cell metabolism and genomics, as well as about the body’s immune response, has led to new classes of therapies against cancer targets and pathways that have dramatically reshaped the treatment landscape. Despite these advances, there remains a high unmet medical need for additional products and treatments, especially for patients with recurrent tumors or cancer types that are resistant to current therapeutic options. 
The advent of immunotherapy, and specifically engineered cell therapies, has offered the potential to move past the treatment paradigm of treatment of cancer as a “chronic” disease. By using engineered T cells, the first generation of engineered cell therapies directed the body’s natural immune response against cancer cells. Compelling efficacy data in cancers with historically bleak outcomes, with patients experiencing deep responses lasting for extended periods of time across multiple indications, showed the potential for engineered cell therapy to achieve a functional cure for some patients. However, there remain major tumor types that do not respond to current cell and gene therapy approaches, and, even within tumor types where cell and gene therapy has been broadly successful, many patients fail to receive an optimal outcome.
Challenges that remain in the discovery and development of engineered cell therapies for cancer reflect the difficulties in striking balance between efficacy and safety in these therapies. These challenges include:
•Selecting an appropriate target tumor antigen. If a potential cancer target antigen is also expressed or presented on normal tissues, the risk of on-target, off-tumor toxicity is increased. If an engineered T cell is designed to target a singular antigen, the risk of tumor escape mechanisms increases. Similarly, if the expression of the antigen is reduced or lost due to selective pressure or due to cellular internalization, the risk of tumor escape increases. If any of these occur, the safety and/or efficacy of the engineered cell therapy would be compromised.
•Engineering an optimal receptor. The properties of the receptor and receptor construct are critical for the overall success of the therapy. These properties include the affinity and flexibility of the antigen-binding domains (which are important for tumor-specific recognition), and the co-stimulatory domains for CAR T cell activation (which are important for the metabolism, function and persistence of T cells). 
•Complex manufacturing. The manufacture of individualized cell and gene therapies may be lengthy and complex. Patients typically wait approximately three weeks to two months to be treated with autologous engineered cells, and, in the meantime, such patients may experience complications or progressions from underlying disease without bridging therapies, which may introduce additional risk and toxicities for the patients, rendering them ineligible for treatment. In addition, the “process is the product” in the case of engineered cell therapies because of the complex nature of their manufacture, as compared to other 

common biologically derived modalities such as recombinant proteins and antibodies. Such therapies are inherently more complex to characterize and control, in part due to the variability of collected cells from the individual patients. Further, the process and analytical sciences to enable scale-up for commercial manufacturing are still significantly less advanced than that of proteins and antibodies, which limits access to patients.
Recent significant progress in the understanding of genetics, gene-editing, gene expression, tumor biology, immunology, process analytics and computational biology have converged to create an opportunity to markedly increase the breadth and depth of the potential impact of cell and gene therapies, and we believe that our capabilities provide us with an opportunity to capitalize on this opportunity to discover, develop and bring to the market next-generation cell and gene therapies for cancer. 
Our Technologies
Our oncology programs use a lentiviral vector to deliver the genetic cargo with the potential to program a patient’s own T cells to recognize specific proteins or protein fragments on the surface of cancer cells to kill the cancer cells. Our current programs are based on CAR technology designed to program T cells to recognize cancer cells based on expression of specific cell surface antigens, and T cell receptor technology designed to program T cells to recognize cancer cells based on protein fragments derived from either intracellular or extracellular proteins displayed on the tumor cell surface. The genetically engineered T cells are designed to supplement a patient’s immune system and we believe they have the potential to be further engineered to overcome immune evasion mechanisms employed by cancer cells. Our approach is to create multiplex engineered cell therapies by combining our foundational lentiviral vector and CAR/TCR technology with next-generation tools to address the challenges in existing cancer treatments. 
•Dual-Targeting. Polyclonal responses are a hallmark of adaptive immunity, but most T cell therapies have been devised with antigen receptors specific to a single target antigen. There are many documented cases of cancer deploying its intrinsic genetic plasticity to escape mono-targeted T cell therapies (both with cellular and more classical modalities, such as small molecules and antibodies). In such cases, our solution is to utilize a dual-targeting antigen receptor, including a multi-chain, dual-targeting architecture, to respond when either target antigen is present on a cancer cell, as well as an architecture that leverages the unique properties of humanized single-domain camelid-derived antibodies.
•DARIC. We have developed a dimerizing agent–regulated immunoreceptor complex, which we refer to as DARIC, that comprises separate antigen targeting and signal transduction componentry. DARIC receptors become poised for anti-tumor function only when the two components are brought together as heterodimers, a process that is strictly dependent on the bridging function of the drug rapamycin. This technology can enable pharmacological, “on-demand” control of engineered T cell responses. Controlling the “on” and “off” states of engineered T cells also creates opportunities to pursue cancers and cancer targets with disease characteristics and expression profiles that are incompatible with constitutively responsive antigen receptors.
•Reversal of immunosuppression. Patients who present in the clinic with advanced metastatic disease host tumors that have evolved to evade endogenous immunity via a variety of mechanisms. Tumor infiltrating T cells lose potency over time due to repetitive antigen stimulation and exhaustion in a tumor microenvironment that suppresses T cell function. Checkpoint engagement, hypoxia, poor nutrient conditions, and exposure to immunosuppressive cell types and cytokines all significantly blunt T cell potency and thwart attempts to regress tumors in clinically meaningful ways. We have developed a suite of synthetic biology innovations that antagonize and rewire immunosuppressive signaling and response pathways. We have focused significant attention on TGFβ, a profoundly immunosuppressive cytokine found at high levels in many solid tumors. Our chimeric TGFβ flip receptor, or CTBR, technology converts this suppressive signal into a supportive interleukin receptor signal that enhances T cell function. Suppressive to enhancing signal conversion operates in a localized, engineered T cell intrinsic manner, enhancing potency within the microenvironment of the tumor where the highest concentrations of activated 

TGFβ ligand are present. We have also developed several approaches to modulate T cell metabolism to allow for enhanced function and potency in the metabolically challenging tumor microenvironment. 
•Co-stimulation. Parallel track costimulatory domains, also known as chimeric costimulatory receptors, offer a unique set of functional attributes that culminate in enhanced anti-tumor activity. This technology pairs enhanced targeting breadth with a qualitatively distinct and more potent functional response, simultaneously countering two potential mechanisms of resistance.
•Gene-editing. megaTALs are highly specific, compact nucleases that efficiently catalyze the formation and mutagenic resolution of double-stranded breaks at pre-specified genetic target sequences. Using our megaTAL gene-editing platform, we have demonstrated that disrupting genes that intersect with T cell signaling and response pathways can promote more potent immune responses. In addition, we have developed a full suite of on-target editing assays, functional bioassays, and off-target discovery and verification analytics to deeply characterize gene-editing events and their functional consequences in target cells, which may enable the potential application of this technology in the clinical setting. 
•mRNA capabilities. We have also developed messenger RNA, or mRNA capabilities that enable transient gene expression, both in cells cultured ex vivo and for organ-specific in vivo delivery. We manufacture mRNA starting from a proprietary plasmid template outfitted with an encoded poly-A tract, an approach that results in highly homogenous mRNA species following in vitro transcription. Our purification process includes double-stranded RNA, or dsRNA depletion steps to minimize immunogenicity and optimize cell viability. A robust suite of analytical assays is in place to ensure that consistently pure and potent material is generated. We have developed clinical-scale electroporation processes for ex vivo mRNA delivery and are actively using these processes to improve T cell potency via our megaTAL gene-editing platform. This technology can potentially be further leveraged to transiently express other factors that may be advantageous to ex vivo manufactured T cells. 
In addition, we continue to invest in our core foundational technologies and build upon our leadership position in autologous engineered cell therapy products based on CAR and TCR approaches: 
•Next-generation lentiviral vector design. With a management team that collectively possesses decades of experience in this technology, we have extensively refined the componentry and methodology behind lentiviral vector design and manufacturing. Our transfer plasmid design elements include several innovations that have created advanced gene expression tuning capabilities and the delivery of large and complex genetic payloads via transgene stacking. We have developed proprietary codon optimization algorithms, promoter variants, and regulatory elements that we believe together enable constitutive and/or responsive expression profiles across a range of transgene expression levels. These mature capabilities enable highly efficient transfer of sophisticated genetic modules, such as the multiplex product concepts represented by our next-generation programs.
•Target selection and validation. Cancer targets with profiles that make them appropriate for cell therapy development have diverse structural features, biochemical properties, and sub-cellular distribution characteristics. To support novel target identification, we have developed significant in-house expertise and external collaborations in the areas of data mining, functional genomics, and primary tissue analysis. We have also built a full suite of target validation assays to perform confirmatory studies assessing tumor and normal tissue expression properties. In addition, we have developed significant internal expertise specifically aimed at de-risking potential off-target liabilities of TCR engineered T cells. We have focused the bulk of our efforts on select hematological and solid tumor indications. We believe this approach allows us to deeply interrogate the target landscape in cancers where T cell therapies may have the highest potential for technical success.
•Receptor engineering. We have access to state-of-the-art binder capabilities through our collaboration arrangements that cover the full range of potential cancer targets. For intracellular targets of interest, our partners develop TCRs and fully humanized “peptide-in-groove”, or PiG, single-chain variable fragment, or 

scFv, reagents. For surface proteins, we have multiple providers of immunization-sourced, fully humanized scFv and single-domain reagents. 
•Manufacturing process innovations. Our analytical development, clinical bioassays, correlative research, and data sciences teams have exceptional access to clinical trial data using CAR T therapies. We are regularly interrogating these data sets to isolate key manufacturing variables and correlates of clinical signals that enable hypothesis testing. These activities derive insights that inform process research directions for optimizing T cell manufacturing through reagents, processes, and culture timing, and for the discovery of underlying biological relationships between clinical and correlative data.
Our Programs
B-Cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma
We are developing our bbT369 product candidate as a treatment for patients with B-NHL, a heterogeneous group of neoplasms that can result in enlarged nodes across the body, neck, and abdomen, often coinciding with “B-symptoms” that are significant to the prognosis and staging of the disease, such as fever, drenching night sweats, and rapid and extreme weight loss. B-cell NHLs represent more than 85% of all NHL cases worldwide, and we plan to develop bbT369 to treat several subtypes of B-cell NHLs, specifically diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, high-grade B-cell lymphoma, or HGBCL, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, or PMBCL, follicular lymphoma, or FL, or transformed follicular lymphoma, or TFL. DLBCL is the most common form of NHL, accounting for a third of all NHL cases, with annual incidence in the United States estimated at approximately 25,000. DLBCL is a particularly aggressive form of NHL that requires immediate therapy upon diagnosis (with a median overall survival of less than one year in untreated patients).
CAR T cells targeting CD19 represent a significant advancement in the field of treatment for B-NHL and established a new standard of treatment for relapsed and refractory patients, with the potential for curative therapy. Specifically, anti-CD19 CAR T products axi-cel, tisagenlecleucel, and lisocabtagene maraleucel have been approved for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory large B-cell lymphoma (including DLBCL, HGBCL and TFL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy. However, survival for certain high-risk subtypes (e.g., non-germinal center B-cell-like subtype of lymphoma and double-hit lymphoma) and relapsed and refractory patients is poor. More than half of patients treated with CD19 CAR T do not achieve durable remission. Prognosis remains poor for these patients with median overall survival after axi-cel of approximately six months for patients initially responding and less than two months for patients without initial response. The main limitations of the currently available CAR T treatments are the lack of complete response in some patients, and the potential for late relapse, indicating a need for deeper and more durable treatment options.
Our multiplex approach is intended to enhance the depth and duration of response in patients currently underserved by existing options. bbT369 is a non-CD19-containing CAR T that addresses the limitations of the currently available therapies by using unique layered technologies, designed with the following key features: 
•A novel combination of CD20 and CD79a targets that are co-expressed in many B-NHL tumors to both allow treatment of CD19 negative / CD19 low tumors and to limit the potential for antigen escape;
•Split co-stimulation to drive optimal and complete immune signaling; and 
•A gene edit to drive increased expansion, resist anergy, and maintain potency in sub-optimal tumor conditions.
In preclinical models, bbT369 clears a variety of B-NHL tumors, including both dual and single target positive tumors, and outperforms CD19 in cells with varying levels of antigen expression. Additionally, the gene edit demonstrates increased cytokine production and expansion in vitro, and when compared to the same dual-targeted, but unedited, construct, bbT369 results in a lower rate of late tumor relapses.
Dosing in the first cohort of clinical study CRC-403, an open-label, multi-site Phase 1/2 dose-escalation study of bbT369 in relapsed and/or refractory B-NHL after autologous SCT or two or more prior lines of therapy, was 

completed in 2022. There have been no dose-limiting toxicities observed to-date. The manufacturing success rate and turnaround time are in line with other autologous CAR Ts despite the additional complexity of the product candidate. CRC-403 will serve as a potential proof-of-concept assessment of our proprietary gene editing platform, dual-targeting strategies and split co-stimulation signaling technology. Multiple clinical trial sites are currently recruiting patients who are either naïve to CD19 CAR T or who have relapsed after CD19 CAR T for the second dose level of the trial. The Phase 1 portion will be a dose-escalation study, with the Phase 2 stage allowing continued investigation of these two different patient populations at the recommended dose. The trial will be conducted at four study sites. 
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
We are developing our SC-DARIC33 product candidate for the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Systemic therapy (including chemotherapy, hypomethylating agents, and targeted biologics) alongside hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) are the mainstays of AML treatment today. Of note, many adult patients are unfit for such intensive therapy, which in turn leads to less favorable clinical outcomes. Though HSCT provides meaningful clinical benefit to those who are eligible, the unmet need in this heterogenous and aggressive disease remains high. Prognosis is typically poor for adult patients, with a 5-year survival rate of 10-35% depending on disease subtype. In children and adolescents, the 5-year survival rate is 50 to 70%, with variation by subtype and other risk factors as seen in adults. Of note, median overall survival in adults with relapsed and refractory AML is less than 12 months, indicating a particularly high unmet need for these patients.
Although CAR T therapy has shown transformative potential and durable efficacy in other hematologic tumors, their use in the treatment of AML is complicated by the expression of key AML targets, such as CD33, across healthy myeloid cells in addition to leukemic blasts and stem cells. Thus, a highly potent CAR T cell directed towards one of these targets carries the potential risk of significant “on-target, off-tumor” toxicity because of broad myeloid aplasia. Achieving durable remission with a CAR T while balancing the safety risks is a critical challenge for the treatment of AML with CAR T therapy. 
We seek to address this challenge with our SC-DARIC33 product candidate, which combines CAR T technology with DARIC, our dimerizing agent-regulated immunoreceptor complex technology. In our SC-DARIC33 product candidate, the traditional components of an anti-CD33 CAR are separated into two subunits which only enable T cell activation in the presence of sub-immunosuppressive doses of rapamycin, an orally-administered small molecule, which functions as an “on-off” toggle switch. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that this regulated activation is reversible upon withdrawal of rapamycin and can be subsequently re-activated upon re-administration of rapamycin. Our SC-DARIC33 product candidate is designed to utilize this on-off toggle switch in the context of an autologous CD33-directed DARIC-T cell to drive deep responses in AML while “on” and allow myeloid compartment recovery while “off”.
In collaboration with Seattle Children’s Therapeutics, we are enrolling patients in PLAT-08, an investigator-initiated single-center proof-of-concept Phase 1 clinical trial of SC-DARIC33 in pediatric and young adult relapsed or refractory AML patients. This dose-finding trial is aimed at establishing safety, manufacturability, and early efficacy signals for SC-DARIC33 and we expect to conduct correlative analyses to confirm rapamycin-driven regulation in humans. We are nearing completion of the mandatory adult dosing phase, and the totality of the initial data suggests SC-DARIC33 activation by rapamycin. In parallel, we are also advancing next-generation, preclinical product concepts for pediatric and adult AML in partnership with SCRI. These concepts include multiplex targeting and additional enhancement technologies to address the heterogeneity of disease and prevent relapse. Specifically, a next-generation AML product candidate has been selected and will enter non-clinical development in 2023. This new candidate is built off of our new RESET receptor architecture and incorporates dual targeting along with a potency enhancement while retaining the DARIC-like drug regulation. The terms of our arrangements with Seattle Children’s Therapeutics and SCRI are described more fully below under “Strategic Collaborations—Seattle Children’s.”
Multiple Myeloma
Multiple myeloma is a blood cancer caused by malignant plasma cells and typically originates in the bone marrow. In the United States, more than 34,000 new cases of multiple myeloma are estimated to have been diagnosed in 2021. Despite advances in treatment, multiple myeloma remains an aggressive and incurable disease characterized by periods of remission and relapse. Most patients experience relapse following initial therapies, and depth and duration of response as well as survival outcomes decrease with each successive treatment. No standard of care has been established for patients who have disease progression despite receiving the three main classes of myeloma therapy (immunomodulatory drugs, proteasome inhibitors, and anti-CD38 antibodies), and outcomes are poor, with very low response rates (20% to 30%), a median progression-free survival of three to four months, and a median overall survival of eight to nine months. Through our collaboration with BMS, Abecma (ide-cel) is our lead program in multiple myeloma. The terms of our arrangements with BMS are described more fully below under “Strategic Collaborations—BMS.” We are also conducting next-generation discovery programs in multiple myeloma on our own. 
Abecma and our collaboration with BMS. In March 2021, Abecma (idecabtagene vicleucel; ide-cel) was approved by the FDA in the United States for the treatment of adults with multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior lines of therapy, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. Abecma is a first-in-class B cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, CAR T therapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma, and represents our first oncology product candidate that has progressed from bluebird bio’s internal research programs, through clinical development to approval and commercialization, together with our collaboration partner, BMS. Gross revenue from sales of Abecma in the United States in 2022 equaled $297 million, which is shared equally between us and BMS along with the related cost of sales and other commercialization costs. Together with BMS, we are in the process of increasing U.S. testing and manufacturing capacity, and therefore overall U.S. supply chain capacity, for Abecma. 
 BCMA is a cell surface protein that is nearly universally expressed on cancer cells in multiple myeloma, and on normal plasma cells and mature B cells, but not other cells. As the first CAR T cell therapy approved for multiple myeloma, Abecma is a potentially transformative, single-infusion, individualized treatment that offers patients who have limited effective treatment options the potential for long-term disease control. The approval of Abecma in the United States was based on positive results from the pivotal KarMMa study. In the KarMMa study, the overall response rate was 73%, and 33% of patients achieved a complete response. Onset of response was rapid with a median time to first response of one month. Median duration of response was 10.7 months and 19 months for those who achieved a complete response. Abecma has a well-established safety profile with mostly low-grade cytokine release syndrome (Grade ≥3: 5%; grade ≤2 events: 84%) and neurologic toxicities (Grade ≥3: 3%; grade ≤2 events: 18%) with early onset and resolution. Results from the KarMMa study were published in the February 24, 2021 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. The FDA and EMA have granted Orphan Drug status to ide-cel for the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. The EMA has granted PRIME eligibility to ide-cel for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. BMS is conducting studies to support the use of Abecma in earlier lines of therapy. Our and BMS’ broad clinical development program for Abecma includes ongoing clinical trials in earlier lines of treatment for patients with multiple myeloma, including newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.
Additionally, under the collaboration arrangement with BMS, we have an option to co-develop and co-promote bb21217, an investigational BCMA-targeted CAR T cell therapy, within the United States. However, following our review of data from the CRB-402 clinical trial, and based in part on the strength of Abecma clinical data and commercial sales to date, we, together with BMS, do not intend to pursue further development of bb21217.
Next-generation approaches. CAR T therapies have transformed the treatment landscape in multiple myeloma and created the possibility for outcomes that were not possible with traditional therapies. Despite the significant advances that the current generation of CAR T therapies brought to patients, there are still significant challenges such as the need to improve duration of response and reduce manufacturing turnaround time. Our next-generation multiple myeloma program strategy is focused on leveraging our clinical experience from Abecma and bb21217, translational and correlative data, and technology platforms to solve definable and meaningful problems in the field. Leveraging our leadership in autologous CAR T therapy, our next-generation autologous multiple myeloma program utilizes multiple technologies including process improvements and dual targeting, with the goal of achieving best-in-

class efficacy through deeper and more durable responses than the current generation of autologous CAR T products. 
Solid Tumors
Solid tumors represent the next frontier for cell and gene therapies. Survival expectations in patients with solid tumor who have relapsed after existing therapies are often less than one year. While cell and gene therapies have demonstrated durable remission in hematologic malignancies, none have yet been approved for treating solid tumors. Key challenges to the discovery and development of cell and gene therapies in solid tumors includes the lack of strongly and selectively expressed targets as well as a hostile tumor microenvironment that serves as a barrier for T cells accessing the tumor and suppresses immune-mediated responses. We believe that our set of technologies, partnerships and cell and gene therapy experience enables the engineering of multiplex products to uniquely address the key challenges of solid tumors. Our research-stage programs in solid tumors include tumors expressing the MUC16 antigen and tumors expressing the MAGE-A4 antigen, among others. 
MUC16. Together with our partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Regeneron, we are advancing our bbT4015 product candidate, an engineered T cell therapy targeting MUC16, through preclinical studies. We anticipate submitting an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, for a clinical trial of bbT4015 in patients with ovarian cancer in 2023. This first in-human study will prospectively include combination agents, including those in Regeneron’s pipeline, and will be the first program to utilize our new in-house drug product manufacturing facility.
MUC16 is a large extracellular protein expressed on over 80% of ovarian tumors, including all ovarian subtypes. Its overexpression in tumors and relatively lower expression on normal tissues makes MUC16 an attractive ovarian cancer target for cellular therapies and a logical fit for the deployment of orthogonal enhancement strategies. Our MUC16 program incorporates a highly potent CAR T that targets a region close to the transmembrane (“nub” region) of MUC16 and is not inhibited by the presence of high concentrations of CA-125. Encouraging preclinical data suggests that T cells expressing the “nub”-directed MUC16 CAR T are able to clear tumors in a highly stringent ovarian cancer tumor rechallenge xenograft mouse model. We intend to combine this potent CAR T with a titratable pharmacologic agent with the goal of enhancing tumor control.
MAGE-A4. Over ten types of solid tumors express the MAGE-A4 antigen, making it a promising target for cell therapy, including lung, head and neck, gynecologic and gastric cancers. Together with our partner Regeneron we are advancing an engineered TCR therapy targeting MAGE-A4 through preclinical studies. We believe our MAGE-A4 program has the potential to address the challenges of solid tumors in a three-pronged way: (1) we have identified a potent T cell receptor targeting a prevalent intracellular peptide antigen from MAGE-A4, (2) engineered this receptor for a strong anti-tumor response, and (3) incorporated an innovative switch receptor (CTBR12) that converts the highly suppressive TGFβ signal in the hostile tumor microenvironment into a potent T cell intrinsic activation signal. The TGFβ signaling pathway has been broadly implicated as a key suppressive factor in the TME of multiple MAGEA4+ indications, including non-small cell lung, bladder, ovarian, and head and neck carcinomas. In 2022, we entered into an agreement with JW (Cayman) Therapeutics Co. Ltd., or JW Therapeutics, to clinically evaluate this potency enhanced MAGE-A4 TCR program. JW Therapeutics plans an investigator-initiated trial in China in 2023, initially focused on esophageal carcinoma. 
Hemophilia A
Together with our partners Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk”) and Genevant Sciences Corporation (“Genevant”), we are also conducting preclinical studies of our product candidate in hemophilia A. Hemophilia A is a serious and rare inherited disease characterized by insufficient blood clotting that results from the lack of functional factor VIII, or FVIII. Hemophilia A is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes the coagulation FVIII protein. Our approach employs our gene editing technology (megaTALs) to insert a corrective copy of the FVIII gene directly into the genome of liver cells. We believe that this targeted integration approach may result in permanently corrected cells that have the potential to provide durable expression of therapeutic levels of FVIII protein.
Manufacturing 
We have entered into agreements with external manufacturing partners in the United States and Europe to support our various preclinical and clinical programs in oncology, and to support Abecma commercial vector supply. In addition, we have recently added a Phase 1 drug product cell therapy manufacturing facility in our Cambridge, Massachusetts headquarters, which we anticipate will be operational by mid-2023. We believe this manufacturing facility will enable us to rapidly iterate on clinical learnings in the development of our pipeline programs. We also have a strategic manufacturing collaboration with Resilience to increase the efficiency of vector manufacturing processes for cell and gene therapies to reduce the cost of supply and enable patient access.
Strategic Collaborations
Given our multiplex approach to the discovery and development of next-generation cell and gene therapies for cancer, we have partnered strategically to access complementary technologies and disease-area expertise. We also have historically formed collaborations to access the substantial funding and other resources required to develop and commercialize cell and gene therapies for cancer. Currently, our strategic collaborations in oncology include:
Bristol Myers Squibb. bluebird bio began a collaboration with BMS in 2013 under a broad-ranging Master Collaboration Agreement with Celgene Corporation (now BMS following its acquisition of Celgene in November 2019) (the “BMS Collaboration Agreement”). bluebird bio continued that collaboration with a series of agreements described below. In connection with the separation, bluebird bio assigned to us all of the agreements relating to its collaboration with BMS. 
BMS Collaboration Agreement
In March 2013, bluebird bio entered into the BMS Collaboration Agreement to discover, develop and commercialize potentially disease-altering gene therapies in oncology. bluebird bio concurrently entered into a Platform Technology Sublicense Agreement (the “Sublicense Agreement”) with BMS pursuant to which bluebird bio obtained a sublicense to certain intellectual property from BMS, originating under BMS’s license from Baylor College of Medicine, for use in the collaboration.
In June 2015, both parties amended and restated the BMS Collaboration Agreement (the “Amended BMS Collaboration Agreement”) to narrow the focus of the collaboration to exclusively work on anti-B-cell maturation antigen (“BCMA”) product candidates for a new three-year term. 
On a product candidate-by-product candidate basis, up through a specified period following enrollment of the first patient in an initial Phase 1 clinical trial for such product candidate, BMS had an option to obtain an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize such product. Following BMS’s license of each product candidate, we are entitled to elect to co-develop and co-promote each product candidate in the United States.
BMS Ide-cel related agreements
In February 2016, BMS exercised its option to obtain an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize ide-cel, the first product candidate under the Amended BMS Collaboration Agreement, pursuant to an executed license agreement (“Ide-cel License Agreement”) and paid the associated $10.0 million option fee. Pursuant to the Ide-cel License Agreement, BMS was responsible for development and related funding of ide-cel after the substantial completion of the Phase 1 clinical trial. bluebird bio was responsible for the manufacture of vector and associated payload throughout development and, upon BMS’s request, throughout commercialization, the costs of which were reimbursable by BMS in accordance with the terms of the Amended and Restated Co-Development, Co-Promote and Profit Share Agreement, as further described below. BMS was responsible for the manufacture of drug product throughout development and commercialization. Under the Ide-cel License Agreement, bluebird bio was eligible to receive (i) U.S. milestones of up to $85.0 million for the first indication to be addressed by ide-cel and royalties for U.S. sales of ide-cel and (ii) ex-U.S. milestones of up to $55.0 million and royalties for ex-U.S. sales of ide-cel.

In March 2018, bluebird bio elected to co-develop and co-promote ide-cel within the United States pursuant to the execution of the Amended and Restated Co-Development, Co-Promote and Profit Share Agreement (“Ide-cel CCPS”), which replaced the Ide-cel License Agreement. As a result, we will share equally in all profits and losses related to developing, commercializing and manufacturing ide-cel within the United States and have the right to participate in the development and promotion of ide-cel in the United States. BMS is responsible for the costs incurred to manufacture vector and associated payload for use outside of the United States, plus a markup. As a result of electing to co-develop and co-promote ide-cel within the United States, the milestones and royalties payable under the Ide-cel License Agreement were adjusted. Under the Ide-cel CCPS, bluebird bio was eligible to receive a $10.0 million milestone related to the development of ide-cel in the United States and, for the first indication to be addressed by ide-cel, ex-U.S. regulatory and commercial milestones of up to $60.0 million. Under the Ide-cel CCPS, the $10.0 million milestone related to the development of ide-cel in the United States was achieved in the second quarter of 2019 and subsequently paid by BMS.
BMS bb21217 License Agreement
In September 2017, BMS exercised its option to obtain an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize bb21217, an investigational BCMA-targeted CAR T cell therapy, the second product candidate under the Amended BMS Collaboration Agreement, pursuant to an executed license agreement (“bb21217 License Agreement”) and paid bluebird bio an option fee of $15.0 million. Pursuant to the bb21217 License Agreement, BMS is responsible for development and related funding of bb21217 after the substantial completion of the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial. In 2019, the parties amended the protocol for the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial to enroll additional patients for which we were reimbursed an agreed-upon amount per patient. Under the bb21217 License Agreement, we are eligible to receive U.S. milestones of up to $85.0 million for the first indication to be addressed by bb21217 and royalties for U.S. sales of bb21217. Additionally, the Company was eligible to receive ex-U.S. milestones of up to $55.0 million and royalties for ex-U.S. sales of bb21217.
May 2020 Amendments to Ide-cel and bb21217 agreements
In May 2020, the First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Co-Development, Co-Promote and Profit Share Agreement (as amended, the "Amended Ide-cel CCPS") and the Second Amended and Restated License Agreement ("Amended bb21217 License Agreement" and, collectively with the Amended Ide-cel CCPS, the “May 2020 Amendments”), which replaced the bb21217 License Agreement, were executed. Under the Amended Ide-cel CCPS, the parties will continue to share equally in all profits and losses related to developing, commercializing and manufacturing ide-cel within the United States. However, the Amended Ide-cel CCPS changed our responsibilities with respect to manufacturing activities. Under the Amended Ide-cel CCPS, BMS assumed the contract manufacturing agreements related to ide-cel adherent lentiviral vector. Over time, BMS is also assuming responsibility for manufacturing ide-cel suspension lentiviral vector outside of the United States, while we remain responsible for manufacturing ide-cel suspension lentiviral vector in the United States. 
Under the Amended bb21217 License Agreement, BMS is assuming responsibility for manufacturing suspension lentiviral vector outside of the United States over time, while we remain responsible for manufacturing suspension lentiviral vector in the United States. Under the Amended bb21217 License Agreement, expenses that we incur associated with these activities are fully reimbursable by BMS at cost plus a mark-up. Throughout both development and commercialization, BMS is responsible for the manufacture of drug product.
The May 2020 Amendments relieved BMS of its obligations to pay us for future ex-U.S. milestones and royalties on ex-U.S. sales for each of ide-cel and bb21217 in exchange for an up-front, non-refundable, non-creditable payment of $200.0 million, which represents the aggregate of the probability-weighted, net present value of the future ex-U.S. milestones and royalties on ex-U.S. sales for each of ide-cel and bb21217. In addition, the parties are released from future exclusivity related to BCMA-directed T cell therapies. There are no remaining milestones or royalties under the Amended Ide-cel CCPS. The Amended Ide-cel CCPS will continue on a country-by-country basis until there are no more payments owed by either party on ide-cel in such country, unless earlier terminated (a) by mutual consent of the parties, (b) by us following a material breach by BMS that remains uncured after a specified period, (c) by us at our discretion, following a specified notice period, (d) by BMS following a 

material breach by us that remains uncured after a specified period, (e) by BMS at its discretion, following a specified notice period, or (f) pursuant to certain other negotiated termination provisions.
In March 2021, the FDA approved the marketing of Ide-cel as Abecma in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after four or more prior lines of therapy, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. Under the Amended Ide-cel CCPS, BMS is primarily responsible for the commercialization of Abecma. As previously described, under the collaboration arrangement with BMS, we have an option to co-develop and co-promote bb21217 within the United States. However, following completion of the CRB-402 clinical trial, in January 2022 we, along with BMS, evaluated our plans with respect to bb21217. Based in part on the strength of Abecma clinical data and commercial sales to date, we and BMS elected to discontinue development of bb21217 and, as such, we did not exercise our option to co-develop and co-promote bb21217 within the United States. We are still eligible to receive U.S. milestones and royalties for U.S. sales of bb21217, if further developed by BMS. Additionally, pursuant to the terms of the collaboration agreement, because we did not exercise our option to co-develop and co-promote bb21217, we received an additional fee in the amount of $10.0 million from BMS during the second quarter of 2022.
Seattle Children’s. Through our collaboration with Seattle Children’s Therapeutics, a non-profit enterprise associated with Seattle Children’s (“SCRI”), we and SCRI are working to advance the clinical development of SC-DARIC33 as a treatment for patients with AML.
Regeneron. We have a broad collaboration with Regeneron covering the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel cell and gene therapies for cancer. Through this collaboration, we have access to Regeneron’s platform technologies for the discovery and characterization of fully human antibodies as well as T cell receptors against tumor-specific proteins and peptides that we may leverage in our collaboration programs.
JW Therapeutics. Through our agreement with JW Therapeutics, we are collaborating to establish a translational and clinical cell therapy development platform designed to more rapidly explore T cell-based immunotherapy products in the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong (China), and Macao (China).
Medigene. Through our collaboration, we have access to Medigene’s proprietary platform for the generation and design of T cell receptors that we may leverage in our product candidates.
Inhibrx. Through our collaboration, we have access to Inhibrx’s proprietary single-domain antibody platform to multiple cancer targets that we may leverage in our product candidates.
Gritstone Oncology. Through our collaboration with Gritstone, we intend to seek to validate cancer targets and discover T cell receptors that we may leverage in our product candidates.
Novo Nordisk. We have a collaboration with Novo Nordisk focused on the in vivo application of our megaTAL gene-editing technology to treat hemophilia A.
Genevant. Through our collaboration, we have access to Genevant’s lipid nanoparticle, or LNP, technology platform for use in our collaboration with Novo Nordisk for the treatment of patients with hemophilia A. We intend to use Genevant’s LNP platform in the delivery of megaTAL mRNA to hepatocyte cells within the liver.
We are also party to additional significant academic collaborations for the discovery, preclinical development, and initial clinical proof-of-concept of our product concepts, such as our collaboration with the University of North Carolina. 
License Agreements
Biogen. In August 2014, bluebird bio entered into a license agreement with Biogen, pursuant to which bluebird bio co-exclusively licensed certain patents and patent applications directed towards aspects of T cell-based products that target BCMA. In connection with the separation, bluebird bio assigned this license agreement to us. Biogen retains the right to practice and use the licensed patents in the licensed field and territory. We have the right to grant sublicenses to third parties, subject to certain conditions. We are obligated to pay Biogen a percentage (in the low single digits) of net sales of products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, including Abecma, as a 

royalty. Additionally, we are subject to certain development and regulatory milestone obligations and must report on our progress in achieving those milestones on a periodic basis. We may be obligated to pay up to $23.0 million in the aggregate for each licensed product upon the achievement of remaining milestones. We may unilaterally terminate the license agreement at any time with prior written notice to Biogen. Either party may terminate the license in the event of the other party’s material breach upon notice and following an opportunity for the breaching party to cure. Either party may also terminate the agreement in the event bankruptcy proceedings are opened against the other party and are not dismissed within a specified period of time. Absent early termination, the agreement will automatically terminate upon the expiration of all patent rights covered by the agreement or ten years from the date of first commercial sale of a licensed product, whichever is later. The longest lived patent rights licensed to us are in a U.S. patent, currently expected to expire in 2032.
NIH. In August 2015, bluebird bio entered into a license agreement with the NIH, pursuant to which bluebird bio exclusively licensed certain patents and patent applications directed towards aspects of T cell-based products that target BCMA. In connection with the separation, bluebird bio assigned this license agreement to us. Any patents within this portfolio that have issued or may yet issue would have an expected statutory expiration date in 2033 to 2034. The NIH retains the right to practice the intellectual property licensed under the agreement on behalf of the government of the United States. We have the right to grant sublicenses to third parties, subject to certain conditions. For each such sublicense we grant we must pay the NIH a fee. Upon commercialization of our products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, which includes Abecma, we will be obligated to pay the NIH a percentage of net sales as a royalty in the low single digits. We are subject to a domestic production requirement that licensed products, such as Abecma, sold or used in the U.S. or produced through use of the licensed processes must be manufactured substantially in the U.S., unless a waiver is obtained in advance from the NIH. Additionally, we are subject to certain development and regulatory milestone obligations and must report on our progress in achieving those milestones on a periodic basis. We may be obligated to pay up to $9.7 million in the aggregate for a licensed product upon the achievement of these milestones. We may unilaterally terminate the license agreement at any time with prior written notice to the NIH. The NIH may terminate the license in the event of our material breach upon notice and following an opportunity for us to cure the material breach. The NIH may also terminate the agreement in the event bankruptcy proceedings are opened against us and are not dismissed within a specified period of time. Absent early termination, the agreement will automatically terminate upon the expiration of the patent rights covered by the agreement. The longest lived patent rights licensed to us under the Agreement are currently expected to expire in 2034.
Institut Pasteur. Under a 2011 license agreement, Institut Pasteur granted a license to bluebird bio for certain patents relating to the use of DNA sequences, LVV and recombinant cells in the field of ex vivo gene therapy and CAR T cell-based therapy in a range of indications, excluding vaccinations (the “Licensed Pasteur IP”). In February 2023, we entered into a partial assumption and assignment agreement with bluebird bio and Institut Pasteur, by which bluebird bio assigned us its rights, obligations and interests under the 2011 license agreement, to any and all uses of the Licensed Pasteur IP in connection with the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of oncological diseases or disorders and hemophilia. We will pay Institut Pasteur an annual maintenance payment, a percentage of income received in the event of sublicensing arrangements and, upon commercialization of products covered by the Licensed Pasteur IP, a percentage of net sales as a royalty, which varies depending on the indication of the product. Prior to entering into the partial assignment and assumption agreement, the Licensed Pasteur IP was sublicensed by bluebird bio to us under the Intellectual Property License Agreement, dated as of November 3, 2021, entered into in connection with the Separation. The Agreement may be terminated for a substantial breach by either Party that is not cured within 60 days of notification of the substantial breach. 2seventy may terminate the agreement by providing to Institut Pasteur 90 days prior written notice.
bluebird bio. We entered into an intellectual property license agreement in connection with the separation with bluebird bio pursuant to which each party granted a license to certain intellectual property and technology. bluebird bio granted us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid-up license to certain intellectual property to allow us to use such intellectual property in connection with our ongoing and future research and development activities and product candidates. We granted to bluebird bio a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid-up license (or, as the case may be, sublicense) to certain intellectual property for use in 

bluebird bio’s existing products and product candidates. Such licenses between the parties generally allow current or future uses of the intellectual property in connection with each party's respective fields. 
Competition 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by intense and rapidly changing competition to develop new technologies and proprietary products. Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and the commercialization of those treatments. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments. Our competitors’ treatments may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any treatment for which we receive marketing approval and may render our approved treatments obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our treatments.
These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payers seeking to encourage the use of different products driven by cost, discounts, or rebates. If our therapeutic product candidates are approved, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products. Depending on how successful these competitive efforts are, it is possible they may increase the barriers to adoption and success of our approved product and product candidates. 
We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any treatments that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, customer experience, reliability, convenience of administration and delivery, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers.
These efforts include the following:
Multiple Myeloma. The current standard of care for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma includes IMiDs (e.g., thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide), proteasome inhibitors (e.g., bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib), monoclonal antibodies (e.g., daratumamab, isatuximab, elotuzumab), cytotoxic agents, and HSCT. There are several companies developing autologous T cell therapies for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma that use a similar autologous ex vivo approach, but a different target antigen, BCMA single-chain variable fragment or, we believe, cell processing techniques. These programs include: ciltacabtagene autoleucel, an anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy marketed as Carvykti that was approved by the FDA in February 2022 (Janssen in collaboration with Legend Biotech); a CAR T-ddBCMA cell therapy in clinical development (pivotal Phase 2 iMMagine-1) jointly developed by Arcellx in partnership with Kite; an anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy in clinical development (Phase 1) sponsored by BMS following the completion of its acquisition of Juno Therapeutics, Inc. and several other anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapies in Phase 1 study, including and not limited to Novartis and Gracell Biotechnologies Inc. In addition to these autologous T cell-based approaches, Allogene Therapeutics, Inc., Poseida, and CRISPR Therapeutics AG have disclosed preclinical and clinical programs for allogeneic BCMA targeted CAR T cell therapies. There are also other therapies using similar or novel modalities being developed by several groups, including multiple bispecific T cell engagers and specific antibody therapies, such as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). In October 2022, the FDA approved Tecvayli (teclistamab, first-in-class BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody) for patients with at least four prior therapies in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma becoming the first treatment option with this modality to gain approval in the US. Two other BCMA-directed bispecific antibodies, Pfizer’s elranatamab and Regeneron’s linvoseltamab are expected to be approved in 2023 and 2024, respectively. In addition to Tecvayli, potential approval of another bispecific antibody developed by Janssen, talquetemab (first-in-class GPRC5DxCD3), is expected in the second half of 2023. After GSK noted the failure of the Phase 3 confirmatory DREAMM-3 study in 

3L+ relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, following the request of the FDA, GSK announced plans for full market withdrawal of Blenrep (BCMA targeting ADC). GSK continues to develop Blenrep, and the data from the Phase 3 DREAMM-7 and DREAMM-8 studies in 2L relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma expected in the first half of 2023 will inform their future regulatory pathways.
B Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. The current standard of care for majority of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or NHL, is focused around CD20 immunotherapy, mainly rituximab, combined with chemotherapy agents such as bendamustine or the four-drug cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) regimen as the first-line option; patients with certain mutations may receive a different chemotherapy cocktail called EPOCH. As patients fail these therapies and reach the relapsed/refractory setting, patients who are eligible for stem cell transplant have typically received CD20 antibodies and high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation, or HDCT-ASCT. CD19 CAR T cell therapies axicabtagene ciloleucel (marked as Yescarta) and lisocabtagene maraleucel (marketed as Breyanzi) were both approved in 2022 for patients refractory to or relapsing within 12 months of initial therapy, replacing HDCT-ASCT as the standard of care for many patients; lisocabtagene maraleucel was also approved in the US for patients who are deemed ineligible for HDCT-ASCT. Axicabtagene ciloleucel and lisocabtagene maraleucel were also previously approved and launched as therapies for NHL patients who had failed at least two prior therapies, as was a third CD19 CAR T, tisagenlecleucel (marketed as Kymriah). More than 60 development programs for NHL therapies are in Phase 1 through Phase 3 trials in the US, including over 20 CAR T cell therapies, most of which target CD19. Among these programs are three dual targeting assets: Miltenyi’s zamtocabtagene autoleucel, a CD19/20 targeting CAR T currently in two potentially registrational Phase 2 trials, Cellular Biomedicine Group’s C-CAR039, a CD19/20 targeting CAR T which opened a Phase 1 trial in the US in 2022, and Autolus Therapeutics’ AUTO3, a CD19/22 dual targeting CAR T for relapsed/refractory NHL with promising Phase 1/2 data which Autolus Therapeutics is aiming to partner or out-license. Most cell therapies, marketed or in the clinic, are exploring patient populations across the treatment paradigm with expectations of replacing current standard of care and procuring expanded labels. In addition to autologous therapies, efforts are ongoing for allogeneic platforms that offer “off-the-shelf” advantage with the option of potentially treating greater number of patients over currently marketed CARs. ALLO-501A, PBCAR0191, CTX110, and ADI-001 have shown promising preliminary data in R/R NHL including patients failed on or refractory to prior CARs, and potentially registrational trials have been initiated for ALLO-501A and CTX110. Beyond cell therapies, Roche’s CD79b-targeting anti-body drug conjugate, polatuzumab vedotin (marketed as Polivy), received approval in relapsed/refractory NHL in the US in 2019 and a broader EMA approval in patients not eligible for stem cell transplant; polatuzumab also showed promising Phase 3 data in newly diagnosed NHL but has not yet been approved in that setting. Another anti-body drug conjugate, ADC Therapeutics’ CD19-targeting loncastuximab tesirine (marketed as Zynlonta), was approved in relapsed/refractory NHL patients after at least two prior therapies in the US in 2021. Morphosys’ tafasitamab (marketed as Monjuvi), a CD-19 targeted antibody, was approved and launched in 2020 in the US in combination with lenalidomide for patients with relapsed or refractory disease ineligible for HDCT-ASCT. Bispecific antibody therapies include Roche’s glofitamab, Genmab and AbbVie’s epcoritamab, and Regeneron’s odronextamab (all CD20 X CD3). Roche and AbbVie have filed BLAs for their respective agents, and Regeneron is expected to submit a BLA for odronextamab in 2023.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia. The current standard of care for AML has changed in the last few years following a host of new small molecule and monoclonal antibody approvals since 2017: midostaurin (commercialized by Novartis), liposomal daunorubicin and cytarabine (commercialized by Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc), enasidenib (commercialized by BMS and Servier), gemtuzumab ozogamicin (commercialized by Pfizer), ivosidenib (commercialized by Servier), gilteritinib (commercialized by Astellas Pharma), venetoclax (commercialized by AbbVie and Genentech), and glasdegib (commercialized by Pfizer). Many of these drugs are first in class and some are biomarker driven, resulting in more segmentation in the AML treatment paradigm. There are several competitors exploring autologous CAR T therapies in Phase 1 trials for relapsed and refractory AML, some against targets that have approved monoclonal antibody competitors on the market already, while others have novel targets. Dual targeting CAR T cell-based approaches are also starting to enter the clinic, including the CD33/CLL-1 targeting CAR Ts being developed by iCell Gene Therapeutics and Legend Biotech. Other groups are exploring TCR-based autologous therapies against novel targets. In addition to autologous cell therapies, there are allogeneic CAR T cell therapies in early trials for AML, including MB-102 in a Phase 1 trial being developed by Mustang Bio, Inc, and UCART123 in a Phase 1 trial being developed by Cellectis as well as NK cell-based therapies. Other modalities, 

such as bispecific antibodies, ADCs, and other immunotherapy-based approaches are also in development across a wide range of targets. For example, Janssen is developing JNJ-67571244, a bispecific antibody targeting CD33 and CD3, for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML, and Immunogen is developing pivekimab sunirine (IMGN632), a CD123 ADC, as monotherapy or in combination with azacytidine +/- venetoclax in relapsed or refractory or newly diagnosed AML. In addition, Gilead is investigating magrolimab, a CD47 targeting antibody, through two ongoing pivotal Phase 3 studies: ENHANCE-3 investigating magrolimab combined with venetoclax and azacytidine in newly diagnosed intensive chemotherapy unfit AML patients and ENHANCE-2 magrolimab in combination with azacytidine vs. physicians’ choice of venetoclax and azacytidine or intensive chemotherapy in newly diagnosed TP53 mutant AML patients. Data is expected for both studies in 2024.
Other Cell and Gene-Based Immunotherapies in Oncology. Hundreds of academic laboratories, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical companies are researching and developing cell-based immunotherapies in oncology, in addition to the programs described above. These include and are not limited to Novartis AG, Adaptimmune Inc., Bristol Myers Squibb Inc., Gilead Sciences, Inc., Pfizer Inc., Amgen, Inc., Sanofi, and Takeda among others. Many of the cell-based immunotherapy programs being developed by these companies are in Phase 1/2 clinical trials for multiple indications in hematologic and solid tumors. Given the complexities of treating heterogeneous solid tumors, early data from cell therapies is very limited and needs extensive exploration and validation. Cancer therapies in other modalities, such as bispecific antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, and dendritic cell vaccines, as well as combinatorial approaches are also in development across a wide range of targets and pose a competitive threat. 
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology platform and on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of gene therapy that may be important for the development of our business. Additionally, we rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations, data exclusivity, market exclusivity, and patent term extensions and supplementary protection certificates where available.
Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have valid and enforceable patent rights or trade secrets that cover these activities. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same.
We have developed or in-licensed numerous patents and patent applications and possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of gene therapy products. Our proprietary intellectual property, including patent and non-patent intellectual property, is generally directed to, for example, certain genes, transgenes, methods of transferring genetic material into cells, genetically modified cells, processes to manufacture our lentivirus-based approved product and product candidates and other proprietary technologies and processes related to our approved product and product candidates. As of February 8, 2023, our patent portfolio includes the following:
•66 patents or patent applications that we own or have exclusively or co-exclusively in-licensed from third parties related to lentiviral vectors and vector manufacturing or production;

•163 patents or patent applications that we own or have exclusively or co-exclusively in-licensed from third parties related to therapeutic cellular product candidates;
•6 patents or patent applications that we have non-exclusively in-licensed or optioned from third parties related to oncology and therapeutic T cells;
•660 patents or patent applications that we own, have exclusively or co-exclusively in-licensed, or optioned from third parties related to oncology product candidates, including CAR T cell vector systems and manufacturing, T cell manufacturing, and therapeutic T cells;
•179 patents or patent applications that we own or have exclusively or co-exclusively in-licensed from third parties related to gene-editing compositions and methods; and
•2 patent applications that we have non-exclusively in-licensed from third parties related to gene-editing compositions and methods.
Our objective is to continue to expand our portfolio of patents and patent applications in order to protect our gene therapy product candidates and manufacturing processes. Examples of the products and technology areas covered by our intellectual property portfolio are described below. See also “—Strategic Collaborations.” From time to time, we also evaluate opportunities to sublicense our portfolio of patents and patent applications that we own or exclusively license, and we may enter into such licenses from time to time.
While we maintain patents and patent applications in important foreign markets, such as in Europe, China, and Japan, we do not consider our patent portfolio outside of the United States to be material to 2seventy bio at this time. With respect to the patent portfolios for our commercial-stage product idecabtagene vicleucel, or ide-cel, development and commercialization rights have been exclusively licensed to BMS in exchange for an up-front payment. As a consequence, 2seventy bio will not receive royalties on sales of ide-cel outside of the United States. 
In addition, our other oncology programs are preclinical and we have not initiated the clinical trials for these programs either in the United States or elsewhere. As a result, we do not view the patent portfolios for these programs to be material to 2seventy bio at this time.

We expect any other patents in this portfolio, if issued from the pending patent applications and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, to expire in 2034 (worldwide, excluding possible patent term extensions).
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier expiring patent. Our patents expire at various times over the next 20 years, with patent protection for some expiring from 2023 through 2027. We do not expect such expirations to materially affect our business as the patents set to expire during this time cover intellectual property that is used in combination with other proprietary technologies, which technologies are therefore are covered by patents and patent applications with expiration dates beyond 2027. For these reasons, among others, we believe that no single patent expiration would have a material adverse effect on our business as a whole.
The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Moreover, a patent 

can only be extended once, and thus, if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a BLA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our approved products or methods of using the same.
We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and third parties. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
The Separation and Distribution
In January 2021, bluebird bio announced its plans to separate its oncology portfolio and programs from its severe genetic disease portfolio and programs and spin off its oncology portfolio and programs into a separate publicly traded company, 2seventy bio. In furtherance of this plan, 2seventy bio was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in April 2021, and in September 2021, bluebird bio’s board of directors approved the distribution of all of the issued and outstanding shares of 2seventy bio common stock on the basis of one share of 2seventy bio common stock for every three shares of bluebird bio common stock issued and outstanding on October 19, 2021, the record date for the distribution. 
On November 3, 2021 we entered into a separation agreement with bluebird bio, which is referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the separation agreement, as well as various other agreements with bluebird bio, including a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, an intellectual property license agreement, a transition services agreement under which we temporarily receive certain services from bluebird bio, and a second transition services agreement under which we temporarily provide certain services to bluebird bio. These agreements also govern certain of our relationships with bluebird bio after the separation. For additional information regarding the separation agreement and the other related agreements, see "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Separation" and "Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions—Agreements with bluebird bio." As a result of the distribution, we became an independent, publicly traded company on November 4, 2021.
Government Regulation
In the United States, biological products, including cell and gene therapy products, are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, research, development, manufacturing, quality control, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, approval, reporting, import, export, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products. FDA authorization must be obtained before clinical testing of biological products, and each clinical study protocol for a gene therapy product is reviewed by the FDA. FDA approval also must be obtained before marketing of biological products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals.
Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, regulates cell and gene therapy products. CBER works closely with the NIH. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols. The FDA also has published guidance documents related to, among other things, gene therapy products in general, their preclinical assessment, observing 

subjects involved in gene therapy studies for delayed adverse events, potency testing, and chemistry, manufacturing and control information in gene therapy INDs.
Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from successfully commercializing our product or any future products. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
United States Biological Products Development Process
The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an application for an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin and must be updated annually and when certain changes are made;
•approval by an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
•submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical studies, and payment of a user fee, unless waived;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with good manufacturing practices, or GMPs, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDA’s current good tissue practices, or GTPs, for the use of human cellular and tissue products;
•potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
•FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
Before testing any biological product candidate in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.
The clinical study sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns 

before the clinical study can begin. A clinical hold may either be a full clinical hold or a partial clinical hold that would limit a trial, for example, to certain doses or for a certain length of time or to a certain number of subjects. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, studies may not commence or recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such studies.
In addition to the submission of an IND to the FDA before initiation of a clinical trial in the United States, certain clinical studies of cells containing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules, including human gene transfer studies, are subject to oversight of institutional biosafety committees, or IBCs, as set forth in the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules, or the NIH Guidelines. Specifically, under the NIH Guidelines, supervision of human gene transfer trials includes evaluation and assessment by an IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules conducted at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment, and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA; however, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. Such trials remain subject to FDA and other clinical trial regulations, and only after FDA, IBC, and other relevant approvals are in place can these protocols proceed.
Clinical studies involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor’s control. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and effectiveness, including stopping rules that assure a clinical study will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical studies must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed.
Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients who have the disease or condition the product candidate is intended to treat. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, evaluate the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.
•Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
•Phase 3. Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product 

approval and labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of a BLA.
Post-approval clinical studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. In some cases, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a BLA. The FDA generally recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by ten years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire, of study subjects.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH, as applicable, and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Human gene therapy products are a new category of therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the study period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the studies in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of human gene therapy products, or that the data generated in these studies will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval. 
Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life and to identify appropriate storage conditions for the product candidate.
United States Review and Approval Processes
After the completion of clinical studies of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, as amended, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. The testing and approval 

processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with GMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. Each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee, and the sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to an annual program fee. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For a cell or gene therapy product, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with the GTPs. These are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical studies were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure GMP, GTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application, or request a hearing.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 clinical studies, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.

One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA is to review 90% of standard BLAs in 10 months and 90% of priority BLAs in six months, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983 or the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a new drug application, or NDA, or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan designation may also be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of the patient with the rare disease or condition. Orphan product designation in the EU has similar, but not identical, benefits.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has established several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs and biologics to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval.
New drugs and biological products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a fast track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. The FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. A product may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review, accelerated approval, and breakthrough therapy designation. Under the breakthrough therapy program, products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may be eligible for the benefits of the fast track program when preliminary clinical evidence demonstrates that such product may have substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. Breakthrough Therapy designation includes all of the benefits of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive 

guidance on a development program beginning as early as Phase 1. Additionally, FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product receives timely advice and interactive communications to help the sponsor design and conduct a development program as efficiently as possible. A product may also be eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies. Under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, or FDORA, the FDA is now permitted to require, as appropriate, that such trials be underway prior to approval or within a specific time period after the date of approval for a product granted accelerated approval. Sponsors are also required to send updates to the FDA every 180 days on the status of such studies, including progress toward enrollment targets, and the FDA must promptly post this information publicly. Under FDORA, the FDA has increased authority for expedited procedures to withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the sponsor fails to conduct such studies in a timely manner and send the necessary updates to the FDA, or if a confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. In addition, for products being considered for accelerated approval, the FDA currently requires, unless otherwise informed by the agency, that all advertising and promotional materials intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days of marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapies Designation
As part of the 21st Century Cures Act, Congress amended the FD&C Act to facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of regenerative medicine advanced therapies, which include cell and gene therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products. Regenerative medicine advanced therapies do not include those human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products regulated solely under section 361 of the PHS Act and 21 CFR Part 1271. This program is intended to facilitate efficient development and expedite review of regenerative medicine therapies, which are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and qualify for RMAT designation. A drug sponsor may request that FDA designate a drug as an RMAT concurrently with or at any time after submission of an IND. FDA has 60 calendar days to determine whether the drug meets the criteria, including whether there is preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. A BLA for a regenerative medicine therapy that has received RMAT designation may be eligible for priority review or accelerated approval through use of surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites. Benefits of RMAT designation also include early interactions with FDA to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoint to be used to support accelerated approval. A regenerative medicine therapy with RMAT designation that is granted accelerated approval and is subject to post-approval requirements may fulfill such requirements through the submission of clinical evidence from clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real world evidence, such as electronic health records; the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to its approval.
Post-Approval Requirements
Maintaining compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to GMP. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on 

third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any future products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the GMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. For certain commercial prescription drug and biologic products, manufacturers and other parties involved in the supply chain must also meet chain of distribution requirements and build electronic, interoperable systems for product tracking and tracing and for notifying the FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products or other products that are otherwise unfit for distribution in the United States. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products include reporting of GMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products.
Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMPs and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain GMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, companies that manufacture or distribute drug or biological products or that hold approved BLAs must comply with other regulatory requirements, including submitting annual reports, reporting information about adverse drug experiences, and maintaining certain records. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a drug’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures, including a REMS or the conduct of post-marketing studies to assess a newly-discovered safety issue.
We also must comply with the FDA’s and other jurisdictions’ advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising and advertising to healthcare professionals, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. Consequences could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with healthcare professionals, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. Although physicians may prescribe approved products for off-label use, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties, including liabilities under the False Claims Act where products carry 

reimbursement under federal health care programs. Promotional materials for approved biologics must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication.
United States Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date and only those claims covering such approved biological product, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
A biological product can obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Affordable Care Act, signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or the BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The BPCIA attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 
Under the BPCIA, a reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product, and an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) 18 months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution in the applicant’s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologics’ patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period. The FDA may approve multiple “first” interchangeable products so long as they are all approved on the same first day of marketing, and the exclusivity period may be shared among multiple first interchangeable products.
Healthcare and Privacy Laws
In addition to restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state/federal laws and trade association membership codes of conduct have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include Anti-Kickback and false claims statutes. The United States federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully 

offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. A person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, imprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend pharmaceutical and biological products, including certain discounts, or engaging healthcare professionals or patients as speakers or consultants, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within the exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational and research grants or patient assistance programs.
The United States federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payers if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have faced enforcement actions under the federal False Claims Act for, among other things, allegedly submitting false or misleading pricing information to government health care programs and providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have faced enforcement actions for causing false claims to be submitted because of the company’s marketing the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. Federal enforcement agencies also have showed increased interest in pharmaceutical companies’ product and patient assistance programs, including reimbursement and co-pay support services, and a number of investigations into these programs have resulted in significant civil and criminal settlements. In addition, the Affordable Care Act amended federal law to provide that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Criminal prosecution is possible for making or presenting a false or fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, also created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
The United States Federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to engage in extensive tracking of payments and other transfers of value to physicians, certain other licensed health care practitioners and teaching hospitals, including physician ownership and investment interests, and public reporting of such data. Pharmaceutical and biological manufacturers with products for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Program are required to track such payments, and must submit a report on or before the 90th day of each calendar year disclosing reportable payments made in the previous calendar year. Additionally, federal government price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex 

pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs and consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers, may apply to us. A number of other countries, states and municipalities have also implemented additional payment tracking and reporting requirements, which if not done correctly may result in additional penalties.
In addition, the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any official of another country, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in that capacity. In many other countries, healthcare professionals who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by government entities, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities. Our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers may be subject to the FCPA.
Other countries, including a number of EU member states, have laws of similar application, including anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws such as the UK Bribery Act. The UK Bribery Act prohibits giving, offering, or promising bribes to any person, as well as requesting, agreeing to receive, or accepting bribes from any person. Under the UK Bribery Act, a company that carries on a business or part of a business in the United Kingdom may be held liable for bribes given, offered or promised to any person in any country by employees or other persons associated with the company in order to obtain or retain business or a business advantage for the company. Liability under the UK Bribery Act is strict, but a defense of having in place adequate procedures designed to prevent bribery is available.
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In California the California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which went into effect on January 1, 2023, establishes a privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expansive definition of personal information, establishing data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California, imposing special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, and creating a potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. The CPRA also created a new state agency that is vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. While clinical trial data and information governed by HIPAA are currently exempt from the current version of the CCPA, other personal information may be applicable and possible changes to the CCPA may broaden its scope.
Certain other state laws impose similar privacy obligations, and we also anticipate that more states will increasingly enact legislation similar to the CCPA. The CCPA has prompted a number of proposals for new federal and state-level privacy legislation and in some states efforts to pass comprehensive privacy laws have been successful. For example, on January 1, 2023, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, or CDPA, became effective. Further, many additional US state privacy laws will go into effect throughout 2023: Colorado Privacy Act, or CPA (July 1, 2023); Connecticut Data Privacy Act, or CTDPA (July 1, 2023); Utah Consumer Privacy Act, or UCPA (December 31, 2023). The CDPA, CPA, CTDPA, and UCPA are substantially similar in scope and contain many of the same requirements and exceptions as the CCPA, including a general exemption for clinical trial data and information governed by HIPAA. However, each of these laws also contain additional requirements that may impose additional compliance obligations upon us. Additionally, any of these laws may broaden their scope in the future, and similar laws have been proposed on both a federal level and in more than half of the states in the U.S. The existence of comprehensive privacy laws in different states in the country, if enacted, will add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk, require additional investment of resources 

in compliance programs, impact strategies and the availability of previously useful data, and has resulted in and will result in increased compliance costs and/or changes in business practices and policies.
Many US states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. Several states now require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products in those states and to report gifts and payments to individual health care providers in those states. Some of these states also prohibit certain marketing-related activities including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain health care providers. In addition, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers, marketing expenditures, and drug pricing information. Certain state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. State laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. In addition, globally, many countries have enacted stringent privacy and data protection laws. In the event that we begin to conduct trials outside of the United States or otherwise process personal information in countries outside of the United States, we will have to implement a comprehensive compliance program to address these requirements.
In the United States, to help patients afford our products, we may utilize programs to assist them, including patient assistance programs and co-pay coupon programs for eligible patients. Government enforcement agencies have shown increased interest in pharmaceutical companies' product and patient assistance programs, including reimbursement support services, and a number of investigations into these programs have resulted in significant civil and criminal settlements. In addition, at least one insurer has directed its network pharmacies to no longer accept co-pay coupons for certain specialty drugs the insurer identified. Our co-pay coupon programs could become the target of similar insurer actions. In addition, in November 2013, the CMS issued guidance to the issuers of qualified health plans sold through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces encouraging such plans to reject patient cost-sharing support from third parties and indicating that the CMS intends to monitor the provision of such support and may take regulatory action to limit it in the future. CMS subsequently issued a rule requiring individual market qualified health plans to accept third-party premium and cost-sharing payments from certain government-related entities. 
In September 2014, the OIG of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS issued a Special Advisory Bulletin warning manufacturers that they may be subject to sanctions under the federal anti-kickback statute and/or civil monetary penalty laws if they do not take appropriate steps to exclude Part D beneficiaries from using co-pay coupons. Accordingly, companies exclude these Part D beneficiaries from using co-pay coupons. It is possible that changes in insurer policies regarding co-pay coupons and/or the introduction and enactment of new legislation or regulatory action could restrict or otherwise negatively affect these patient support programs, which could result in fewer patients using affected products, and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our sales, business, and financial condition.
Third party patient assistance programs that receive financial support from companies have become the subject of enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny. The OIG has established guidelines that suggest that it is lawful for pharmaceutical manufacturers to make donations to charitable organizations who provide co-pay assistance to Medicare patients, provided that such organizations, among other things, are bona fide charities, are entirely independent of and not controlled by the manufacturer, provide aid to applicants on a first-come basis according to consistent financial criteria and do not link aid to use of a donor's product. However, donations to patient assistance programs have received some negative publicity and have been the subject of multiple government enforcement actions, related to allegations regarding their use to promote branded pharmaceutical products over other less costly alternatives. Specifically, in recent years, there have been multiple settlements resulting out of government claims challenging the legality of their patient assistance programs under a variety of federal and state laws.
On December 2, 2020, the HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price 

reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between PBMs and manufacturers. Implementation of this change and new safe harbors for point-of-sale reductions in price for prescription pharmaceutical products and PBM service fees are currently under review by the current U.S. presidential administration and may be amended or repealed. Further, on December 31, 2020, CMS published a new rule, effective January 1, 2023, requiring manufacturers to ensure the full value of co-pay assistance is passed on to the patient or these dollars will count toward the Average Manufacturer Price and Best Price calculation of the drug ("Accumulator Rule"). On May 17, 2022, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granted the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America's (PhRMA) motion for summary judgement invalidating the Accumulator Rule. We cannot predict how the implementation of and any further changes to this rule will affect our business. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the current U.S. presidential administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the current U.S. presidential administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
Because of the breadth of these various healthcare and privacy laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Such a challenge could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event governmental authorities conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare and privacy laws and regulations, they may impose sanctions under these laws, which are potentially significant and may include civil monetary penalties, damages, exclusion of an entity or individual from participation in government health care programs, criminal fines and imprisonment, as well as the potential curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our financial condition and divert the attention of our management from operating our business.
Government Regulation Outside of the United States
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical studies and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, or CTA, much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. In the EU, for example, a CTA must be submitted for each clinical trial to each country’s national competent authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, the corresponding clinical study may proceed. In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which entered into application to replace Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC on January 31, 2022. The new Regulation, which will be directly applicable in all EU member states (meaning that no national implementing legislation in each EU member state is required), aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. The main characteristics of the Regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point through the Clinical Trials Information System, or CTIS; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts (Part I contains scientific and medicinal product documentation and Part II contains the national and patient-level documentation). Part I is assessed by a coordinated review by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned) of a draft report prepared by a Reference Member State. Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.

The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
To obtain regulatory approval of a medicinal product in the EU, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the EU, with the exception of, among other things, region-specific document requirements. Medicinal product candidates may only be commercialized after obtaining the marketing authorization application. A centralized marketing authorization is issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA, and is valid throughout the EU, and in the additional member states of the European Economic Area, or EEA (Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein). The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicinal products (gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines), and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions, and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.
Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of a marketing authorization application considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, it provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who make the final decision to grant a marketing authorization, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application under the accelerated assessment procedure is 150 days, excluding clock stops, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. 
The EU also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. For example, in the EU, upon receiving marketing authorization, innovative medicinal products generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator’s preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the innovative medicinal product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU during such eight-year period starting from the date of grant of the innovative medicinal product's marketing authorization. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity (and the grant of the relevant generic or biosimilar marketing authorization). The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to authorization, is held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Even if a product is considered to be an innovative medicinal product so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company may market another version of the product if such company obtained a marketing authorization based on a marketing authorization application with a complete, independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials. 
Products receiving orphan designation in the EU and being granted a marketing authorization for an orphan medicinal product can receive ten years of market exclusivity, during which time no similar medicinal product for the same indication may be placed on the market. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product 

containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the EU where the application for a marketing authorization includes the results of all studies conducted in accordance with an agreed pediatric investigation plan for pediatric studies. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications.
The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EU are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five (5) in ten thousand (10,000) persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) it is unlikely that the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify the necessary investment in its development; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan drug designation itself does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, a marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product for the same indication at any time if:
•the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;
•the marketing authorization holder of the authorized product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or
•the marketing authorization holder of the authorized product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
In the EU, the advertising and promotion of our products will also be subject to EU member states’ laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, as well as other EU member state legislation that may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products. These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s approved Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the medicinal product. The off-label promotion of medicinal products is prohibited in the EU. The applicable laws at the EU level and in the individual EU member states also prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicinal products. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the EU could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. These laws may further limit or restrict communications concerning the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may also impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
Failure to comply with the EU member state laws implementing the EU laws on medicinal products, and EU rules governing the promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, with the EU member state laws that apply to the promotion of medicinal products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the EU member state authorities (or in addition, in some member states, enforcement action from industry bodies or legal action from competitors), which may include any of the 

following: fines, imprisonment, orders forfeiting products or prohibiting or suspending their supply to the market, or requiring the manufacturer to issue public warnings, or to conduct a product recall.
The national laws of certain EU member states require payments made to physicians to be publicly disclosed. Moreover, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, or EFPIA, Code on disclosure of transfers of value from pharmaceutical companies to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations imposes a general obligation on members of the EFPIA or related national industry bodies to disclose transfers of value to healthcare professionals. In addition, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his/her competent professional organization, and/or the competent authorities of the individual EU member states. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU member states.
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA, which consists of the EU member states, plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Central and South America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. This act could have implications for our interactions with physicians in and outside the UK. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP, applicable regulatory requirements, and ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, warning letters or untitled letters, injunctions, civil, administrative, or criminal penalties, monetary fines or imprisonment, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, suspension of ongoing clinical studies, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us, suspension or the imposition of restrictions on operations, product recalls, the refusal to permit the import or export of our products or the seizure or detention of products.
Pricing, Coverage and Reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payers is critical to new product acceptance. Our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. If coverage and adequate reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment.
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the United States Department of Health and Human Services. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payers tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. However, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payers. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payer to payer. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the drug product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Third-party payers may provide coverage, but place stringent limitations on such coverage, such as requiring alternative treatments to be tried first. These third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, 

in addition to their safety, efficacy, and overall value. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to incurring the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically reasonable or necessary or cost-effective. Factors payors consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is:
•a covered benefit under its health plan; 
•safe, effective and medically necessary; 
•appropriate for the specific patient; 
•cost-effective; and 
•neither experimental nor investigational.
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of drug products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate systems under which products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of studies or analyses of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to set their own prices for medicines, but exert cost controls in other ways, including but not limited to, placing revenue caps on product sales, providing reimbursement for only a subset of eligible patients, mandating price negotiations after a set period of time, or mandating that prices not exceed an average basket of prices in other countries. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly treatments, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, European governments may periodically review and decrease prices based on factors, including but not limited to, years-on-market, price in other countries, competitive entry, new clinical data, lack of supporting clinical data, or other factors.
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, the emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to exert downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and pharmaceutical pricing regulations may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Healthcare Reform
Payers, whether domestic or foreign, or governmental or private, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs and those methods are not always specifically adapted for new technologies such as gene therapy and therapies addressing rare diseases such as those we are developing. In both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the health care system that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. In particular, in 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, was enacted, which, among other things, subjected biologic products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars; increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs; created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under 

Medicare Part D; and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research.
In addition, other legislative and regulatory changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted:
•The U.S. Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. Subsequent legislation extended the 2% payment reduction which remains in effect through 2030.
•On January 2, 2013, the U.S. American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers.
•On April 13, 2017, CMS published a final rule that gives states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.
•On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. 
•On May 23, 2019, CMS published a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020.
Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. Specifically, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, and review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs. President Biden has issued multiple executive orders that have sought to reduce prescription drug costs. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, includes several provisions that may impact our business to varying degrees, including provisions that reduce the out-of-pocket cap for Medicare Part D beneficiaries to $2,000 starting in 2025; impose new manufacturer financial liability on certain drugs under Medicare Part D, allow the U.S. government to negotiate Medicare Part B and Part D price caps for certain high-cost drugs and biologics without generic or biosimilar competition, require companies to pay rebates to Medicare for certain drug prices that increase faster than inflation, and delay the rebate rule that would limit the fees that pharmacy benefit managers can charge. Further, under the IRA, orphan drugs are exempted from the Medicare drug price negotiation program, but only if they have one rare disease designation and for which the only approved indication is for that disease or condition. If a product receives multiple rare disease designations or has multiple approved indications, it may not qualify for the orphan drug exemption. The effects of the IRA on our business and the healthcare industry in general is not yet known.
Federal, state and local governments in the United States and foreign governments continue to consider other legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Specifically, there have been several recent United States Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.

In addition, there have been several changes to the 340B drug pricing program, which imposes ceilings on prices that drug manufacturers can charge for medications sold to certain health care facilities. On December 27, 2018, the District Court for the District of Columbia invalidated a reimbursement formula change under the 340B drug pricing program, and CMS subsequently altered the FYs 2019 and 2018 reimbursement formula on specified covered outpatient drugs (“SCODs”). The court ruled this change was not an “adjustment” which was within the Secretary’s discretion to make but was instead a fundamental change in the reimbursement calculation. However, most recently, on July 31, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned the district court’s decision and found that the changes were within the Secretary’s authority. On September 14, 2020, the plaintiffs-appellees filed a Petition for Rehearing En Banc (i.e., before the full court), but was denied on October 16, 2020. Plaintiffs-appellees filed a petition for a writ of certiorari at the Supreme Court on February 10, 2021. On June 15, 2022, the Supreme Court unanimously reversed the Court of Appeals’ decision, holding that HHS’s 2018 and 2019 reimbursement rates for 340B hospitals were contrary to the statute and unlawful. We continue to review developments impacting the 340B program.
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
Human Capital Resources
As of February 1, 2023, we employ approximately 425 full-time employees, 97 of whom hold M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. To allow us flexibility in meeting varying workflow demands, we also engage consultants and temporary workers when needed. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a trade or labor union. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Compensation and benefits programs
Our compensation programs are designed to align our employees' interests with the drivers of growth and stockholder returns by supporting our achievement of its primary business goals. Our goal is to attract and retain employees whose talents, expertise, leadership, and contributions are expected to sustain growth and drive long-term stockholder value. We are committed to providing comprehensive benefit options and it is our intention to offer benefits that will allow our employees and their families to live healthier and more secure lives, with a focus on both physical and mental well-being. All full-time employees are eligible for medical, dental, and vision insurance, paid time off, paid and unpaid leaves, an employee stock purchase plan, a 401(k) plan, and group life and disability coverage.
Employee development and training
The development, recruitment and retention of our employees is a critical success factor for our company. To ensure we provide a meaningful experience for our employees, we intend to offer training and development programs to increase our organizational learning and support the promotion and career development of our current employees.
Diversity
At 2seventy bio, we believe that it’s about time that Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging become more than words. It is the core practice we are driven by in all we create. From our focus on patients, to how we are building our business and our culture, we believe diversity and belonging empower us to change the way we think, teach, and learn — from each other and about each other. Our mission is rooted in the belief that our cumulative and unique differences enable us to become better — better at our development of revolutionary scientific advancements and how we advance health equity by addressing cancer disparities with a goal of creating transformative treatments for those who need them. We strive to build an environment where we will deliver our best — that means having the 

hard conversations and doing the hard work — so we can all be unencumbered and inspired to celebrate who we are fully as human beings.
