ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of products that target markets with underserved patient populations in the ocular medicine and medical aesthetics therapeutic areas. In July 2020, we received regulatory approval from the FDA for RVL-1201, or Upneeq, (oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution), 0.1%, for the treatment of acquired blepharoptosis, or droopy or low-lying eyelids in adults. We believe Upneeq is the first non-surgical treatment option approved by the FDA for acquired blepharoptosis. We launched Upneeq in September 2020 to a limited number of eye care professionals with commercial operations expanded in 2021 among ophthalmology, optometry and oculoplastic specialties. In February 2022, Upneeq was commercially expanded into the medical aesthetics market in the United States. Patients may purchase Upneeq either from eye care or medical aesthetic professionals, or exclusively through RVL Pharmacy, LLC, our wholly-owned pharmacy.

We acquired the worldwide rights to RVL-1201 in 2017 in exchange for an upfront cash payment plus the obligation to make additional payments consisting of future earn-out payments to the sellers of RevitaLid based on net sales of Upneeq. In addition, we are required to make milestone payments based on regulatory and sales milestones and to pay royalties to VOOM, LLC in connection with the license for Upneeq that we acquired as part of the acquisition of RVL-1201. 
​
Upneeq is manufactured and supplied to us by Nephron Pharmaceuticals Corporation under an exclusive supply agreement that has a term of five years from the production of the initial commercial batches, which occurred in July 2020 and automatically renews for additional one-year periods unless either party provides at least 90 days advance written notice of non-renewal.
​
On July 28, 2020, we entered into a license agreement with Santen Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd (“Santen”), granting Santen exclusive development, registration, and commercialization rights to RVL-1201 in Japan, China, and other Asian countries as well as Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) countries (the “License Agreement”). Santen is responsible for further development of RVL-1201 in the licensed territories. Under the License Agreement, we have received an upfront payment of $25.0 million in 2020 and a license milestone payment of $10.0 million in 2021. On March 29, 2022, we amended the License Agreement, effective March 31, 2022 (as amended, the “Amended License Agreement”), and received $15.5 million to expand the licensed territories to include certain additional EMEA countries and Canada and remove certain regulatory approval milestones from the License Agreement. Under the Amended License Agreement, we may receive additional payments of up to $31.0 million based on development, regulatory and sales milestone payments in Santen’s territories. We are also entitled to royalty payments on net sales of RVL-1201 in Santen commercialization territories. See Note 5, “Revenues,” of our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our License Agreement with Santen.
​
On August 27, 2021, we announced the closing of the divestiture of our portfolio of branded and non-promoted products and our Marietta, Georgia, manufacturing facility (collectively, the “Legacy Business”), to certain affiliates of Alora Pharmaceuticals, LLC (“Alora”) for $111 million in cash upon closing, subject to certain post-closing adjustments, and up to $60 million in contingent milestone payments. Pursuant to the divestiture, we retained the rights to Upneeq and to arbaclofen extended release (“ER”) tablets, which is under development for the treatment of spasticity in multiple sclerosis. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we received an aggregate of $5.0 million in cash from Alora related to contingent milestone payments earned in connection with the sale of the Legacy Business.
With the divestiture of the Legacy Business, our commercial operations are conducted by our wholly-owned subsidiary, RVL Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its subsidiary RVL Pharmacy, LLC (“RVL Pharmacy”). RVL Pharmacy exclusively conducts pharmacy operations dedicated to the processing and fulfillment of prescriptions for Upneeq.
​
Following the divestiture of the Legacy Business, we are exploring opportunities to sell or out-license our late-stage product candidate arbaclofen ER tablets designed for the alleviation of signs and symptoms of spasticity resulting from multiple sclerosis for which we have completed Phase III clinical trials. In June 2020, we resubmitted our NDA for arbaclofen ER tablets to the FDA. On July 17, 2020, we received notice from the FDA that it considered the resubmission a complete response to the July 9, 2016 action letter and set a goal date for a FDA decision on the NDA of December 29, 2020. On December 28, 2020, we received a complete response letter (“CRL”) indicating the FDA could not approve the NDA in its then current form. The CRL stated that we did not provide adequate justification (including in our most recent NDA amendment) for the statistical analysis of the change from baseline to Day 84 in the Total Numeric-transformed Ashworth Scale in the most affected limb (“TNmAS-MAL”) scores comparing arbaclofen ER 40 mg to placebo, one of the co-primary endpoints. On January 23, 2021, we submitted a Type A meeting request to the FDA to discuss the CRL’s recommendations and obtain advice on a path forward for the NDA. The meeting took place on March 4, 2021, during which we explored selective review of the currently available data and options for a path forward for FDA approval, including conducting another clinical study. On August 2, 2021, we submitted a special protocol assessment (“SPA”) to the FDA proposing an additional clinical study for arbaclofen ER. The FDA responded in a letter dated October 15, 2021, indicating that they are unable to issue an agreement on the submitted protocol. On October 10, 2022, we resubmitted a SPA and on November 24, 2022, we received a letter from the FDA indicating that they were unable to issue an agreement on the SPA. On February 8, 2023, we resubmitted a SPA with a revised study protocol and statistical analysis.

Our Market
Our healthcare provider customers include optometrists, ophthalmologists, oculoplastic surgeons, facial plastic surgeons, dermatologists, and practitioners qualified to diagnose and treat acquired blepharoptosis, or droopy or low-lying eyelids, in adults. Our target patient population comprises adults with droopy or low-lying eyelids or acquired ptosis, the majority of which are female. While the exact prevalence of acquired ptosis is unknown, we believe it to be a common age-related condition. A survey of eye care providers and medical aesthetics specialists suggests that approximately half of adult patients visiting these specialties may be affected by droopy or low-lying eyelids. Further, we estimate that approximately 60% of adult women self-identify as having some degree of droopy or low-lying eyelids and a majority of those women indicate that they are bothered by the position of their eyelids.  
​
The global medical aesthetics market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of over 10% and reach $18 billion in 2027, with North America representing the largest share of the global market. Similarly, the global eye care market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of over 6% through 2026 and reach $86 billion. An estimated 100 million adults visit an eye care provider each year in the United States alone. 
​
We believe the growth in medical aesthetics and eye care markets will be driven by a number of factors, including:

● | an aging population together with an increasing life expectancy, which is resulting in more consumers with a desire for improved appearance and well-being over a longer period of time;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | rising disposable income, with the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis reporting that real disposable income in the United States increased approximately 21% from December 2012 to December 2020;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | growing awareness, utilization and acceptance of elective or minimally invasive and non-invasive interventions; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | continued innovation and improved accessibility to treatments due to an increase in the number of physicians who offer eye care and medical aesthetics services.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Our Strategy
Our goal is to become a growth company in the fields of ocular medicine and medical aesthetics. To accomplish this goal, we intend to:
​
Establish Upneeq as the First-line Treatment Option for Acquired Ptosis and Continue to Grow Sales. Upneeq is the first and only non-surgical FDA-approved treatment option for acquired ptosis in adults. We believe that there is a significant commercial opportunity for Upneeq given the meaningful unmet need for a non-invasive treatment across millions of acquired ptosis patients in the United States. Our near-term focus is to continue the rollout of Upneeq into the medical aesthetics market through our dedicated aesthetics sales force, while continuing to support ongoing utilization and expanded penetration of Upneeq in ocular medicine markets. While promotion of the product currently relies heavily on our sales force engaging medical aesthetic practices, we continue to raise patient and physician awareness of acquired ptosis and Upneeq through traditional advertising, medical conferences, social media (e.g., Facebook and Instagram) and marketing partnerships. 
Broaden Distribution Channels for Upneeq. Following FDA approval in July 2020, we launched Upneeq in eye care specialties and made the product exclusively available through prescription at our wholly-owned and operated pharmacy, RVL Pharmacy. While RVL Pharmacy remains the exclusive point of pharmacy fulfillment for Upneeq, we have also added additional means of access to the product for patients. In September 2021, we initiated the Direct Dispense program to eye care professionals and in early 2022 to medical aesthetics professionals. Under the program we sell Upneeq directly to eye care professionals and medical aesthetics practices where the practice is then able to resell and dispense Upneeq to appropriate patients. To address certain instances where an eye care professional or medical aesthetics practice may be unable to dispense a pharmaceutical product from his or her practice, in January 2022, we initiated the Virtual Inventory program where Upneeq is dispensed and furnished to patients by RVL Pharmacy pursuant to a prescription, after the product is sold to eye care professionals or medical aesthetics practices for resale to patients. 

6



In 2022 we started supplying Upneeq to certain telemedicine providers with established channels to diagnose patients online and prescribe and ship directly to appropriate patients. 
Continue to Divest Non-Core Assets. Following the sale of our Legacy Business in 2021, the Company is looking to continue monetizing non-core assets to fully focus resources on growing Upneeq. We consider our late stage product candidate, arbaclofen ER, a treatment for spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis, to be a non-strategic asset and the Company is seeking to either sell the asset or find a license partner to complete development and commercialize the product.
Leverage our pharmacy infrastructure. We consider RVL’s pharmacy operations to be a key strategic asset for the Company where we may look to opportunistically acquire or in-license rights to clinically differentiated products or product candidates suitable to our unique pharmacy distribution channel and self-pay healthcare marketplace. Our management team has a history of successfully executing and integrating product and company acquisitions, which we believe positions us to capitalize on these opportunities.
Our Portfolio
Upneeq (RVL-1201) for Acquired Blepharoptosis in Adults
​
We are focused on growing Upneeq with eye care and medical aesthetic professionals and providing a convenient prescription experience for patients through our pharmacy. RVL Pharmacy dispenses Upneeq only and operates only on a cash basis (i.e., it does not submit any claims to third party payors for prescriptions filled). As the first pharmacological treatment for acquired blepharoptosis approved by the FDA in the United States, we believe Upneeq represents an important therapy in the continuum of care for adult patients with acquired blepharoptosis.
​
Blepharoptosis, or ptosis, may be present at birth, called congenital blepharoptosis, or acquired over time due to age or illness, called acquired blepharoptosis. Ptosis manifests itself as mild, moderate or severe and can look like the following:
​
​
According to a 2018 survey of U.S. optometrists, ophthalmologists and surgeons, approximately 38% of blepharoptosis cases were mild and 48% were moderate. While no robust epidemiological studies exploring the prevalence of blepharoptosis exist, we believe it is a condition affecting millions of Americans. A study conducted in 1995 in the United Kingdom found some level of blepharoptosis in 12% of a sample set of adults age 50 years and older and that 90% of the sample had acquired blepharoptosis after birth.
​
Medical research has shown that eyelid droop can cause pupil obstruction and deficits in patients’ superior visual field. Additionally, blepharoptosis can lead to an asymmetric eye appearance or sleepy look which in turn can lead to increased appearance related distress, anxiety and depression, similar to patients with other appearance-altering ocular conditions. A Company sponsored survey conducted in 2021 (n=149) indicated health care providers estimate prevalence of blepharoptosis among their patient population to range from 42% to 62%. Additionally, consumer interest in eyelid position is high. In a market research report we commissioned in 2021 among 10,000 women aged 20-70 with household incomes greater than $50,000, more than 60% of participants identified as having at least one droopy or low-lying eyelid. Of those who identified as having droopy or low-lying eyelid(s), approximately 29% indicated an interest in purchasing Upneeq, if prescribed.

We acquired the worldwide rights to RVL-1201 in 2017 in exchange for an upfront cash payment plus the obligation to make additional payments based on our net sales of the product. RVL-1201 is manufactured and supplied to us by Nephron Pharmaceuticals Corporation under an exclusive supply agreement that has a term of five years from the production of the initial commercial batches, which occurred in July 2020 and automatically renews for additional one-year periods unless either party provides at least 90 days advance written notice of non-renewal. Remaining milestone payments in an aggregate amount of up to $0.8 million could become payable by us upon the achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones.
​
Results from the first Phase III clinical trial of RVL-1201 demonstrated that the formulation met its primary efficacy endpoint and was well-tolerated. The 2:1 randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study comprised 140 patients with blepharoptosis in two treatment groups for 42 days. Patients treated with RVL-1201 received one full drop in each eye each morning while patients treated with the placebo also received one full drop in each eye each morning. The primary efficacy endpoints were change in baseline visual field using the Leicester Peripheral Field Test or LPFT, on Hour 6 Day 1 (p=0.0003) and Hour 2 on Day 14 (p< 0.0001). As shown below, patients who received RVL-1201 once-daily experienced a statistically significant improvement in visual field when compared to the placebo group.
​
​
RVL-1201 Phase III Clinical Trial Efficacy: Leicester Peripheral Field Test (LPFT)
(Intent-to-Treat Population)
​
​
RVL-1201 was generally well tolerated by patients in this clinical trial when administered once daily over a 6-week period. There were no serious adverse events identified from treatment with RVL-1201 in this Phase III clinical trial.
​
The second Phase III trial was a six-week randomized, multicenter, double-masked, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of once-daily treatment of RVL-1201 compared with placebo for the treatment of acquired blepharoptosis. The primary endpoint was a measurement of the mean change from baseline of the number of points seen out of a total of 35 in the top four rows of the LPFT as measured in two time points: hour 6 on day 1 and hour two on day 14. The secondary endpoint was a measurement of the distance between the center of the pupillary light reflex and the upper eyelid margin, or MRD-1. Topline results from the second Phase III trial showed that the trial met both the primary and secondary endpoints. The mean change from baseline on the LPFT on hour 6, day 1 was 6.3 for RVL-1201 versus 2.1 for vehicle (p < 0.0001) and on hour two, day 14 was 7.7 for RVL-1201 versus 2.4 for vehicle (p < 0.0001). The results also showed a statistically significant improvement in MRD-1 at 5 and 15 minutes, and 2 and 6 hours post dose on days 1 and 14. We also completed a 12-week randomized, multicenter, double-masked, placebo-controlled safety study to evaluate the safety of RVL-1201 compared with vehicle for the treatment of acquired blepharoptosis. Results of the safety study showed RVL-1201 was well tolerated when administered once daily over a 12-week period

where the majority of adverse events were mild and did not require treatment. On July 8, 2020, the FDA approved Upneeq for the treatment of acquired blepharoptosis, or droopy or low-lying eyelids, in adults.
​
Arbaclofen ER for the Alleviation of Spasticity in Multiple Sclerosis Patients
​
We are also developing arbaclofen ER tablets. Baclofen is the only FDA-approved product that targets the GABA b receptor to treat spasticity. Baclofen is a racemic mixture comprised of an R and an S-isomer. The R-isomer of baclofen, or arbaclofen, has been shown in vivo to be up to 100 times more effective at targeting the GABA b receptor than the S-isomer. We developed our product candidate arbaclofen ER using our proprietary Osmodex drug delivery system for the treatment of spasticity in multiple sclerosis patients. Arbaclofen ER has received orphan drug designation by the FDA in this indication, and we have patent coverage for arbaclofen ER extending to 2036.
​
In June 2020, we amended our NDA, which had been previously submitted in 2015, for arbaclofen ER tablets for the alleviation of spasticity in multiple sclerosis to the FDA. On July 17, 2020, we received notice from the FDA that it considered the amendment a complete response to the July 9, 2016 action letter and set a goal date for a FDA decision on the NDA of December 29, 2020. On December 28, 2020, we received a CRL indicating the FDA could not approve the NDA in its then current form. The CRL stated that we did not provide adequate justification (including in our most recent NDA amendment) for the statistical analysis of the change from baseline to Day 84 in TNmAS-MAL scores comparing arbaclofen ER 40 mg to placebo, one of the co-primary endpoints. On January 23, 2021, we submitted a Type A meeting request to the FDA to discuss the CRL’s recommendations and obtain advice on a path forward for the NDA. The meeting took place on March 4, 2021, during which we explored selective review of the currently available data and options for a path forward for FDA approval, including conducting another clinical study. On August 2, 2021, we submitted a SPA to the FDA proposing an additional clinical study for arbaclofen ER. FDA responded in a letter dated October 15, 2021, indicating that they are unable to issue an agreement on the submitted protocol. On October 10, 2022, we resubmitted a SPA and on November 24, 2022, we received a letter from the FDA indicating that they were unable to issue an agreement on the SPA. On February 8, 2023, we resubmitted a SPA with a revised study protocol and statistical analysis. If we are required to conduct any additional clinical trials for arbaclofen ER, our development costs will increase, our regulatory approval process could be delayed or denied and we may not be able to find a third party to license or acquire arbaclofen ER in the timeframe currently contemplated, if at all.
​
Intellectual Property
We have built and continue to develop our intellectual property portfolio for Upneeq and arbaclofen ER. We rely on our substantial know-how, technological innovation, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, other intellectual property and in-licensing opportunities to maintain and develop our competitive position. We pursue patent protection in the United States and selected international markets. As of December 31, 2022, we owned or had license rights to 25 U.S. patents, 50 patents outside the United States and 28 pending patent applications, the last of which expires in 2039.
Upneeq benefits from substantial intellectual property. Upon approval, Upneeq received three years of data exclusivity from the FDA that expires on July 8, 2023. Additionally, the patent portfolio protecting Upneeq consists of both issued method of use patents expiring in 2031 and formulation patents expiring in 2039. Internationally, Upneeq has intellectual property protection granted or pending in most major markets in North and South America, Asia and Europe. 
Competition
​
We believe Upneeq enjoys certain market benefits including the distribution channels through which patients access the product. Unlike most other pharmaceutical products, Upneeq is not distributed and dispensed by national pharmacy chains but is sold and dispensed directly to patients through our wholly owned pharmacy. Accordingly, in the event a generic equivalent to Upneeq were to be approved by the FDA, there is no retail pharmacy where the drug can be automatically substituted for a generic equivalent. Nevertheless, the pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We may face competition from various eye care, medical aesthetics and generic drug companies that engage in drug development activities. Many of our competitors have greater financial flexibility to deploy capital in certain areas as well as more commercial and other resources, marketing and manufacturing organizations, and larger research and development staff. As a result, these companies may be able to 

9



pursue strategies or approvals that we are not able to finance or otherwise pursue and may receive FDA, European Medicines Agency or other applicable regulatory approvals more efficiently or rapidly than us. Also, our competitors may have more experience in marketing and selling their products post approval and gaining market acceptance more quickly. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Upneeq could become less competitive if our competitors are able to license or acquire technology that is more effective or less costly and thereby offer an improved or a cheaper alternative to Upneeq. We also expect to face competition in our efforts to identify appropriate collaborators or partners to help commercialize Upneeq in our target commercial markets.
Government Regulation and Approval Process
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level, including the FDA, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of drug products such as Upneeq and arbaclofen ER. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can, among other things, result in suspension of regulatory approval and possible civil and criminal sanctions. Regulations, enforcement positions, statutes and legal interpretations applicable to the pharmaceutical industry are constantly evolving and are not always clear. Significant changes in regulations, enforcement positions, statutes and legal interpretations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Additionally, future healthcare legislation or other legislative proposals at the federal and state levels could bring about major changes in the affected health care systems. We cannot predict the outcome of such initiatives, but such initiatives, if passed, could result in significant costs to us in terms of costs of compliance and penalties associated with failure to comply.
Pharmaceutical Regulation in the United States
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, Warning Letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug can be marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a new drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves:

● | completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s current good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with current good clinical practice, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each intended use;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------

10




● | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with the FDA’s Current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, regulations to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of a potential review by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

Once a product candidate is identified for development, the first step in proceeding to clinical studies is preclinical testing. Preclinical tests include laboratory study evaluations of the product to determine its chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies to evaluate the potential for efficacy and toxicity. Toxicology studies are also performed to assess the potential safety of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLPs. The results of these studies are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to one or more proposed clinical trials, including concerns that human research subjects are or would be exposed to an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury, and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent IRB must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and informed consent information for subjects before the trial commences and it must monitor the study until completed.
Clinical trials involve the administration of a drug product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified medical investigators. Clinical trials are conducted according to study protocols that detail the objectives of the study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor participant safety, and these study protocols must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must also comply with extensive GCP requirements, including requirements related to informed consent. 
The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial or impose other conditions at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or for failure to comply with GCP or the IRB’s requirements. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

● | Phase I: In Phase I, through the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human volunteers or patients, the drug is tested to assess absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination, pharmacokinetics and safety.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase II: Phase II usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase III: Phase III clinical trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase III clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase III clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances, for example, where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.

After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include, among other things, the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer or sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual program fees. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to payment of additional user fees. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs through a two-tiered classification system, Standard Review and Priority Review. Priority Review designation is given to drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness over existing therapies. The FDA endeavors to review most applications subject to Standard Review within ten months whereas the FDA’s goal is to review most Priority Review applications within six months.
The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the NDA unless it determines that the manufacturing process and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective for the labeled indication.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter, which authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications, or a complete response letter to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that an application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If, or when, the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. 
As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. If the FDA determines a REMS is necessary during review of the application, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug’s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other elements to assure safe use, such as special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to periodically assess the strategy. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a drug.
Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy, and the FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or certain problems are identified following initial marketing. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling, and, even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product or impose other conditions, including labeling or distribution restrictions or other risk-management mechanisms.

12



Further changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the similar procedures in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
Sponsors of certain clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on www.ClinicalTrials.gov. Information related to the product, subject population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss certain results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
Post-Approval Requirements
Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to drug listing and registration, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, adverse event reporting and advertising, marketing and promotion, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Drugs such as Upneeq may be marketed only for the approved indications and in a manner consistent with the provisions of the approved labeling. While physicians may prescribe for off-label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. If a company, including any agent of the company or anyone speaking on behalf of the company, is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses, the company may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the DOJ, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. 
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports and promotional material is also required following FDA approval of an NDA. Additionally, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase IV testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to comply with cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments and list their marketed products with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls based on the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or the failure to comply with regulatory standards. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drug’s benefits outweigh its risks. In addition, regulatory authorities may take other enforcement action, including, among other things, Warning Letters, the seizure of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, clinical trial holds, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.

The Hatch-Waxman Amendments
505(b)(2) NDAs
We submitted our NDA for arbaclofen ER under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference from the data owner. The applicant may rely upon the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy for an approved product that acts as the “listed drug.” The FDA may also require 505(b)(2) applicants to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the listed drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the conditions of use for which the branded reference drug has been approved, or for a new condition of use sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.
The number and size of studies that need to be conducted by the sponsor depends on the amount and quality of data pertaining to the reference drug that are publicly available, and on the similarity of and differences between the applicant’s drug and the reference drug. Additionally, all development, process, stability, qualification and validation data related to the manufacturing and quality of the new product must be included in the 505(b)(2) NDA. In some cases, extensive, time-consuming, and costly clinical and nonclinical studies may still be required for approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA.
​
Orange Book Listing
​
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Upneeq, for example, as of December 31, 2022, had ten patents listed in the FDA Orange Book. Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA (i) that there is no patent listed with the FDA as covering the relevant branded product, (ii) that any patent listed as covering the branded product has expired, (iii) that the patent listed as covering the branded product will expire prior to the marketing of the generic product, in which case the ANDA will not be finally approved by the FDA until the expiration of such patent or (iv) that any patent listed as covering the branded drug is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, sale or use of the generic product for which the ANDA is submitted. A notice of the Paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii” statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.
If the reference NDA holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the Paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the Paragraph IV certification, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired as described in further detail below.
Non-Patent Exclusivity
In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug.
For example, for listed drugs that were considered new chemical entities at the time of approval, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application referencing that drug may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years after approval of that drug, unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval.
A drug, including one approved under Section 505(b)(2), may obtain a three-year period of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if 

14



one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. Upneeq, for example, was afforded three years of exclusivity through July 8, 2023. In addition, drugs approved for diseases for which the patient population is sufficiently small, or orphan indications, are entitled to a seven-year data exclusivity period.
Orphan Drugs
Arbaclofen ER has received Orphan Drug Designation for the alleviation of signs and symptoms of spasticity resulting from multiple sclerosis.
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which means a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug available in the United States will be recovered from domestic sales of the product. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA, and both the drug and the disease or condition must meet certain criteria specified in the Orphan Drug Act and FDA’s implementing regulations at 21 C.F.R. Part 316. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
Orphan drug designation entitles the applicant to incentives such as grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages, and waivers of FDA user fees. In addition, if a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is also entitled to seven years of orphan drug exclusivity. During the seven-year marketing exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process and a subsequent grant of orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States, federal and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation or take administrative action designed to reform the health care system, which include initiatives to reduce the cost of health care. Pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement has been a focus of such efforts. Continued health care reform efforts are likely. The nature and scope of such efforts cannot be predicted. Additionally, although Upneeq is not currently covered by any private or government insurance, we cannot predict if Upneeq may be covered in the future, or the future effect such reforms may have on our business. No assurance can therefore be given that any such reforms will not have a material adverse effect. See “Risk Factors – Risks related to our industry.”
Healthcare Regulations
In the United States, our business activities are subject to numerous other federal, state and local laws designed to, for example, prevent fraud and abuse; promote transparency in interactions with others in the healthcare industry; and protect the privacy of individual information. These laws are enforced by various federal and state enforcement authorities, including but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Justice, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, HHS’ various divisions, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, and the Office of Inspector General, and state boards of pharmacy.
We may be subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws, and false claims laws, for activities related to past and future sales of any products reimbursable by third party payors such as federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) or, in some cases, commercial health plans. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a pharmaceutical manufacturer from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration to generate business, including the purchase, prescription or use of a particular drug. False 

15



claims laws generally prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, any claims for payment for reimbursed drugs or services to third-party payors that are false or fraudulent. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to particular industry practices. There is therefore a possibility that our practices might be challenged under such laws.
Laws and regulations have also been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers with marketed products. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers; require manufacturers to adopt certain compliance standard; require disclosure to the government and public of such interactions; require disclosure of marketing expenditures or pricing information; regulate drug pricing and/or require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, any future activities (if we obtain approval and/or reimbursement from federal healthcare programs for our product candidates) could be subject to challenge.
The FDA regulates the sale and marketing of prescription drug products and, among other things, prohibits pharmaceutical manufacturers from making false or misleading statements and from promoting products for unapproved uses.
We may be subject to data privacy and security laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, obtain or store personally identifiable information. Numerous U.S. federal and state laws govern the collection, use, disclosure and storage of personal information. Various foreign countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use, disclosure and storage of personal information. Globally, there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues that may affect our business. See “Risk Factors - Risks related to our industry.”
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above, or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 
State Price Reporting
Several states have implemented regulations around price transparency and are requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to register and report a drug’s wholesale acquisition cost, or WAC, and any increase in a drug’s WAC price. We may or may not be subject to these regulations and cannot predict how many additional states will enact similar regulations or how these regulations will change in the future. If we are required to register and submit information and fail to do so, we may be subject to fines and other penalties for non-compliance.
Drug Pedigree Laws
State and federal governments have proposed or passed various drug pedigree laws which can require the tracking of all transactions involving prescription drugs from the manufacturer to the pharmacy (or other dispensing) level. Companies are required to maintain records documenting the chain of custody of prescription drug products beginning with the purchase of such products from the manufacturer. Compliance with these pedigree laws requires implementation of extensive tracking systems as well as heightened documentation and coordination with customers and manufacturers. While we fully intend to comply with these laws, there is uncertainty about future changes in legislation and government enforcement of these laws. Failure to comply could result in fines or penalties, as well as loss of business that could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.

Federal Regulation of Patent Litigation Settlements and Authorized Generic Arrangements
As part of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, companies are required to file with the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and DOJ certain types of agreements entered into between brand and generic pharmaceutical companies related to the settlement of patent litigation or manufacture, marketing and sale of generic versions of branded drugs. This requirement could affect the manner in which generic drug manufacturers resolve intellectual property litigation and other disputes with brand pharmaceutical companies, and could result generally in an increase in private-party litigation against pharmaceutical companies or additional investigations or proceedings by the FTC or other governmental authorities.
Other
The U.S. federal government, various states and localities have laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of pharmaceuticals, as well as regulations dealing with the substitution of generic drugs for branded drugs. Our operations are also subject to regulation, licensing requirements and inspection by the states and localities in which our operations are located or in which we conduct business.
Certain of our activities are also subject to FTC enforcement actions. The FTC also enforces a variety of antitrust and consumer protection laws designed to ensure that the nation’s markets function competitively, are vigorous, efficient and free of undue restrictions. Federal, state, local and foreign laws of general applicability, such as laws regulating working conditions, also govern us.
In addition, we are subject to numerous and increasingly stringent federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and the cleanup of contamination. We are required to maintain and comply with environmental permits and controls for some of our operations, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by the issuing authorities. Our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future as a result of changes in environmental laws and regulations or increased manufacturing activities at any of our facilities. We could incur significant costs or liabilities as a result of any failure to comply with environmental laws, including fines, penalties, third-party claims and the costs of undertaking a clean-up at a current or former site or at a site to which our wastes were transported. In addition, we have grown in part by acquisition, and our diligence may not have identified environmental impacts from historical operations at sites we have acquired in the past or may acquire in the future.
