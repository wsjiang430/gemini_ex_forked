Overview
Our Company
We are a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of innovative therapeutics for the treatment of seizure disorders, including rare genetic epilepsies and status epilepticus. On March 18, 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved our new drug application (NDA) for the use of ZTALMY (ganaxolone) oral suspension for the treatment of seizures associated with Cyclin-dependent Kinase-like 5 Deficiency Disorder (CDD) in patients 2 years of age and older. In June 2022, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) published an interim final rule in the Federal Register placing ganaxolone and its salts in schedule V (CV) of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), which rule became final on December 9, 2022. ZTALMY, our first FDA approved product, became available for commercial sale and shipment to patients with a prescription in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2022. We plan to develop ganaxolone for the treatment of other rare genetic epilepsies, including Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), and for the treatment of status epilepticus (SE). We are developing ganaxolone in formulations for two different routes of administration: intravenous (IV) and oral. The different formulations are intended to maximize potential therapeutic applications of ganaxolone for adult and pediatric patient populations, in both acute and chronic care, and for both in-patient and self-administered settings. While the precise mechanism by which ganaxolone exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of seizures associated with CDD is unknown, its anticonvulsant effects are thought to result from positive allosteric modulation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor in the central nervous system (CNS). Ganaxolone is a synthetic analog of allopregnanolone, an endogenous neurosteroid. Ganaxolone acts at both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors, a target known for its anti-seizure, antidepressant and anxiolytic potential.
​
Our Strategy 
Our mission is to maximize the value of ganaxolone as a best-in-class therapy for rare seizure and neurological disorders through development of multiple formulations for oral and IV administration. The key elements of our strategy include the following:

● | Pursuing orphan, genetic epilepsy indications for ganaxolone. Within epilepsy, there are several disorders where the symptoms have been linked to deficits in GABAergic signaling. Based on our clinical data, we believe that increasing activation of GABA receptors and associated processes (GABAergic tone) with ganaxolone could provide therapeutic benefits and that treatments for these small populations have the potential for more efficient paths through clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization. In addition to CDD and TSC, we may in the future develop ganaxolone in one or more additional indications for rare epilepsies. We may also seek to in-license complementary products to leverage our development and commercial investment.

● | Pursuing hospital-based orphan indications for ganaxolone. We believe that hospitalized SE patients who do not respond to available first- and second-line treatments are significantly underserved with severely limited treatment options. Additionally, SE is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Due to its activity at extrasynaptic GABAA receptors, ganaxolone may provide a therapeutic benefit for patients whose SE is refractory to currently available first- and second-line treatments. To that end, and based on our Phase 2 trial results, we are conducting the Randomized Therapy In Status Epilepticus trial (RAISE trial), a pivotal Phase 3 trial in refractory status epilepticus (RSE) patients. We are also conducting

the Researching Established Status Epileptics Treatment Trial, or the RESET trial, a Phase 2 trial in established status epileptics (ESE), and may in the future study similar and other hospital-based indications that could benefit from ganaxolone’s mechanism of action.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reformulation and prodrug compounds. We intend to further develop the current oral formulation of ganaxolone through second-generation reformulation and prodrug compounds. A reformulation or prodrug of ganaxolone that increases bioavailability and improves the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile may create substantial indication expansion opportunities and have the potential to enhance efficacy by better achieving desired ganaxolone blood levels, improve the safety profile through a more consistent PK profile, reduce dosing frequency, generate new IP, and improve costs of goods through lower active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) requirements. Top-line data from a Phase 1 trial with healthy volunteers utilizing the first candidate for a second-generation formulation of ganaxolone were announced in the second quarter of 2022, including PK characteristics that may allow for twice-daily dosing. We believe that the data support further clinical development of this formulation of ganaxolone. An additional Phase 1 cohort assessing the PK of a second-generation oral formulation candidate has been completed which assessed higher doses of ganaxolone than in the initial phase 1 cohorts. A multiple ascending dose study will be initiated in the second quarter of 2023. This study will also incorporate food effect assessments. We plan to pursue the development of Lennox Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) as a lead indication for a reformulated oral form of ganaxolone, with a Phase 2 trial targeted to begin in the fourth quarter of 2023, and seek additional indications in epilepsy and potentially other therapeutic areas as activities progress.

● | Building on our product pipeline. We may expand and diversify our product pipeline through acquisition of additional drug candidates that fit our business strategy.

COVID-19 
The continued global spread of COVID-19 has impacted our clinical operations and timelines. For example, our RAISE trial is conducted in hospitals, primarily intensive care units in academic medical centers, which have experienced high rates of COVID-19 admissions. Several of these sites participating in the RAISE trial have experienced COVID-related difficulties, including staff turnover and the need to devote significant resources to patients with COVID-19, which has resulted in site initiation and enrollment delays for the RAISE trial. Given these COVID-19-related challenges and the interruption in drug supply in mid-2022, we previously adjusted our expectation for our top-line data readout for the RAISE trial to the second half of 2023. In May 2022, we resumed screening and recruitment for the RAISE trial. Several of the sites participating in the RAISE trial continue to encounter COVID-related setbacks, including staff turnover and the need to devote significant resources for patients with COVID-19. In addition, our ganaxolone clinical trials in the outpatient setting may be negatively impacted if patients and their caregivers do not want to participate while the COVID-19 pandemic persists. The duration and severity of the pandemic and its long-term impact on our business are uncertain at this time.

Our Products and Product Candidates
ZTALMY® (ganaxolone) oral suspension CV
​
ZTALMY is an oral suspension given three times per day that we have developed for the treatment of CDD.  ZTALMY was approved by the FDA in March 2022 for the treatment of seizures associated with CDD in patients 2 years of age and older.  In June 2022, the DEA published an interim final rule in the Federal Register placing ganaxolone and its salts in schedule V of the CSA, which rule became final on December 9, 2022. ZTALMY, our first FDA approved product, became available for commercial sale and shipment to patients with a prescription in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2022. We recorded net U.S. product revenue related to ZTALMY of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
​
CDD is a serious and rare genetic disorder that is caused by a mutation of the CDKL5 gene, located on the X chromosome. CDD is a severely debilitating and potentially fatal genetic condition, which occurs with an estimated frequency of 1:40,000 live births in the U.S. It predominantly affects females and is characterized by early onset, difficult to control seizures and severe neurodevelopmental impairment. The CDKL5 gene encodes proteins essential for 

8



normal brain function. Most children affected by CDD have neurodevelopmental deficits such as difficulty walking, talking and taking care of themselves. Many also suffer from scoliosis, gastrointestinal dysfunction or sleep disorders. Genetic testing is available to determine if a patient has a mutation in the CDKL5 gene. 
​
In June 2017, we were granted FDA orphan drug designation for ganaxolone for the treatment of CDD. The designation provides the drug developer with a seven-year period of U.S. marketing exclusivity, as well as tax credits for clinical research costs, the ability to apply for annual grant funding, clinical research trial design assistance and waiver of Prescription Drug User Fee Act filing fees. Additionally, in November 2019, the European Medical Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) granted orphan drug designation for ganaxolone for the treatment of CDD. In July 2020, the FDA granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation (RPD Designation) for ganaxolone for the treatment of CDD. The FDA grants RPD Designation for diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. and in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations occur primarily in individuals 18 years of age and younger. The approval of ZTALMY in CDD is based on data from the Phase 3 Marigold double-blind placebo-controlled trial, in which 101 patients were randomized and treated with ZTALMY. Patients showed a median 30.7% reduction in 28-day major motor seizure frequency, compared to a median 6.9% reduction for those receiving placebo, achieving the trial’s primary endpoint (p=0.0036). In the Marigold open label extension study, patients treated with ZTALMY for at least 12 months (n=48) experienced a median 49.6% reduction in major motor seizure frequency. On October 13, 2022, we presented two posters at the Child Neurology Society Meeting from our Phase 3 Marigold clinical trial of ZTALMY, including open label extension data showing continued seizure reduction over a two-year period. In the Marigold open-label extension, patients on ganaxolone at 2 years (n=50) showed a median 48.2% reduction in major motor seizure frequency suggesting that ganaxolone may provide sustained efficacy for the treatment of seizures associated with CDD. The discontinuation rate was about 30% during the first year of the open label phase but declined to about 10% during the second year. These data in total suggest that patients who remain on treatment long-term may demonstrate continued reductions in seizure frequency. In the clinical development program, ZTALMY demonstrated efficacy, safety and tolerability with the most common adverse reactions (AEs) (incidence >5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) in the ZTALMY group being somnolence, pyrexia, salivary hypersecretion, and seasonal allergy.
We own families of patents and pending patent applications that claim certain formulations of ganaxolone and cover certain therapeutic uses of ganaxolone, including for treating CDD. The 20-year terms for patents, and applications that issue as patents, in these families run from 2026 through 2042, absent any available patent term adjustments or extensions. We have also licensed from Ovid certain patents that claim certain therapeutic uses of ganaxolone for the treatment of CDD. The licensed patents include a granted U.S. patent, and pending applications in the U.S. and Europe. The 20-year term for these licensed patents and applications that issue as patents will run through 2037, absent any available patent term adjustments.
Priority Review Voucher. As a result of the RPD Designation for ganaxolone for the treatment of CDD, the FDA awarded us a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV) on March 18, 2022 in connection with the approval of the use of ZTALMY in CDD. On July 13, 2022, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (PRV Asset Purchase Agreement) with Novo Nordisk Inc., pursuant to which we agreed to sell the PRV to Novo Nordisk, Inc. for $110.0 million, payable in cash, upon the closing of the transaction. In August 2022, the transaction closed and we received $110.0 million from Novo Nordisk, Inc. 
Commercial Strategy. Since ZTALMY was approved by FDA, we have been focused on the implementation and execution of an integrated launch plan to make ZTALMY available to CDD patients through a specialty pharmacy. Key launch strategies have included and continue to include: (1) establishing our supply chain network and quality management system to assure product is available to patients; (2) driving clinical awareness of ZTALMY as the first and only FDA approved product indicated specifically for seizures associated with CDD; (3) deploying our field sales force to target physicians who treat this rare pediatric patient population; (4) engaging commercial and government payers with the objective of obtaining insurance coverage; and (5) developing our internal capabilities (such as Finance, Human Resources, Information Technology, Data Analytics and Compliance) to support our first launch as a commercial company. 

Marketing Strategy.  Our marketing strategy is to reinforce that seizures are central to the constellation of CDD symptoms, establish ZTALMY as central to the comprehensive management of seizures associated with CDD, and 

9



ensure that patients have seamless access to ZTALMY from prescription through fulfillment. Our marketing campaign for ZTALMY is active, and our integrated commercial launch activities initiated in the third quarter of 2022.
Sales Strategy.   Our commercial sales force includes 16 regional account managers experienced in rare disease. Our field force is targeting identified key accounts and centers of excellence for CDD. Based on our market research, we estimate the addressable patient population for ZTALMY in CDD in the U.S. is approximately 2,000 patients. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we received over 90 CDD prescription enrollment forms, of which more than 70 were for new commercial patients not previously treated with ZTALMY. As this is the first product approved by the FDA specifically for seizures associated with CDD and the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD10) code for CDD was established in 2020, there is limited data available for this specific market. We have strengthened both our market access and field force teams, and both payer and customer engagement are underway.

Market Access.  We have established a cross-functional payer and reimbursement account team with the objective of obtaining and maintaining reimbursement (coverage) of ZTALMY. We are focusing our efforts on reimbursement from commercial payers where pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) control the majority of commercial pharmacy-benefit lives and government payers, primarily Medicaid for the target population for CDD.  We expect approximately 60% of the CDD patient population will access coverage through both Fee-for-Service and Managed Medicaid, with the remaining 40% accessing commercial coverage, with the top PBMs having significant influence. Of the CDD patient enrollment forms received in the year ended December 31, 2022, over 75% received favorable reimbursement coverage and therapy in the year. The prescribing and fulfillment process for ZTALMY is managed through ZTALMY One™, a comprehensive patient support program. Enrollment in the program offers various support and information to help caregivers and patients prescribed ZTALMY access their ZTALMY prescription and assist in determining eligibility for and access to co-pay support or free drug programs.

Specialty Pharmacy.  We are utilizing Orsini Pharmaceutical Services, LLC (Orsini), a specialty pharmacy, to provide services for patients, including patient enrollment, benefit verification and investigation, prior authorization support, patient education and drug counseling, dispensing of product and shipment coordination. We recorded our first sales of ZTALMY to Orsini in the third quarter of 2022.

Infrastructure.  We continue to enhance our internal capabilities and processes to support a commercial stage company.  We have implemented a healthcare compliance program to guide our compliance with rules and regulations regarding pharmaceutical sales. 
​
Manufacture of Commercial Supply. We have executed commercial supply agreements for ganaxolone API with our current manufacturer and also with our current supplier for finished bulk drug product. Additionally, we have executed a master supply agreement with a second API supplier in the U.S. to undertake certain process development activities and subsequently to provide commercial supplies of API and/or API intermediates.
​
Regulated as a Controlled Substance. On June 1, 2022, the DEA published an interim final rule in the Federal Register placing ganaxolone and its salts in schedule V of the CSA, which rule became final December 9, 2022. Under the CSA, drugs are classified into five (5) distinct categories or schedules depending upon the drug’s acceptable medical use and the drug’s abuse or dependency potential. Schedule V is defined by the DEA as drugs with lower potential for abuse than schedule IV and consist of preparations containing limited quantities of certain narcotics. ZTALMY became available for commercial sale and shipment to patients with a prescription in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2022. As a controlled substance, ganaxolone is subject to the applicable CSA requirements such as registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting, storage manufacturing, distribution, importation and other requirements. 
​
Post Marketing Requirements. In connection with FDA approval of ZTALMY for CDD, we have several post marketing commitments. The Phase 1 renal impairment study commitment was completed and submitted to the FDA in May 2022. The Phase 1 hepatic impairment study and the thorough QTc study were completed and submitted to the FDA in December 2022. The remaining post-marketing requirements include: 2-year carcinogenicity studies of ganaxolone and the major human unconjugated plasma metabolite, M2, in rats; a 26-week carcinogenicity of ganaxolone in transgenic mice; a juvenile animal toxicity study of the major human unconjugated plasma metabolite, M2, in rats; 

10



extractable/leachable study results on the container closure system; a CNS distribution study of the M47 metabolite in rats; and in vitro studies to assess the drug interaction potential of M47 metabolite. We expect to be able to complete these remaining required FDA studies within the requested FDA timeframe. 
​
Marketing Authorization Application 

In August 2021, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA granted our request for accelerated assessment of ganaxolone for the treatment of seizures associated with CDD. The marketing authorization application (MAA) for ganaxolone was submitted to the EMA on October 11, 2021 and on October 28, 2021 we received formal notification from the EMA that the CDD MAA was validated. With this validation, the EMA began its formal review of the MAA under the centralized procedure. In February 2022, the MAA was converted to a standard review timeline. 

Further, the CHMP granted an extension to our Day 120 clock stop, and as a result, we submitted our Day 120 responses to the EMA on November 22, 2022. We received the Day 180 report, including a List of Outstanding Issues (LoOI) from the EMA on January 26, 2023. The LoOI contains a number of outstanding major objections and other concerns, including a major objection related to the choice of our regulatory starting material (RSM). The CHMP has indicated that the proposed RSM is not acceptable and should be redefined further upstream. We may not be able to timely address all of the objections to the CHMP’s satisfaction. An initial 30-day clock stop extension was requested and granted to allow for time to respond to the issues raised by the CHMP. The CHMP is expected to present its opinion on the MAA in the second quarter of 2023. If outstanding issues remain unresolved, we or the CHMP may request an oral explanation, which may or may not be granted. Further delays in the review and approval process could occur if we are not able to timely or adequately respond to the CHMP’s objections and concerns. If we were to ultimately receive a negative opinion on the MAA, we would have the opportunity to request a re-examination by the CHMP.
​
Our Pipeline 
We are developing ganaxolone in indications where there is a mechanistic rationale for ganaxolone to provide a benefit, including the following indications:

​

Status Epilepticus (SE)
SE is a life-threatening condition characterized by continuous, prolonged seizures or rapidly recurring seizures without intervening recovery of consciousness. If SE is not treated urgently, permanent neuronal damage may occur, which contributes to high rates of morbidity and mortality. Patients with SE who do not respond to first-line benzodiazepine treatment are classified as having ESE and those who then progress to and then fail at least one second-line antiepileptic drug (AED) are classified as having RSE. In RSE, synaptic GABAA receptors are internalized into the neuron, resulting in decreased responsiveness to drugs such as benzodiazepines. RSE unresponsiveness to one or more second-line AEDs requires treatment with IV anesthesia to terminate seizures and prevent neuronal injury and other complications. The IV anesthetic is increased to a level that induces deep coma and is maintained at that rate for 24 hours or more. SE that recurs following an attempted wean of IV anesthesia is classified as super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE). In April 2016, we were granted FDA orphan drug designation for the IV formulation of ganaxolone for the treatment of SE, which includes RSE.
​
In January 2021, we enrolled the first patient in the Phase 3 pivotal RAISE trial. The RAISE trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with RSE. We expect approximately 80 trial sites in hospitals, primarily across the U.S. and Canada, to participate. The RAISE trial is designed to enroll approximately 124 patients, who will be randomized to receive ganaxolone or placebo added to standard of care. With this number of patients, the trial is designed to provide over 90% power to detect a 30% efficacy difference between ganaxolone and placebo. 
The co-primary endpoints for the RAISE trial are (1) proportion of patients with RSE who experience seizure cessation within 30 minutes of treatment initiation without other medications for SE treatment, and (2) proportion of patients with no progression to IV anesthesia for 36 hours following initiation of the study drug. In June 2022, we announced that we amended the protocol for the RAISE trial to expand eligibility criteria to support recruitment. We broadened the inclusion criteria to permit patients previously treated with up to 18 hours of high-dose IV anesthesia to qualify for the trial, rather than excluding patients treated with anesthetics at high doses for any duration. We believe this will facilitate the enrollment of patients transferred to the ICU from other hospitals or the emergency room, who may already have received high doses of anesthetic medication for less than 18 hours. We reached alignment with the FDA on the protocol amendment, including a proposal for a potential interim analysis when two-thirds of the patients (approximately 82) have completed the trial.
Several academic medical centers and intensive care units participating in the RAISE trial have experienced COVID-related difficulties, including staff turnover and the need to devote significant resources to patients with COVID-19, which has resulted in site initiation and enrollment delays. Additionally, in February 2022, we temporarily paused the RAISE trial after routine monitoring of stability batches of clinical supply material indicated that it became necessary to reduce the shelf life to less than the anticipated 24 months to meet product stability testing specifications. We notified the FDA of this issue and our plans to proactively pause the trial, and we subsequently provided additional information to the FDA to support resuming trial activities. In May 2022, we announced that the trial had resumed utilizing new batches of the current IV formulation of ganaxolone, and we implemented a reduced shelf life of 12 months. In agreement with the FDA, ganaxolone clinical supplies will be stored under refrigerated conditions for the entire duration of clinical use. We manufactured the IV ganaxolone formulation with a new buffer and are targeting a shelf life of at least 24 months. The FDA agreed that in principle a buffer change in the ganaxolone IV formulation is acceptable. 
We are working closely with key investigators and site coordinators to support enrollment efficiencies at existing RAISE trial sites and are also increasing the number of U.S. centers participating in the trial. Additionally, we plan to expand the trial to sites in Canada and Australia. Consistent with the prior announcement, we expect our top-line data readout for the RAISE trial to be available in the second half of 2023.
Planning continues for a separate Phase 3 RSE trial to support an MAA in Europe (RAISE II trial). We gained alignment on the trial design at a meeting with the EMA in the first quarter of 2021. Due to the delay in clinical trial supply mentioned for the RAISE trial, the RAISE II trial initiation is planned for the second half of 2023. RAISE II will be a double blind, placebo-controlled pivotal registration trial expected to enroll 70 patients who have failed first-line 

12



benzodiazepine treatment and at least one second-line AED. Patients will receive either ganaxolone or placebo, administered in combination with a standard-of-care second-line AED. The simultaneous administration of a standard-of-care AED with the trial medication is expected to provide data complementary to that from the RAISE trial. There are two additional key differences between the RAISE and RAISE II trials. First, rather than specifying progression to IV anesthesia as a treatment failure, under the RAISE II protocol any escalation of care will constitute a treatment failure. This could be IV anesthesia or another second-line IV AED. Second, the primary analysis for the RAISE II trial will be a responder analysis, with response defined as SE cessation within 30 minutes and no escalation of care within 36 hours, rather than the co-primary endpoints in the RAISE trial, which require statistical significance to be achieved independently on both the 30-minute and 36-hour outcomes.
The FDA has indicated alignment on the overall trial design for a third SE trial, the RESET trial, a Phase 2 trial evaluating ganaxolone in the treatment of ESE, for which enrollment in the U.S. is expected to commence in the first half of 2023. The RESET trial will enroll patients with convulsive SE presenting to emergency departments, and will be conducted under Exception from Informed Consent (EFIC) guidelines. The RESET trial will consist of two phases: an initial open-label, dose optimization phase and a subsequent double-blind placebo-controlled phase. In the open-label portion of the trial, sequential cohorts will receive IV ganaxolone for varying durations and at different doses. The dosing for each cohort will depend on the treatment effect and tolerability seen in the previous one, with the expected optimal dose and duration of ganaxolone incorporated in the double-blind phase of the trial to follow. We expect that the double-blind placebo-controlled phase will enroll approximately 80 ESE patients randomized equally to IV ganaxolone or placebo added to a standard-of-care AED. The primary efficacy endpoint will be the absence of electrographic (rapid EEG) evidence of SE or recurrence of generalized convulsions at 1 hour after the initiation of treatment. We are targeting data from the first dose-finding cohort of the RESET trial by the end of 2023.
In September 2021, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) granted us a patent on a method of treating SE, including dosing regimens. This issued patent expires in 2040. That patent is a member of a patent family we own that includes pending patent applications that claim certain therapeutic regimens for the treatment of SE, including RSE, using intravenous ganaxolone. On July 26, 2022, the USPTO issued a patent to Ovid with claims that encompass our product candidate for the treatment of SE. Ovid may file a lawsuit against us alleging infringement of its patents and/or we may challenge the validity of Ovid’s patents with the USPTO or through the courts. Any such proceeding, regardless of its outcome, would likely result in the expenditure of significant financial resources and the diversion of management’s time and resources. In addition, any such proceeding may cause negative publicity, adversely impact patients, and we may be prohibited from marketing or selling ganaxolone for SE, RSE and ESE during such proceedings or if we are not successful in such proceedings. If Ovid does decide to bring an infringement lawsuit, we do not expect that it will be filed before a commercial launch of ganaxolone for SE, RSE or ESE based upon the “safe harbor” provisions of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Hatch-Waxman Act). We may need to acquire or obtain a license to the Ovid patents to market or sell ganaxolone for SE, RSE and ESE, which may not be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all. If we are not able to acquire the Ovid patents or negotiate a license on acceptable terms, and if our product is determined to infringe Ovid’s patents and the patents are determined to be valid, then we may be forced to pay Ovid royalties, damages and costs, or we may be prevented from commercializing ganaxolone for SE, RSE and ESE altogether, which would have a material adverse impact on our business.
​
Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)
TSC is a rare genetic disorder that affects many organs by causing, typically non-malignant, tumors in the brain, skin, kidney, heart, eyes, and lungs. The condition is caused by inherited mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene. It occurs with a frequency of approximately 1:6,000 live births, with a mutation being found in 85% of patients. While the disease phenotype can be extremely variable, epilepsy occurs with a frequency of up to 85%. TSC is a leading cause of genetic epilepsy, often manifesting in the first year of life as either focal seizures or infantile spasms. There are currently few disease-specific treatments approved for seizures in TSC. Orphan drug designation for ganaxolone for the treatment in TSC was granted by the FDA in August 2021 and by the EMA in October 2021. 
In August 2021, we announced top-line data from our open-label Phase 2 trial (CALM trial) evaluating the safety and efficacy of adjunctive oral ganaxolone in 23 patients with seizures associated with TSC. The CALM trial enrolled 23 patients ages 2 to 32 who entered a four-week baseline period followed by a 12-week treatment period, during which they received up to 600 mg of ganaxolone (oral liquid suspension) three times a day. Patients who met 

13



eligibility criteria were able to continue ganaxolone treatment during a 24-week extension. The primary endpoint was the percent change in 28-day TSC-associated seizure frequency during the 12-week treatment period relative to the four-week baseline period. Secondary outcome measures included the percentage of patients experiencing a greater than or equal to 50% reduction in 28-day TSC-associated seizure frequency through the end of the 12-week treatment period compared to the 4-week baseline period.
The primary endpoint showed a median 16.6% reduction in 28-day in the frequency of TSC-associated seizures relative to the four-week baseline period. A secondary endpoint showed that the proportion of patients that achieved at least a 50% seizure reduction was 30.4%. During the trial, patients with focal seizures (n=19) showed a median 25.2% reduction in focal seizure frequency. Ganaxolone was generally well-tolerated with somnolence reported as the most common AE. In addition, one serious adverse event (SAE) of worsening seizures occurred, which was assessed by the investigator as treatment-related. Four patients discontinued the trial due to AEs. Additionally, the data from the trial suggested that in patients on concomitant Epidiolex, early elevation of ganaxolone blood levels occurred and appeared to be linked to greater somnolence. The interpretation of these findings is limited by the small sample size and open-label design of the trial. A formal Phase 1 drug-drug interaction trial was completed, demonstrating a lack of significant interaction between ganaxolone and Epidiolex. Additionally, the titration schedule for all subjects in the Phase 3 TSC trial has been adjusted to maximize tolerability. 
​
In response to our request for an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA regarding a proposed Phase 3 TSC trial, the FDA provided written responses to our questions in lieu of a meeting. We believe the written responses show overall alignment on the clinical development plan in TSC. We believe that, based on the FDA’s written responses, and with FDA approval of CDD, a single trial could serve as necessary support for regulatory approval for TSC in the U.S. In response to our request for Protocol Assistance, which is a special form of scientific advice available for developers of designated orphan medicines for rare diseases, the EMA provided written feedback in December 2021 in lieu of a meeting. We believe the written responses from the EMA, like those from the FDA, show overall alignment on the clinical development plan in TSC. After commencing site initiations in the first quarter of 2022 and dosing the first patient in the second quarter of 2022, we are actively enrolling patients in the U.S., Spain, Germany and the United Kingdom for this global Phase 3 randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial (TrustTSC trial) of adjunctive ganaxolone in approximately 160 TSC patients. We expect to expand the trial to include up to 90 sites, including several TSC centers of excellence, predominantly in the U.S., Western Europe, Canada and Israel. The primary endpoint for the TrustTSC trial is percent change in 28-day frequency of TSC-associated seizures. We plan to announce top-line data from the TrustTSC trial in the first quarter of 2024.

Second-Generation Formulation, Prodrug Development and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS)
Top-line data from a Phase 1 trial with healthy volunteers utilizing the first candidate for a second-generation formulation of ganaxolone were announced in the second quarter of 2022, including PK characteristics that may allow for twice-daily dosing. We believe that the data support further clinical development of this formulation of ganaxolone. An additional Phase 1 cohort of assessing the PK of the second-generation oral formulation candidate has been completed, which assessed higher doses of ganaxolone than in the initial phase 1 cohorts. A multiple ascending dose study will be initiated in the second quarter of 2023. This study will also incorporate food effect assessments.
​
The development of ganaxolone prodrug compounds continues to advance, with lead oral and IV candidates selected, and Phase 1 data targeted for 2024.
​
We plan to pursue the development of ganaxolone for LGS, a severe form of epilepsy that typically begins between one and eight years of age. Affected children have neurodevelopmental impairments and intractable seizures, including focal, atonic, tonic and atypical absence seizures. Given the overlap in seizure types and etiologies with other disorders where ganaxolone has potential to reduce seizures, such as CDD and TSC, we believe that LGS represents a promising opportunity for ganaxolone development. We are planning to utilize a second-generation formulation of ganaxolone for the LGS development program, with a Phase 2 trial targeted to begin in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Orphan Designations
The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to ganaxolone for the treatment of Infantile Spasms, SE, CDD, TSC, PCDH19-RE and Fragile X Syndrome. Orphan drug designation is granted by the FDA Office of Orphan Products Development to novel drugs or biologics that treat a rare disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 patients in the U.S. The designation provides the drug developer with a seven-year period of U.S. marketing exclusivity, as well as tax credits for clinical research costs, the ability to apply for annual grant funding, clinical research trial design assistance and waiver of Prescription Drug User Fee Act filing fees.
Ganaxolone Mechanism of Action 
Ganaxolone is a methylated analog of the endogenous neurosteroid, allopregnanolone. Allopregnanolone exhibits potent anxiolytic, antidepressant and anti-seizure activity. Unlike allopregnanolone, ganaxolone cannot be back-converted to active intermediates possessing steroid hormone activity.
Both ganaxolone and allopregnanolone bind to GABAA receptors that, when activated, permit flow of chloride ions into the neuron. This change in concentration of chloride ions results in hyperpolarization and is the basis for the inhibitory effect of GABA. Classic GABAA active drugs bind only at receptors located on the synapse between neurons. However, both allopregnanolone and ganaxolone also bind to extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. Synaptic GABAA receptors respond quickly to inhibit neurotransmission (phasic inhibition), while extrasynaptic GABAA receptors provide a constant baseline level of inhibition (tonic inhibition).
Activity at extrasynaptic GABAA receptors may be of particular importance for the prolonged seizures in SE, during which synaptic, but not extrasynaptic, receptors become internalized into the neuron and are unavailable for binding of GABAergic drugs.
Safety Overview
Oral Safety
More than 2,300 individuals have received oral formulations of ganaxolone for durations from one day to more than two years at doses of 50 to 2,000 mg/day. Ganaxolone was administered in Phase 2 clinical trials to pediatric patients at doses up to 1,800 mg/day and to adult patients at doses up to 1,875 mg/day. The majority of AEs were non-serious and resolved upon discontinuation of therapy. The most common side effects with oral ganaxolone relate to sedation or somnolence. In the oral ganaxolone safety database there are no trends of medically important changes in blood chemistry, vital signs, liver function, renal function or cardiovascular parameters in adult or pediatric populations.

In the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial (Marigold Trial), which evaluated the use of oral ganaxolone in children and young adults with CDD, ganaxolone was generally well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with previous clinical trials. The most common adverse reactions (incidence of at least 5% and at least twice the rate of placebo) were somnolence, pyrexia, salivary hypersecretion, and seasonal allergy. Somnolence and sedation appeared early during treatment and were generally dose related. Antiepileptic drugs, including ZTALMY, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. In addition, as with most antiepileptic drugs, ganaxolone should be withdrawn gradually to minimize the risk of increased seizure frequency and SE.
There were no deaths reported in the double-blind phase of the Marigold Trial. Three deaths globally have occurred during the open label extension phase of the trial, two of which were assessed by the investigators as unrelated to trial treatment. The third death was assessed by the investigator as probably related to trial medication. Given the severity of CDD and its medical complications, serious adverse events or deaths may occur which, in the absence of a control group, make determination of relatedness to treatment difficult.
In the Phase 2 TSC trial, ganaxolone was generally well tolerated with somnolence reported as the most common AE, consistent with previous studies. Concomitant Epidiolex appeared to be linked to greater somnolence. A 

15



formal Phase 1 drug-drug interaction trial was completed, demonstrating a lack of significant interaction between ganaxolone and Epidiolex. Additionally, the titration schedule for all subjects in the Phase 3 TSC trial has been adjusted to maximize tolerability.
IV Safety
In 2016, we completed a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial with IV ganaxolone that enrolled 36 patients, designed to determine the PK, pharmacodynamics (PD), and safety of IV ganaxolone administered as an ascending bolus dose (Stage 1) or continuous infusion (Stage 2).  Thirty-six healthy volunteers were enrolled. 
Every dose regimen of IV ganaxolone, either bolus or continuous infusion, was generally safe and well-tolerated and rapidly reached targeted dose levels.  Six treatment-emergent AEs were reported, all of which were mild in severity and resolved without intervention. Only headache was considered possibly related to trial treatment. No patient discontinued due to an AE and no SAEs were reported. IV ganaxolone plasma concentrations were generally proportional to the administered dose. In addition, the continuous infusion of IV ganaxolone achieved the targeted exposure levels associated with anticonvulsant activity.
In 2019, we announced positive top-line results in our open-label, dose-finding Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating IV ganaxolone in patients with RSE. In the trial, ganaxolone had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile for the RSE patient population in all dose groups. There were 10 SAEs; eight were considered not related to treatment and two were considered treatment-related (TRSAEs). The TRSAEs were severe sedation in two patients that led to early ganaxolone discontinuation: one in the medium dose group on day three and one in the target dose group on day one. There were 50 AEs, thirteen of which were considered treatment-related (TRAEs) reported in seven patients.  The most commonly reported TRAEs were somnolence, mild hypotension and sedation.
Preclinical Pharmacology and Toxicology
We have completed preclinical safety pharmacology and toxicology testing, including reproductive toxicology. Animal pharmacokinetic and in vitro studies show that ganaxolone is metabolized primarily by the Cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A (CYP3A) family of liver enzymes, a common route of drug metabolism. All in vitro studies have shown that ganaxolone has low potential for interaction with other drugs at several multiples of observed human ganaxolone levels. Neither ganaxolone nor its metabolites have a ketone ring at the 3-position, a requirement for hormonal activity. In binding and functional activity studies, ganaxolone has no appreciable affinity for estrogen or progesterone receptors. We found no evidence of changes in blood, liver, kidney or the gastrointestinal systems indicating functional or anatomical adverse effects associated with either single- or multiple-dose treatment with ganaxolone in preclinical safety pharmacology studies, nor have we seen evidence of any end organ toxicity from human clinical trials. We have not detected potential for ganaxolone to cause cellular mutations or carcinogenicity in trials to date.
Ganaxolone is metabolized extensively in animals and humans.  During the development of CDD, one major metabolite (M2) was present in plasma of humans that was not found in plasma of rats or dogs. The chemical structure of M2 has been identified. An activity assay, dose range finding study in rats and an in vivo micronucleus with comet analysis for the detection of genotoxicity have been conducted and the results submitted to the FDA. Results from additional preclinical studies are required to the FDA as post-marketing requirement(s). These include: 2-year carcinogenicity studies of ganaxolone and the major human unconjugated plasma metabolite, M2, in rats; a 26-week carcinogenicity of ganaxolone in transgenic mice; a juvenile animal toxicity study of the major human unconjugated plasma metabolite, M2, in rats; a CNS distribution study of the M47 metabolite in rats; and in vitro studies to assess the drug interaction potential of M47 metabolite. Additional post-marketing requirements include: phase 1 renal and hepatic impairment studies and a thorough QTc study; and extractable/leachable study results on the container closure system. The Phase 1 renal impairment study commitment was completed and submitted to the FDA in May 2022. The Phase 1 hepatic impairment study and the thorough QTc study were completed and submitted to the FDA in December 2022. We plan to complete the required FDA studies within the required FDA timeframe. However, there is a risk that the studies could take longer than expected to complete or the studies may have adverse findings which may require additional 

16



investments and have the potential to materially impact our marketing of Ztalmy. In the EU, if additional studies are needed, these are usually required before or during MAA review.
​
In reproductive toxicology studies, ganaxolone did not cause malformations of the embryo or fetus in rats or mice and did not significantly affect the development of offspring. No changes in sperm parameters were found. We believe these findings are important, as many currently marketed AEDs have shown developmental toxicities in animal studies, including fetal death and skeletal abnormalities. Valproate, carbamazepine, phenytoin, topiramate and other AEDs have been linked to birth defects in humans (e.g., head and facial malformations and lowered birth weight). These findings have resulted in labeling for these drugs indicating evidence of human fetal risk.
Intellectual Property 
The proprietary nature of and protection for ZTALMY, other indications being developed for ganaxolone and any other future product candidates, discovery programs and know-how are important to our business. We have sought patent protection in the U.S. and internationally for synthetic methods for making ganaxolone, ganaxolone nanoparticles, which are used in certain oral solid, oral liquid, and IV dose formulations, other injectable and oral ganaxolone formulations, and methods of treatment using ganaxolone. Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights whether developed internally or licensed from third parties and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. The patents and patent applications owned by us comprise approximately 17 different patent families, filed in various jurisdictions around the world.
Nanoparticle Ganaxolone Formulations. We own approximately four patent families directed to nanoparticle formulations of ganaxolone and complexing agents that deliver consistent exposure and improved stability of ganaxolone, and certain uses of the formulations. One of the patent families includes eight issued U.S. patents with claims directed to certain solid and liquid ganaxolone formulations and certain methods for the making and use thereof. Corresponding foreign patents have been granted in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea. The 20-year term for patents in this family runs through 2026, absent any available patent term adjustments or extensions. We have filed for a patent term extension of a granted U.S. patent in this patent family that covers ZTALMY. Our patent term extension application requests an extension of five (5) years, which is the maximum extension available under the Hatch-Waxman Act. If the full extension is granted, this U.S. patent would be extended to November 28, 2031. The application for patent term extension is pending at the USPTO. We have not out-licensed any rights to practice these patents in any of these territories. Pursuant to our agreement with Domain Russia Investments Limited (DRI), we assigned to DRI patent rights, which rights were subsequently assigned to NovaMedica LLC (NovaMedica), along with the right to develop and commercialize ganaxolone in Russia and certain other member countries of the Eurasian Patent Organization. 
We have approximately four patent families consisting of three pending U.S. provisional applications directed to ganaxolone analogs and/or additional formulations of ganaxolone, and an international application filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) that is directed to additional formulations of ganaxolone.

One of the patent families includes pending applications in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, India, Japan, South Africa, and the U.S. that claim certain injectable ganaxolone formulations containing sulfobutyl ether-beta-cyclodextrin and certain methods of use of the formulations, including for the treatment of SE. The 20-year term for this patent family runs through to 2036, absent any available patent term adjustments or extensions. A second patent family currently includes one issued U.S. patent with claims directed to certain therapeutic regimens for the treatment of SE using IV ganaxolone, 

17



and an international application filed under the PCT that is directed to certain therapeutic regimens for the treatment of SE using IV ganaxolone. The 20-year term for patents based on this international application will run through 2040, absent any available patent term adjustments. We intend to file national phase applications in various foreign jurisdictions based on this PCT application before applicable deadlines. A third patent family currently consists of a pending international application filed under the PCT that is directed to certain therapeutic uses of IV ganaxolone. We intend to file national phase applications in various foreign jurisdictions based on the PCT application before applicable deadlines. The 20-year term for patents based on this international application will run through 2041, absent any applicable available patent term adjustments. A fourth patent family currently consists of a pending international application filed under the PCT directed to certain therapeutic uses for SE. We intend to file national phase applications in various foreign jurisdictions based on this PCT application before applicable deadlines. The 20-year term for patents based on this international application will run through 2042, absent any available patent term adjustments.
Additional Therapeutic Uses. We own approximately four patent families directed to certain therapeutic uses of ganaxolone, including for treating genetic epilepsy disorders, such as CDD and PCDH19-Related Epilepsy (PCDH19-RE), and TSC. One of the patent families includes pending applications filed in Australia, Canada, China, Eurasia, Europe, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and the U.S. that claim certain methods of treating epileptic disorders. The 20-year term for patents in this family runs through 2038, absent any available patent term adjustments or extensions. A second patent family currently includes one pending international patent application filed under the PCT that claims certain methods of treating TSC. We intend to file national phase applications in various foreign jurisdictions based on this PCT application before applicable deadlines. The 20-year term for patents based on this family run through 2040, absent any available patent term adjustments or extensions. A third family currently comprises one pending international patent application filed under this PCT directed to certain therapeutic regimens for certain disorders using ganaxolone. We intend to file national phase applications in various foreign jurisdictions based on this PCT application before applicable deadlines. The 20-year term for patents based on this family run through 2041, absent any available patent term adjustments or extensions. A fourth patent family currently consists of a pending international patent application filed under this PCT directed to certain therapeutic regimens for certain disorders using ganaxolone. We intend to file national phase applications in various foreign jurisdictions based on this PCT application before applicable deadlines. The 20-year term for patents based on this family run through 2042, absent any available patent term adjustments or extensions.
We have also licensed from Ovid certain patents that are directed to certain therapeutic uses of ganaxolone for the treatment of CDD. The licensed patent family includes a granted U.S. patent and a pending application in Europe. The 20-year term for patents based on this international application will run through 2037, absent any available patent term adjustments.
In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain a competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, through confidentiality agreements with our employees, collaborators, contractors and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and some of our collaborators. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party.
General Considerations
As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify a proprietary position for our ganaxolone synthesis and formulations will depend upon our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims once granted. Our commercial success will depend in part upon not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent could require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, obtain licenses, or cease certain activities. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights.
As discussed in the Government Regulation section below, the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for patent term extension, which provides patent term restoration as compensation for the patent 

18



term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Hatch-Waxman Act) permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive approval in the U.S. or other countries, we expect to apply for patent term extensions, where available, on patents covering those products in the respective jurisdictions.
Many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and academic institutions are competing with us in the field of neuropsychiatric disorders and filing patent applications potentially relevant to our business. Even if a particular third-party patent is identified as possibly being relevant to our product candidates or technology, we may conclude upon a thorough analysis, that we do not infringe upon the patent or that the patent is invalid. If the third-party patent owner disagrees with our conclusion and we continue with the business activity in question, we may be subject to patent litigation. Alternatively, we might decide to initiate litigation in an attempt to have a court declare the third-party patent invalid or non-infringed by our activity. In either scenario, patent litigation typically is costly and time-consuming, and the outcome can be favorable or unfavorable.
Licenses and Collaborations
Orion
On July 30, 2021, we entered into a collaboration agreement (Orion Collaboration Agreement) with Orion Corporation (Orion), whereby Orion received exclusive rights to commercialize the oral and IV dose formulations of ganaxolone in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom and Switzerland in multiple seizure disorders, including CDD, TSC and RSE. Under the agreement, we received a €25 million ($29.6 million) upfront fee and are eligible to receive up to an additional €97 million in R&D reimbursement and cash milestone payments based on specific clinical and commercial achievements, as well as tiered royalty payments based on net sales ranging from the low double digits to the high teens for the oral programs and the low double-digits to the low twenties for the IV programs. 
Tenacia
On November 16, 2022, we entered into a collaboration and supply agreement with Tenacia Biotechnology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (Tenacia), whereby Tenacia received exclusive rights to develop and commercialize certain oral and IV formulations of ganaxolone in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of certain human diseases, disorders or conditions, initially for the treatment of CDD, TSC and SE. In connection with the agreement, we received an upfront cash payment of $10 million in December 2022 and are eligible to receive up to an additional $256 million upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales-based milestones. Tenacia has further agreed to pay us tiered royalty payments based on annual net sales ranging from the low double digits to the mid-teens for each of the oral formulation, IV formulation and selected product formulation of licensed products. 
Other Distribution Agreements
We have entered into an agreement for commercialization of ganaxolone in other territories with NovaMedica whereby NovaMedica has the right to market and sell ganaxolone in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. We continue to assess opportunities in other markets to further expand the distribution and commercialization of ganaxolone globally.
CyDex 
In March 2017, we entered into a License Agreement and a Supply Agreement with CyDex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CyDex).  Under the terms of the License Agreement, CyDex granted us an exclusive license to use CyDex’s sulfobutylether beta-cyclodextrin, or Captisol®, drug formulation system and related intellectual property in connection 

19



with the development and commercialization of ganaxolone in any and all therapeutic uses in humans, with some exceptions. 
As consideration for this license, we paid an upfront fee and are required to make additional payments in the future upon achievement of various specified clinical and regulatory milestones.  We will also be required to pay royalties to CyDex on sales of ganaxolone, if successfully developed, in the low-to-mid single digits based on levels of annual net sales. As of March 24, 2022, we have achieved one milestone under the License Agreement, which occurred and was paid in the first quarter of 2021. Certain patents relating to Captisol®, including some that were licensed to us by CyDex, have expired, while other patents that are licensed to us remain in force.
Under the terms of the Supply Agreement, we are required to purchase all of our requirements for Captisol with respect to ganaxolone from CyDex, and CyDex is required to supply us with Captisol for such purposes, subject to certain limitations.
Purdue Neuroscience Company (Purdue)
In September 2004, we entered into a license agreement with Purdue, which was amended and restated in May 2008 (Purdue License Agreement), that granted us exclusive rights to certain know-how and technology relating to ganaxolone, excluding the field of treatment of unpleasant sensory or emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage. The agreement contains a right by us to sublicense, subject to prior written approval by Purdue, and we have sublicensed our licensed rights to NovaMedica for the Covered Territory. We are obligated to pay royalties as a percentage in the range of high single digits up to 10% of net product sales for direct licensed products, such as ganaxolone. The obligation to pay royalties expires, on a country-by-country basis, ten years from the first commercial sale of a licensed product in each country. Upon commercialization, we estimate the in-licensed technology would result in us paying royalties to Purdue in the low single digits as a percentage of sales. Other payment obligations may be triggered if we successfully partner our product candidates with third parties. In addition, the agreement also requires that we pay Purdue a percentage in the mid-single digits of the non-royalty consideration that we receive from a sublicensee and a percentage in the twenties of milestone payments received from sublicensees for indications other than seizure disorders and vascular migraine headaches not associated with mood disorders. Under the license agreement, we are committed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one licensed product. 
On July 14, 2022, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to sell our PRV for $110 million. Thereafter, we received a letter dated August 1, 2022 from Purdue in which Purdue claimed that it was owed $5.5 million by us from the sale of the PRV pursuant to the Purdue License Agreement. Our position communicated to Purdue is that we do not owe Purdue any of the proceeds from the sale of the PRV. Purdue maintains that they are owed the $5.5 million. No associated payment has been made and we continue to discuss this matter with Purdue. 
Ovid License
In March 2022, we entered into an exclusive patent license agreement (License Agreement) with Ovid Therapeutics Inc. (Ovid). Under the License Agreement, we have an exclusive, non-transferable (except as provided in the License Agreement), royalty-bearing, sublicensable license under certain of Ovid’s patent(s) and patent applications to develop, make, have made, commercialize, promote, distribute, sell, offer for sale and import, ganaxolone, including any analogues or derivatives, including its salts, and pharmaceutical formulations of the foregoing (Licensed Products), in the U.S., the member states of the EU, Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland (Territory) for the treatment of CDD in humans (Field). Under the License Agreement, we have the sole right and responsibility for, and control over, all development, manufacturing, and commercialization activities, including all regulatory activities, with respect to the Licensed Products in the Field in the Territory. In addition, all regulatory approvals and related filings with respect to the Licensed Products in the Field in the Territory will be in the name of, and be owned solely by, us. We were required, at Ovid’s option exercisable in accordance with the License Agreement, to (i) pay to Ovid the sum of $1.5 million in cash; or (ii) issue to Ovid 123,255 shares of our common stock, which option to obtain shares of our common stock was exercisable within the five-business day period following the filing of 

20



our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 on March 24, 2022. On March 29, 2022, we issued 123,255 shares of our common stock to Ovid, per Ovid’s option in accordance with the License Agreement. As such, we recorded $1.2 million of IP license fee expenses related to the Ovid License Agreement in the year ended December 31, 2022. The License Agreement provides for payment of royalties by us to Ovid in the low single digits on net sales by us, our affiliates and sublicensees, of Licensed Products in the Field in the Territory. Such royalties are subject to reduction in the event of generic competition in accordance with the License Agreement. We may terminate the License Agreement at any time without cause on thirty days’ prior written notice. Either party may terminate the License Agreement for the other party’s material breach or insolvency subject to certain cure periods. Also, Ovid has the right to terminate the License Agreement if there has not been a first commercial sale of any Licensed Products in the Field in the Territory on or before June 30, 2025. In the event of termination, all licenses granted under the License Agreement will terminate.
Competition 
The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from both large and small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specifically from companies that treat rare seizure disorders.
There are a variety of available therapies marketed for rare seizure disorders. In many cases, these products are administered in combination to enhance efficacy or to reduce side effects. Some of these drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, some are in clinical development and not yet approved, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved drugs are well established therapies or products and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payers. Insurers and other third-party payers may also encourage the use of generic products. More established companies have a competitive advantage over us due to their greater size, cash flows, established commercial infrastructure, clinician relationships and institutional experience. Compared to us, many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources with longer histories of marketed products.
Our competitors may also develop drugs that are safer, more effective, more widely used and less costly than ours, and may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products. These appreciable advantages could render ganaxolone obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of ganaxolone’s development and commercialization.
We primarily compete with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are developing clinical-stage therapies or marketing drugs to treat indications that we are targeting.
SE
SE patients generally are treated with benzodiazepines as first-line treatment. When benzodiazepines are not effective the patients are in ESE and are treated with various second-line IV AEDs, such as levetiracetam, fosphenytoin, lacosamide, or valproate. In 2019, a multicenter, randomized clinical trial (Established Status Epilepticus Treatment Trial; ESETT) was conducted by a group of academic investigators and was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of second-line IV AEDs in ESE. In this trial, the efficacy of levetiracetam, fosphenytoin, or valproate was evaluated in convulsive ESE patients. It was reported that levetiracetam, fosphenytoin, and valproate were effective at stopping SE in 47%, 45%, and 46% of the patients, respectively. When second-line AEDs are not effective, RSE patients are generally placed in a medically-induced coma under IV anesthesia in an attempt to stop the seizures and prevent further damage to the brain and death. Patients on third-line IV anesthesia are at higher risk for anesthesia-associated morbidities, such as infection, and have 2.9 times greater mortality rate. In addition, patients on IV anesthetics for SE treatment have increased lengths of stays in the hospital and ICU resulting in increased healthcare utilization. To our knowledge, there are no treatments indicated for RSE. To our knowledge, there is only one other company currently developing a clinical-stage product for the treatment of SE and RSE. Bio-Pharm Solutions Co., a private South Korea-based company, is currently in Phase 2 trials for intravenously administered treatment for SE and RSE.

21



CDD and TSC
There are no drugs other than our product ZTALMY approved specifically for the treatment of seizures associated with CDD, and two drugs approved for the treatment of seizures associated with TSC: Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp.’s Afinitor DISPERZ® (everolimus tablets for oral suspension) and Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s EPIDIOLEX® (cannabidiol). CDD and TSC patients are typically prescribed drugs approved for epileptic seizures, which often fail to control seizures in these patient populations. To our knowledge, there is only one other company with a drug in active clinical development for the treatment of CDD (UCB S.A’s, FINTEPLA® Fenfluramine Hydrochloride). To our knowledge, there are currently two products in development for the treatment of seizures associated with TSC: Noema Pharma AG’s Basimglurant (NOE-101) in a Phase 2b trial and Ovid’s OV329 in a Phase 1A trial.
LGS
There are currently three FDA-approved branded drugs for the treatment of seizures in LGS. These include Assertio Holdings Inc.’s SYMPAZAN® (clobazam) oral film CIV for patients 2+ years old, Jazz Pharmaceutical’s EPIDIOLEX® (cannabidiol) for patients 1+ years old, and UCB S.A’s, FINTEPLA® (Fenfluramine Hydrochloride) for patients 2+ years old. Patients with LGS experience life-long epilepsy and exhibit multiple seizure types that are often refractory to treatment. To our knowledge, there are currently four products in clinical-stage development for the treatment of LGS: Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited’s Soticlestat in Phase 3 trials, SK Life Science, Inc’s Carisbamate in Phase 3 trials, Eisai Inc.’s FYCOMPA® (perampanel) in Phase 3 trials, and Epygenix Therapeutics Inc.’s EPX-100 (clemizole hydrochloride) entering pivotal Phase 2/3 trials.
Manufacturing 
Manufacturing of drugs and product candidates, including ganaxolone, must comply with FDA current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) regulations. Ganaxolone is a synthetic small molecule made through a series of organic chemistry steps starting with commercially available organic chemical raw materials. We conduct manufacturing activities under individual purchase orders with independent contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) to supply our clinical trials. We have executed commercial supply agreements for ganaxolone API with our current manufacturer and also with our current supplier for finished bulk drug product. Additionally, we have executed a master supply agreement with a second API supplier in the U.S. to undertake certain process development activities and subsequently to provide commercial supplies of API and/or API intermediates. We have an internal quality program and have qualified and signed quality agreements with our major CMOs. We conduct periodic quality audits of their facilities. We believe that our existing suppliers of ganaxolone’s API and finished product will be capable of providing sufficient quantities of each to meet our clinical trial supply needs. We also believe our current API manufacturer will be able to meet our currently forecasted commercial needs for ZTALMY for at least the next three years. CMOs may be used in the future for clinical supplies and commercial manufacturing. 
Ganaxolone Formulations
The therapeutic possibilities of ganaxolone have been understood for some time; however, because ganaxolone is a high-dose water insoluble compound, developing a formulation that could provide consistent drug exposure and could be manufactured at a commercially feasible cost had proven challenging. We believe our patented nanoparticulate formulation and novel manufacturing process for ganaxolone can successfully address the cost of manufacturing and pharmacokinetic challenges that previously encumbered the clinical and commercial feasibility of ganaxolone. 
Ganaxolone is currently formulated for oral and IV administration. In addition, we are evaluating various formulation approaches to improve ganaxolone’s oral drug properties.
Commercial Operations
In connection with the commercialization of ZTAMLY, our first FDA approved product, we have built a commercial operations infrastructure, including, marketing infrastructure, market access capabilities, and sales field 

22



force to reach high prescribing neurologists, critical care, epilepsy specialists and other target physician populations in the U.S. ZTALMY is regulated by the DEA as a controlled substance under the CSA as a schedule V drug. ZTALMY became available for commercial sale and shipment to patients with a prescription in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2022. We believe a focused sales and marketing organization could be leveraged to market ganaxolone across multiple epilepsy indications. We believe that there could also be significant market opportunities for ganaxolone in epilepsy and other neurological and psychiatric conditions outside of the U.S. In order to capitalize on such opportunities, we have entered into collaborations and plan to seek additional collaborations with pharmaceutical companies that have greater reach and resources by virtue of their size and experience in the field. 
​
Government Regulation
As a pharmaceutical company that operates in the U.S., we are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDC Act) and its implementing regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for the research, testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, packaging, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, advertising and promotion of our products. Although the discussion below focuses on regulation in the U.S., we anticipate seeking approval for, and marketing of, our product candidates in other countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the U.S., although there can be important differences. In addition, some significant aspects of regulation in the European Union (EU) are addressed in a centralized way through the European Medicines Agency (EMA), but country-specific regulation also remains in many essential respects. The process of obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations will require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources in order to be successful.
United States Government Regulation
The FDA is the main agency that regulates pharmaceuticals in the U.S., and its regulatory authority is based in the FDC Act. Pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes. A failure to comply with applicable requirements during the product development, approval, or post-approval periods may lead to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the imposition by the FDA or an institutional review board (IRB) of a hold on clinical trials, refusal to approve pending marketing applications or supplements, withdrawal of approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
The steps required before a new drug may be marketed in the U.S. generally include:

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice (GLP) regulations, as applicable, including pharmacology and formulation studies to develop detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing and controls;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) to support human clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an IRB at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with federal regulations, including requirements for good clinical practices (GCP) to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product candidate for each targeted indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission of a new drug application (NDA) to the FDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of clinical trial sites to ensure compliance with GCP, if applicable;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

23




● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the investigational product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
Clinical Trials
An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product candidate to humans. A 30-day waiting period after the initial submission of an IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has not raised concerns or questions about the proposed clinical testing and placed the IND on clinical hold within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may initiate. If an IND has been placed on clinical hold, the sponsor must resolve the FDA’s outstanding concerns or questions before clinical trials can begin.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP, which are requirements meant to protect the rights and health of subjects and to assure the quality, reliability and integrity of data collected in clinical trials. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols that detail, among other things, the subject inclusion and exclusion criteria, the dosing regimen, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. subjects and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. The informed written consent of each participating subject is required, and an IRB at each site where the trial is conducted must approve the trial. The IRB must monitor the trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the registration of ongoing clinical trials and the reporting of clinical trial results to public registries.
The clinical investigation of an investigational product candidate is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The three phases of an investigation are as follows:

● | Phase 1. Phase 1 includes the initial introduction of an investigational product candidate into humans. Phase 1 trials generally are conducted in healthy volunteers but in some cases are conducted in patients with the target disease or condition. These trials are designed to evaluate the safety, metabolism, PKs and pharmacologic actions of the investigational product candidate in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1 trials, sufficient information about the investigational product candidate’s PKs and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of Phase 2 trials. The total number of participants included in Phase 1 trials varies but is generally in the range of 20 to 80. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2. Phase 2 includes the controlled clinical trials conducted in patients with the target disease or condition, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the product candidate, and to obtain initial evidence of the effectiveness of the investigational product candidate for a particular indication. Phase 2 trials are typically well-controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a limited subject population, usually involving no more than several hundred participants. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3. Phase 3 trials are controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded subject population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the investigational product candidate has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the product candidate, and to provide an adequate basis for drug approval. Phase 3 trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand participants. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

24




controlled Phase 3 trials to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the drug; however, the FDA may find a single Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence to be sufficient in rare instances, particularly in an area of significant unmet medical need and if the trial design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 4. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials after approval to gain more information about the product. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clinical trials may not be completed successfully within a specified period of time, if at all. The decision to terminate development of an investigational product candidate may be made by either a health authority, such as the FDA, or IRB/ethics committees, or by a company for various reasons. The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial, which is referred to as a clinical hold, at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. In some cases, clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data monitoring committee or data safety monitoring board. Such a group provides recommendations to the sponsor for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points, based on limited access to data from the ongoing trial. The suspension or termination of development can occur during any phase of clinical trials if it is determined that the participants or subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. In addition, there are requirements for the registration of ongoing clinical trials of product candidates on public registries and the disclosure of certain clinical trial results and other trial information after completion.
A sponsor may be able to request a special protocol assessment (SPA) the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the design and size of certain clinical trials or animal studies that will adequately address scientific and/or regulatory requirements that could support marketing approval. A sponsor may make a specific request for an SPA and provide information regarding the design and size of the proposed clinical trial. An SPA request must be made before the proposed trial begins, and all open issues must be resolved before the trial begins. If a written agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the regulatory record. The agreement will be binding on the FDA and may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the product candidate was identified after the testing began. An SPA is not binding if new circumstances arise, and there is no guarantee that a trial will ultimately be adequate to support an approval even if the trial is subject to an SPA.
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational product candidate information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA to request marketing approval for the product in specified indications.
New Drug Applications
In order to obtain approval to market a drug in the U.S., a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for the proposed indication. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational product candidate to the satisfaction of the FDA.
In most cases, the NDA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee; there may be some instances in which the user fee is waived. The FDA will initially review the NDA for completeness before it accepts the NDA for filing. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. After the NDA 

25



submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Applications for standard review product candidates are reviewed within ten months of FDA’s acceptance for filing. An accelerated six-month review can be given to applications that meet certain criteria. The FDA can extend the review period by three months, or potentially longer, to consider certain late-submitted information or information intended to clarify information provided in the initial submission. The FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP. FDA Advisory Committee meetings are often held for New Chemical Entities (NCEs), novel indications, or for applications that otherwise present scientific, technical, or policy questions on which the agency believes it would benefit from the perspectives of outside experts. An advisory committee meeting includes a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, who review, evaluate and make a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (ETASU). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and prior FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
Compounds that have a potential for dependence and abuse are scheduled as controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act and similar state and foreign laws. In the U.S., for new chemical entities under development for therapeutic use, FDA and HHS complete an analysis and recommendation about whether a drug should be scheduled as a controlled substance, and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) takes the analysis and recommendation into account in the scheduling process. In the case of a new drug approved by the FDA, if scheduling is warranted then the DEA issues an interim final rule controlling the drug 90 days after receipt of the FDA/HHS analysis and recommendation or notice of FDA approval of the drug, whichever is later. Drugs that are scheduled as controlled substances are subject to stringent regulatory requirements, including requirements for registering manufacturing and distribution facilities, security controls and employee screening, recordkeeping, reporting, product labeling and packaging, import and export. There are five federal schedules for controlled substances, known as Schedule I, II, III, IV and V. The regulatory requirements that apply to a drug vary depending on the particular controlled substance schedule into which a drug is placed, based on consideration of a number of factors, including its potential for dependence and 

26



abuse. Schedules I and II contain the most stringent restrictions and requirements, and Schedule V the least. For all controlled substances, there are potential criminal and civil penalties that apply for the failure to meet applicable legal requirements, and healthcare professionals must have a DEA license in order to handle, prescribe, or dispense controlled substances.
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
In the U.S., the FDA may grant breakthrough therapy designation to a drug candidate if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the therapy may offer substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint over existing options for patients with a serious condition. Features of breakthrough therapy designation include intensive guidance to ensure that the design of clinical trials are as efficient as practicable, increased involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff and where appropriate, a cross-disciplinary project lead assigned to the FDA review team, and rolling review of the NDA. Breakthrough designation can be requested with the IND or ideally no later than the end-of-Phase 2 meeting. 
Fast Track Designation 
Fast Track is a designation by the FDA of an investigational drug that is intended to treat a serious condition and for which nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need. The request for fast track designation can be initiated with the IND or ideally no later than the pre-NDA/BLA meeting. Features of fast track designation include more frequent meetings and interactions with FDA to expedite development and review, including to discuss the drug’s development plan and ensure collection of appropriate data needed to support drug approval, and a rolling review of the NDA/BLA. 
Priority Review
Based on results of the Phase 3 clinical trials submitted in an NDA, upon the request of an applicant, a priority review designation may be granted to a product by the FDA, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months from FDA acceptance for filing. Priority review may be granted where a product is intended to treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of the serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the standard FDA review period is ten months from FDA acceptance for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.

Post-Approval Regulation
After regulatory approval of a drug is obtained, a sponsor is required to comply with several post-approval requirements. For example, as a condition of approval of an NDA, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. In addition, as a holder of an approved NDA, a sponsor is required to report adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information, submit annual reports and comply with advertising and promotional labeling requirements. Additionally, any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act and the Drug Supply Chain Security Act. 
Manufacturing must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP. Compliance with cGMP includes adhering to requirements relating to organization and training of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, quality control and quality assurance, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, and records and reports. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose manufacturing documentation requirements. Accordingly, sponsors must continue to expend time, money and effort to maintain quality control and compliance with cGMP. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on 

27



third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of ganaxolone. The FDA also conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities, and processes following the initial approval of a product. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may lead to the FDA taking enforcement actions or seeking sanctions, including fines, issuance of warning letters, civil penalties, injunctions, suspension of manufacturing operations, operating restrictions, withdrawal of FDA approval, seizure or recall of products, and criminal prosecution. Although we periodically monitor the FDA compliance of our third-party manufacturers, we cannot be certain that our present or future third-party manufacturers will consistently comply with cGMP and other applicable FDA regulatory requirements.
The FDA and other federal regulatory agencies closely regulate the marketing and promotion of drugs through, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. A product cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved. After approval, product promotion can include only those claims relating to safety and effectiveness that are consistent with the labeling approved by the FDA. Healthcare providers are permitted to prescribe drugs for “off-label” uses—that is, uses not approved by the FDA and therefore not described in the drug’s labeling—because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label uses. In general, a manufacturer may not promote a drug for off-label use, but may engage in non-promotional, balanced communication regarding off-label use under specified conditions. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) or the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS OIG), as well as state authorities. Enforcement action could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products.
NDA holders must comply with other regulatory requirements, including submitting annual reports, reporting information about adverse drug experiences, and maintaining certain records.
Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings, contraindications, or limitations of use, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDC Act
Orange Book Listing
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be referenced by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or 505(b)(2) application. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients, generally in the same strengths and dosage form, as a referenced listed drug (RLD) and has been shown through PK testing to be bioequivalent to the RLD. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are generally not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical studies or clinical trials to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. 505(b)(2) applications provide for marketing of a drug product that may have the same active ingredients as the reference drug and contains full safety and effectiveness data, but at least some of this information comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and to which the applicant does not have a right of reference. Drugs approved through an ANDA are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the RLD, depending on applicable state laws. 

28



The ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant may also elect to submit a statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding a patented method of use or use covered by regulatory exclusivity. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents by filing a certification that the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earliest of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the reference product has expired.
Marketing Exclusivity
Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approve any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug. Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert, are associated with a three-year period of exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change. An ANDA may be submitted one year before five-year marketing exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. In this case, the 30-month stay, if applicable, runs from the end of the five-year marketing exclusivity period. 

In the European Economic Area (EEA), which is comprised of twenty-seven Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after a related Marketing Authorization (MA) has been granted. MA for medicinal products can be obtained through several different procedures. These procedures include a centralized, mutual recognition procedure, decentralized procedure, or national procedure (if marketing authorization is sought for a single EU Member State). The centralized procedure allows a company to submit a single application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). If a related positive opinion is provided by the EMA, the European Commission will grant a centralized marketing authorization that is valid in all twenty-seven EU Member States and three of the four European Free Trade Association countries (Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein) all of whom are part of the EEA.

The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance that is not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or for which a grant of centralized marketing authorization is in the interest of patients at EU level within the EU.



In the EU, a medicinal product containing a new active substance, which has never been approved in a medicinal product in the EU before, as well as in certain other circumstances, is entitled to eight years of data exclusivity and ten years of market exclusivity following a grant of MA. During the first eight years, no generic company may refer to the data used by the innovator to obtain a marketing authorization. After eight years, generics may reference the innovator data, but generic medicinal products may only be placed on the market after a total of ten years. Approval of a new indication will not result in a separate additional period of regulatory data protection and market exclusivity. If, 

29



however, during the first eight years after initial marketing authorization, a new indication is approved which is considered by the competent authorities to be of significant clinical benefit in comparison to existing therapies, this would result in one additional year of market exclusivity, in addition to the initial eight plus two years. Such significant clinical benefit would generally have to be supported by comparative clinical trials.
Patent Term Extension
After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five year patent extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase—the time between an effective IND and NDA submission—and all of the review phase—the time between NDA submission and approval, up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years.
Many other countries also provide for patent term extensions or similar extensions of patent protection for pharmaceutical products. For example, in Japan, it may be possible to extend the patent term for up to five years and in the EU, it may be possible to obtain a supplementary protection certificate that would effectively extend patent protection for up to five years.
In the EU, if pediatric studies are conducted in accordance with a pediatric investigation plan that was previously agreed upon with the EMA, it may be possible to obtain an extension of a supplementary protection certificate of up to six months. This pediatric extension would not be available if the product is an orphan medicinal product. The extension would also not be available if one additional year of market exclusivity was granted for a new pediatric indication on the basis of the results of pediatric studies conducted in compliance with an agreed pediatric investigation plan.

Orphan Drug Designation
The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or, if the disease or condition affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug would be recovered from sales in the U.S. In the EU, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products assesses applications for orphan designations after which the European Commission may grant orphan drug designation. In the EU, orphan designation is granted if it is established that a medicinal product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU. In addition, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life- threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug. In order to obtain orphan designation in the EU, it must be established that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in the EU or if such method exists, that the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.
In the U.S., orphan drug designation may confer eligibility for financial incentives, such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax credits for certain research and user fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to seven years of market exclusivity. The FDA has interpreted the statutory provisions for orphan drug exclusivity to mean that the FDA may not approve any other application for the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition.


In the EU, orphan drug designation may be granted to drugs that can be used to treat life-threatening diseases or chronically debilitating conditions with an incidence of no more than five in 10,000 people or, for economic reasons, would be unlikely to be developed without incentives. Orphan drug designation also entitles an applicant for MA to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers, and protocol assistance, a type of scientific advice specific 

30



for designated orphan medicinal products. Following a grant of MA, the product is entitled to ten years of exclusivity if the product continues to be designated as an orphan medical product upon grant of the marketing authorization. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is not sufficiently profitable to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. During the orphan exclusivity period, the competent authorities in the EU may not accept a marketing authorization application for a similar medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product (i.e., a medicinal product with an identical active substance, or an active substance with the same principal molecular structural features and which acts via the same mechanism) with the same orphan indication during the ten-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this latter product is demonstrated to be safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product.
In the EU, if pediatric studies are conducted in accordance with a pediatric investigation plan that was previously agreed upon with the European Medicines Agency, it may be possible to obtain an extension of orphan market exclusivity of two years, resulting in a total orphan market exclusivity period of twelve years.
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submission of an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not change the scientific/medical standards for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval, or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
Controlled Substances 
The federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (CSA) and its implementing regulations establish a “closed system” of regulations for controlled substances. The CSA imposes registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting, storage, manufacturing, distribution, importation and other requirements under the oversight of the DEA. The DEA is the federal agency responsible for regulating controlled substances, and requires those individuals or entities that manufacture, import, export, distribute, research, or dispense controlled substances to comply with the regulatory requirements in order to prevent the diversion of controlled substances to illicit channels of commerce.
The DEA categorizes controlled substances into one of five schedules — Schedule I, II, III, IV or V — with varying qualifications for listing in each schedule. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse, have no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the U.S. and lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision. Pharmaceutical products having a currently accepted medical use that are otherwise approved for marketing may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule II substances presenting the highest potential for abuse and physical or psychological dependence, and Schedule V substances presenting the lowest relative potential for abuse and dependence.
Facilities that manufacture, distribute, import or export any controlled substance must register annually with the DEA. The DEA registration is specific to the particular location, activity(ies) and controlled substance schedule(s). For example, separate registrations are required for importation and manufacturing activities, and each registration authorizes which schedules of controlled substances the registrant may handle. However, certain coincident activities are permitted without obtaining a separate DEA registration, such as distribution of controlled substances by the manufacturer that produces them.
The DEA inspects all manufacturing facilities to review security, recordkeeping, reporting and handling prior to issuing a controlled substance registration. The specific security requirements vary by the type of business activity and the schedule and quantity of controlled substances handled. The most stringent requirements apply to manufacturers of Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures commonly include background checks on employees and physical control of controlled substances through storage in approved vaults, safes and cages, and thorough use of alarm systems and surveillance cameras. Registrants must also report any controlled substance thefts or significant losses, and must comply with CSA and DEA regulatory requirements to destroy or dispose of controlled substances.

31



The states also maintain separate controlled substance laws and regulations, including licensing, recordkeeping, security, distribution, and dispensing requirements. State authorities, including Boards of Pharmacy, regulate use of controlled substances in each state. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with accounting provisions requiring such companies to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
European and Other International Government Regulation
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. We must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Some countries outside of the U.S. have a similar process that requires the submission of a request for a clinical trial authorization (CTA) much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a request for a CTA must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA request is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. The conduct of a clinical trial in the EU must comply with regulatory requirements based on the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC (Clinical Trials Directive), the details of which may vary per EU Member State. On January 31, 2022, the EU Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 (Clinical Trials Regulation) came into effect. The Clinical Trials Regulation applies to clinical trials in all countries of the European Economic Area (EEA, i.e. the EU Member States plus Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein). The Clinical Trials Regulation allows investigators to start and conduct a clinical trial in accordance with the Clinical Trials Directive during a transitional period of one year after the application date (i.e. January 31, 2022). Clinical trials that were authorized under the current Clinical Trials Directive before January 31, 2023 can continue to be conducted under the Clinical Trials Directive until January 31, 2025. An application to transition ongoing trials from the current Clinical Trials Directive to the new Clinical Trials Regulation will need to be submitted and authorized in time before the end of the transitional period. The new Clinical Trials Regulation is intended to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EEA. The main characteristics of the regulation include: (i) a streamlined application procedure through a single entry point known as the “EU portal”; (ii) a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and (iii) a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts.
In addition, when conducting a clinical trial in the EU, the processing of personal data, including pseudonymized data, must comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR imposes strict obligations on the processing of personal data, including relating to the transfer of personal data to third countries such as the US. The competent authorities of the EU Member States may impose significant financial penalties in the event of violation of the GDPR.
To obtain regulatory approval to commercialize a new drug under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application (MAA). MAAs can be submitted to the EMA through a centralized procedure, resulting in one marketing authorization valid throughout the EU (27 EU Member States as well as in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain products, such as orphan medicinal products or products with a new active substance for certain therapeutic indications and is optional for certain other 

32



products, such as products that contain a new active substance that has not previously been approved in a medicinal product in the EU. Alternative MAA routes in the EU are the decentralized procedure in which it is possible to request marketing authorization in a selection of various EU Member States, the national procedure in which a marketing authorization is requested for one EU Member State only or the mutual recognition procedure in which marketing authorization in one or more EU Member States is requested on the basis of a prior marketing authorization in another EU Member State.
For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Russia, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Internationally, clinical trials are generally required to be conducted in accordance with GCP, applicable regulatory requirements of each jurisdiction and the medical ethics principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Small Medium Enterprise (SME) designation 
In the EU, small medium enterprise designation (SME) can be granted to non-subsidiary, independent firms which employ fewer than 250 employees to promote innovation and the development of new medicinal products by smaller companies. The criteria for designation are dependent on staff headcount, either turnover or balance sheet total and the ownership structure, including any partnership or linkage.  Benefits of SME designation include direct assistance on regulatory aspects of the pharmaceutical legislation, help navigating the array of services available, fee exemptions and reductions for pre- and post-authorization regulatory procedures, assistance with translations of product information into all official EU languages, guidance on clinical data publication and a free redaction tool license, liaison with academic investigators in pediatric-medicine research through the European Network of Pediatric Research at the EMA and workshops and training sessions. In 2021, we renewed our SME designation in the EU.
Compliance
During all phases of development (pre- and post-marketing), failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s imposition of a clinical hold on trials, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Accelerated Review (EU)
Under the Centralized Procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA is 210 days (excluding “clock stops,” when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP)). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, such as when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, which should be justified on a case-by-case basis. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days upon submission of an MAA.
Healthcare Reform
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended (Affordable Care Act), has substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act has impacted pre-existing government healthcare programs and resulted in the development of new programs. For example, the Affordable Care Act provides for Medicare payments for performance initiatives and improvements to Medicare physician quality reporting system and feedback program.

33



Among the Affordable Care Act’s provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:

● | an annual, nondeductible fee on any covered entity engaged in manufacturing or importing certain branded prescription drugs and biological products, apportioned among such entities in accordance with their respective market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, retroactive to January 1, 2010, to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price (AMP), for most branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act (FCA) and the Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS), new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a new prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients (Medicare Part D), coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70.0% (as of January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D (the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) replaces the coverage gap discount program with a new manufacturer discount program beginning in 2025);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered outpatient drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals beginning in 2014 and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133.0% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expansion of the types of entities eligible for participation in and discounts under the Public Health Service 340B drug pricing program;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | new requirements to report annually specified financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, as defined in the Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations, including reporting any “payments or transfers of value” made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, and reporting any ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations during the preceding calendar year, with data collection to be required beginning August 1, 2013 and reporting to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), to be required by March 31, 2014, and by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a mandatory nondeductible payment for employers with 50 or more full-time employees (or equivalents) who fail to provide certain minimum health insurance coverage for such employees and their dependents, beginning in 2016.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act have been subject to judicial challenges as well as efforts to modify them or to alter their interpretation and implementation. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act), enacted on December 22, 2017, eliminated the tax-based shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to 

34



maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, commonly referred to as the “individual mandate,” effective January 1, 2019. Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes, and judicial challenges related to the Affordable Care Act remain possible. It is unclear how the Affordable Care Act and its implementation, as well as efforts to modify the Affordable Care Act, its implementing regulations, or portions thereof, will affect our business.

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction, which triggered the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to healthcare providers of, on average, 2.0% per fiscal year, starting in 2013 and continuing through 2031. Sequestration is currently set at 2% and will increase to 2.25% for the first half of fiscal year 2030, to 3% for the second half of fiscal year 2030, and to 4% for the remainder of the sequestration period that lasts through the first six months of fiscal year 2031. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several categories of healthcare providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations.

Further, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the IRA which, among other things, establishes a Medicare Part B inflation rebate scheme, under which, generally speaking, manufacturers will owe rebates if the average sales price of a Part B drug increases faster than the pace of inflation. Failure to timely pay a Part B inflation rebate is subject to a civil monetary penalty. The IRA also establishes a Medicare Part D inflation rebate scheme, under which generally speaking manufacturers will owe rebates if the average manufacturer price of a Part D drug increases faster than the pace of inflation. Failure to timely pay a Part D inflation rebate is subject to a civil monetary penalty. The IRA also creates a drug price negotiation program under which the prices for Medicare units of certain high Medicare spend drugs and biologics without generic or biosimilar competition will be capped by reference to, among other things, a specified non-federal average manufacturer price, starting in 2026. Failure to comply with requirements under the drug price negotiation program is subject to an excise tax and/or a civil monetary penalty. The IRA further makes changes to the Medicare Part D benefit, including a limit on annual out-of-pocket costs, and a change in manufacturer liability under the program which could negatively affect the profitability of our product candidates. Failure to pay a discount under this new program will be subject to a civil monetary penalty. Congress continues to examine various policy proposals that may result in pressure on the prices of prescription drugs in the government health benefit programs. The IRA or other legislative changes could impact the market conditions for our product candidates.
We anticipate that the Affordable Care Act and other healthcare reform measures, including those enacted in the future, will result in additional downward pressure on coverage and the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. In addition, it is possible that there will be further state and federal healthcare reform measures adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that state and federal governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S. and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the drug product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and 

35



examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Ganaxolone may not be considered by payers to be medically necessary or cost-effective for particular diseases or conditions. A payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
In addition, Medicare Part D and further legislation may limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the product candidates that we are developing. While government payment pursuant to Medicare Part D for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval, to obtain payments under this program, we would be required to sell products to Medicare recipients through prescription drug plans operating pursuant to this legislation. These plans typically negotiate discounted prices for our products. Federal, state and local governments in the U.S. continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. The IRA has made a number of changes to the Part D program, set to take effect in 2024 and 2025.
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed upon. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become more intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. The EU provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. We may face competition for ganaxolone from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time.
Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS) prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration (i.e., anything of value), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return either for the referral of an individual for, or for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common business arrangements and activities from prosecution or regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from AKS liability. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational and research grants, 

36



charitable donations, product support and patient assistance programs. The regulatory safe harbors also are subject to regulatory revision and interpretation by a number of government agencies. Liability under the AKS may be established without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act (discussed below). Violations of the AKS are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, damages, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.




The federal civil False Claims Act (FCA) prohibits any person from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Actions under the FCA may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Such private individuals may share in amounts paid by the entity to the government in recovery or settlement. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. FCA liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and significant mandatory penalties per false or fraudulent claim or statement for violations, as well as exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claims laws, including, among others, federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non-government health benefit programs.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations (collectively, HIPAA) imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry, in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. As of 2022, applicable manufacturers are required to report information regarding payments and transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives.
Also, many states have analogous fraud and abuse statutes or regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. Other state laws require posting of information relating to clinical trials and their outcomes. Some states restrict the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs. Other states require identification or licensing of sales representatives. 
In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA imposes privacy and security obligations on covered entity health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses, as well as their “business associates”—certain persons or 

37



entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a specified service or performing a function on behalf of a covered entity. We may obtain health information from third parties (including research institutions from which we obtain clinical trial data) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA and other privacy and data security and consumer protection laws. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA, other than potentially with respect to providing certain employee benefits, we could potentially be subject to criminal penalties if we, our affiliates, or our agents knowingly receive individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA, and subject to other civil and/or criminal penalties if we obtain, use, or disclose information in a manner not permitted by other privacy and data security and consumer protection laws. In addition, numerous other federal and state laws and regulations govern privacy and security, including state data breach notification laws, state health information and/or genetic privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)), many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Compliance with these laws is difficult, constantly evolving, time consuming, and requires a flexible privacy framework and substantial resources. Compliance efforts will likely be an increasing and substantial cost in the future. Federal regulators, state attorneys general, and plaintiffs’ attorneys have been and will likely continue to be active in this space.
In California, the CCPA establishes certain requirements for data use and sharing transparency and creates new data privacy rights for California consumers. The CCPA and its implementing regulations have already been amended multiple times since their enactment, including by the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA. The CPRA introduced significant amendments to the CCPA and established and funded a dedicated California privacy regulator, the California Privacy Protection Agency, or CPPA. The amendments introduced by the CPRA went into effect on January 1, 2023, and new implementing regulations are expected to be introduced by the CPPA. Failure to comply with the CCPA may result in, among other things, significant civil penalties and injunctive relief, or statutory or actual damages. In addition, California residents have the right to bring a private right of action in connection with certain types of incidents. These claims may result in significant liability and damages. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and may impose limitations on our activities or otherwise adversely affect our business. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the EU, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. For example, other states, including Virginia, Colorado, Utah, and Connecticut have enacted privacy laws similar to the CCPA that impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business and we continue to assess the impact of these state legislation, on our business as additional information and guidance becomes available. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services and research activities. These laws and regulations, as well as any associated claims, inquiries, or investigations or any other government actions may lead to unfavorable outcomes including increased compliance costs, delays or impediments in the development of new products, negative publicity, increased operating costs, diversion of management time and attention, and remedies that harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.
The EU, EEA countries and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. The GDPR is directly applicable in each EEA country. The GDPR imposes strict restrictions and obligations on companies’ ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data or otherwise process personal data, especially if they process sensitive personal data (such as data concerning patient health), including significant fines for non-compliance with the GDPR. Implementation of the GDPR has influenced other jurisdictions to either amend or propose legislation to amend their existing data privacy and cybersecurity laws to resemble the requirements of GDPR.
With regard to transfer of personal data, the GDPR restricts the ability of companies to transfer personal data from the EEA to the U.S. and other countries, which may adversely affect our ability to transfer personal data or otherwise may cause us to incur significant costs to come into compliance with applicable data transfer impact assessments and implementation of legal data transfer mechanisms. One mechanism previously relied upon by U.S. companies for such transfers was the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, or Privacy Shield. However, in July 2020, the European Court of Justice ruled the Privacy Shield to be an invalid data transfer mechanism and confirmed that the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses, or the Model Clauses, remain valid and in June 2021, the 

38



European Commission published updated versions of the Model Clauses, which must be incorporated into new and existing agreements within prescribed timeframes in order to continue to lawfully transfer personal data outside of the EU. As a result, companies may no longer rely on the Privacy Shield as a basis on which to transfer personal data from the EU to the U.S. U.S.-based companies are permitted to rely on other authorized means and procedures to transfer personal data provided by the GDPR. The Model Clauses may also come under increased scrutiny as a result of the European Court of Justice’s judgement in July 2020, though they remain the most common authorized procedure to transfer personal data out of the EU. On December, 13 2022, the European Commission adopted a draft adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. This draft decision follows the signature of a US Executive Order by President Biden on October, 7 2022, along with the regulations issued by the US Attorney General Merrick Garland. These two instruments implemented into U.S. law the agreement in principle announced by President von der Leyen and President Biden in March 2022. The draft adequacy decision, which reflects the assessment by the European Commission of the U.S. legal framework has now been published and transmitted to the European Data Protection Board, or EDPB, for its opinion. The draft decision concludes that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the EU to U.S. companies. The draft adequacy decision text will also have to be approved by a committee composed of representatives of the EU Member States and the European Parliament can exercise its right of scrutiny. After this process, the European Commission is then expected to adopt the final adequacy decision, which will allow data to flow freely from the EU to the U.S. After one year from the notification date of the adequacy decision to the Member States and subsequently at least every four years, the European Commission will carry out a new evaluation and could conclude that an adequate level of protection is no longer ensured and decide to suspend, amend or repeal the adequacy decision, or limit its scope.
In addition to the foregoing requirements, we have certain price reporting obligations to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, we are required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds made available to states for our drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Those rebates are based on pricing data that we report on a monthly and quarterly basis to CMS, the federal agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid Drug Rebate Programs. These data include the average manufacturer price and, in the case of innovator products, the best price for each drug which, in general, represents the lowest price available from the manufacturer to any entity in the U.S. in any pricing structure, calculated to include all sales and associated rebates, discounts and other price concessions, subject to certain exclusions. The Affordable Care Act made significant changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, and CMS issued a final regulation, which became effective on April 1, 2016, to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program under the Affordable Care Act. On December 21, 2020, CMS issued a final regulation that (i) modified existing Medicaid Drug Rebate Program regulations to permit reporting multiple best price figures with regard to value-based purchasing arrangements and (ii) provided definitions for “line extension,” “new formulation,” and related terms with the practical effect of expanding the scope of drugs considered to be line extensions, with such changes taking effect in 2022. Our failure to comply with the aforementioned price reporting and rebate payment obligations, as well as pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) “accumulator” programs, could negatively impact our financial results. In addition, statutory and regulatory changes or other agency action regarding the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program could negatively affect our financial results or expand our rebate liability. 
Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program also participate in the 340B program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program, which is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The Affordable Care Act expanded the list of covered entities to include certain free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals, but exempts “orphan drugs” from the ceiling price requirements for these covered entities. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula based on the average manufacturer price and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, and in general, products subject to Medicaid price reporting and rebate liability are also subject to the 340B ceiling price calculation and discount requirement. Any additional future changes to the definition of average manufacturer price and the Medicaid rebate 

39



amount under the Affordable Care Act or other legislation or regulation could affect our 340B ceiling price calculations and negatively impact our results of operations if we successfully commercialize one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval. 

HRSA issued a final regulation, effective January 1, 2019, regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities. HRSA also has implemented a ceiling price reporting requirement, pursuant to which manufacturers must report the 340B ceiling prices for their covered outpatient drugs to HRSA on a quarterly basis. HRSA then publishes those prices to 340B covered entities. Moreover, under a final regulation effective January 13, 2021, HRSA newly established an administrative dispute resolution (ADR) process for claims by covered entities that a manufacturer has engaged in overcharging, and by manufacturers that a covered entity violated the prohibitions against diversion or duplicate discounts. Such claims are to be resolved through an ADR panel of government officials rendering a decision that could be appealed only in federal court. An ADR proceeding could subject a manufacturer to onerous procedural requirements and could result in additional liability. In addition, changes to legislation, regulations, or guidance could modify 340B program compliance or expand discount liability.
Federal law also requires that a company report average sales price information each quarter to CMS for certain categories of drugs that are payable under the Medicare Part B program. Manufacturers calculate the average sales price based on a statutorily defined formula as well as regulations and interpretations of the statute by CMS. CMS uses these submissions to determine payment rates for drugs under Medicare Part B. Beginning in 2023, manufacturers must pay refunds to Medicare for single source drugs or biologics, or biosimilar biological products, reimbursed under Medicare Part B and packaged in single-dose containers or single-use packages, for units of discarded drug reimbursed by Medicare Part B in excess of 10% of total allowed charges under Medicare Part B for that drug (or a percentage established for drugs with unique circumstances). Manufacturers that fail to pay refunds could be subject to civil monetary penalties of 125% of the refund amount. The IRA establishes a Medicare Part B inflation rebate scheme, under which, generally speaking, manufacturers will owe rebates if the average sales price of a Part B drug increases faster than the pace of inflation. Failure to timely pay a Part B inflation rebate is subject to a civil monetary penalty.
In addition, manufacturers are required to provide to CMS a 70% discount on brand name prescription drugs utilized by Medicare Part D beneficiaries when those beneficiaries are in the coverage gap phase of the Part D benefit design. The IRA replaces the coverage gap discount program with a new manufacturer discount program beginning in 2025. Under either program, civil monetary penalties could be applied if a manufacturer fails to provide these discounts in the amount of 125% of the discount that was due. Moreover, the IRA also establishes a Medicare Part D inflation rebate scheme, under which, generally speaking, manufacturers will owe rebates if the average manufacturer price of a Part D drug increases faster than the pace of inflation. Failure to timely pay a Part D inflation rebate is subject to a civil monetary penalty.
In order to be eligible to have our products that we successfully commercialize paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, we also would have to participate in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), pricing program. As part of this program, we would be obligated to make our products available for procurement on an FSS contract under which we must comply with standard government terms and conditions and charge a price that is no higher than the statutory Federal Ceiling Price (FCP) to four federal agencies (VA, U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), Public Health Service, and U.S. Coast Guard).
The FCP is based on the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price (Non-FAMP), which we would be required to calculate and report to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. Pursuant to applicable law, knowing provision of false information in connection with a Non-FAMP filing can subject a manufacturer to significant civil monetary penalties for each item of false information. The FSS pricing and contracting obligations also contain extensive disclosure and certification requirements. For additional information regarding obligations under federal health care programs, refer to the risk factor entitled “We participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and if we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under that program or other governmental pricing programs that we participate in, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material

adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In the U.S. our activities are potentially subject to additional regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including CMS, other divisions of HHS (for example, the OIG), the DOJ and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in some states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing specified physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit other specified sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
