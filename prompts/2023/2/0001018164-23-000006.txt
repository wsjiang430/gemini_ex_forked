ITEM 1. BUSINESS
INTRODUCTION
Willis Lease Finance Corporation with its subsidiaries (“WLFC” or the “Company”) is a leading lessor and servicer of commercial aircraft and aircraft engines. Our principal business objective is to build value for our shareholders by acquiring commercial aircraft and engines and managing those assets in order to provide a return on investment, primarily through lease rent and maintenance reserve revenues, as well as through management fees earned for managing assets owned by other parties. As of December 31, 2022, we had $2,111.9 million of equipment held in our operating lease portfolio, $81.4 million of notes receivable, $17.7 million of maintenance rights, and $6.4 million of investments in sales-type leases, which represented 339 engines, 13 aircraft, one marine vessel and other leased parts and equipment with 80 lessees in 41 countries. In addition to our owned portfolio, as of December 31, 2022, we managed a total lease portfolio of 324 engines, aircraft and related equipment for other parties.
Willis Aeronautical Services, Inc. (“Willis Aero”) is a wholly-owned and vertically-integrated subsidiary whose primary focus is the sale of aircraft engine parts and materials through the acquisition or consignment of aircraft and engines. 
Willis Asset Management Limited (“Willis Asset Management”) is a wholly-owned and vertically-integrated subsidiary whose primary focus is the engine management and consulting business. Willis Asset Management had 289 engines, excluding WLFC engines, under management as of December 31, 2022.
We are a Delaware corporation, incorporated in 1998. Our executive offices are located at 4700 Lyons Technology Parkway, Coconut Creek, Florida 33073. We transact business directly and through our subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities (“VIE”) unless otherwise indicated.
We maintain a website at www.willislease.com where our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports are available without charge, as soon as reasonably practicable following the time they are filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The SEC also maintains an electronic Internet site that contains our reports, proxies and information statements, and other information that we file or furnish at http://www.sec.gov.
We separate our business into two reportable segments, Leasing and Related Operations and Spare Parts Sales. Our business activities by reportable segment are described below.
Leasing and Related Operations
Our strategy is to lease aircraft and aircraft engines and provide related services to a diversified group of commercial aircraft operators and maintenance, repair and overhaul organizations (“MROs”) worldwide. Commercial aircraft operators need engines in addition to those installed on the aircraft that they operate. Spare engines are required to support fleet operation during the highly regulated maintenance cycle of aircraft engines. Furthermore, unscheduled events such as mechanical failure, Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) airworthiness directives or manufacturer-recommended actions for maintenance, repair and overhaul of engines result in the need for spare engines.
Our engine portfolio primarily consists of noise-compliant Stage IV commercial jet engines manufactured by CFMI, General Electric, Pratt & Whitney, Rolls Royce and International Aero Engines. These engines generally may be used on one or more aircraft types and are the most widely used engines in the world, powering Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier and Embraer aircraft.
We acquire engines for our leasing portfolio in a number of ways. We enter into sale and lease back transactions with operators of aircraft, original equipment manufacturers of engines, and MROs. We also purchase both new and used engines that are subject to a lease when purchased and on a speculative basis (i.e., without a lease attached from manufacturers or other parties which own such engines).
Total revenues from our Leasing and Related Operations reportable segment was 91.7% and 93.6% of the respective total consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
At December 31, 2022, approximately 72% of our on-lease engines, aircraft, and related equipment (all of which we sometimes refer to as “equipment”) by net book value are leased and operated internationally. Substantially all leases relating to this equipment are denominated and payable in United States (“U.S.”) dollars, which is customary in the industry. Future leases may provide for payments to be made in other foreign currencies. In 2022, we leased our equipment to lessees domiciled in seven geographic regions. 
Spare Parts Sales
Our wholly-owned and vertically-integrated subsidiary Willis Aero primarily engages in the sale of aircraft engine parts and materials through the acquisition or consignment of engines from third parties or from the leasing portfolio. This business segment enables us to provide end-of-life solutions for the growing supply of surplus aircraft and engines, as well as manage the full lifecycle of our lease assets, enhance the returns on our engine portfolio and create incremental value for our shareholders.
COVID-19 Impact 
In January 2022, the Company lifted travel restrictions and subsequently reopened its corporate headquarters and other offices for employees and contractors to work from. The Company has experienced and continues to experience various degrees of disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lower demand for air travel presents significant risks to the Company, resulting in impacts which have adversely affected the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition. The Company is not able to evaluate or foresee the full extent of these impacts at the current time.
The scope and nature of the impact of COVID-19 on the airline industry, and in turn the Company's business, continue to evolve and the outcomes are uncertain. Given the uncertainty in the rapidly changing market and economic conditions related to COVID-19, we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to the Company's business and financial position. The ultimate extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company will depend on future developments, and such effects could exist for an extended period of time.
INDUSTRY BACKGROUND - THE DEMAND FOR LEASED AIRCRAFT ENGINES
Historically, commercial aircraft operators owned rather than leased their spare engines. As engines become more powerful and technically sophisticated, they have also become more expensive to acquire and maintain. In part due to cash constraints on commercial aircraft operators and the costs associated with engine ownership, commercial aircraft operators have become more cost-conscious and now utilize operating leases for a portion of their spare engines. Engine leasing is a specialized business that has evolved into a discrete sector of the commercial aviation market. Participants in this sector need access to capital, as well as specialized technical knowledge, in order to compete successfully.
Growth in the spare engine leasing industry is dependent on two fundamental drivers:
•the number of commercial aircraft, and therefore engines, in the market; and
•the proportion of engines that are leased, rather than owned, by commercial aircraft operators.
While COVID-19 has significantly impacted engine leasing, we still believe that engine leasing will gradually increase over the long term, but at a slower and less predictable pace than historically, as we emerge from the pandemic.
Increased number of aircraft, and therefore engines, in the market
We believe that the number of commercial and cargo aircraft, and hence spare engines, will increase. Boeing projects 2.8% annual growth in the global commercial jet fleet, increasing the current fleet to over 47,080 aircraft by 2041. Aircraft equipment manufacturers have predicted such an increase in aircraft to address the rapid growth of both passenger and cargo traffic in the Asian markets, as well as demand for new aircraft in more mature markets. While we believe these predictions are accurate over the long term, COVID-19 has materially disrupted the airline industry and significantly slowed down passenger growth globally, including in the U.S., and we believe such growth and demand may be negatively impacted over the short to medium term. See “Risk Factors” below.
Increased lease penetration rate
Spare engines provide support for installed engines in the event of routine or other engine maintenance or unscheduled removal. The number of spare engines needed to service any fleet is determined by many factors. These factors include:
•the number and type of aircraft in an aircraft operator’s fleet;
•the geographic scope of such aircraft operator’s destinations;
•the time an engine is on-wing between removals;
•average shop visit time; and
•the number of spare engines an aircraft operator requires in order to ensure coverage for predicted and unscheduled removals.
We believe that commercial aircraft operators are increasingly considering their spare engines as significant capital assets, in which operating leases may be more attractive than finance leases or ownership of spare engines. Industry analysts have forecasted that the percentage of leased engines is likely to increase over the next 15 years as engine leasing follows the growth of aircraft leasing. We believe this is due to the increasing cost of newer engines, the anticipated modernization of the worldwide aircraft fleet and the significant cost associated therewith, and the emergence of new niche-focused airlines which generally use leasing in order to obtain their capital assets.
ENGINE LEASING
As of December 31, 2022, the majority of our leases to air carriers, manufacturers and MROs were operating leases with the exception of certain failed sale-leaseback transactions classified as notes receivable under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842 and investments in sales-type leases. Under operating leases, we retain the potential benefit and assume the risk of the residual value of the equipment, in contrast to finance leases in which the lessee has more of the potential benefits and risks of ownership. Operating leases allow commercial aircraft operators greater fleet and financial flexibility due to the relatively small initial capital outlay necessary to obtain use of the aircraft equipment, and the availability of short- and long-term leases to better meet their needs. Operating lease rates are generally higher than finance lease rates, in part because of the lessor retained residual value risk.
We describe all of our current leases as “triple-net” operating leases. A triple-net operating lease requires the lessee to make the full lease payment and pay any other expenses associated with the use of the engines, such as maintenance, casualty and liability insurance, sales or use taxes and personal property taxes. The leases contain detailed provisions specifying the lessees’ responsibility for engine damage, maintenance standards and the required condition of the engine upon return at the end of the lease. During the term of the lease, we require the lessee to maintain the engine in accordance with an approved maintenance program designed to meet applicable regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which the lessee operates.
We enter into both long-term and short-term leases which typically provide for monthly payment. Long-term leases typically have original lease terms in excess of one year. Characteristics of a long-term lease also include specified return conditions. Return conditions can be met by the customer through a maintenance overhaul in advance of asset return or a cash settlement at lease end resulting in maintenance revenue to the Company at that time. Maintenance reserves, also referred to as use fees, are often used for payment of maintenance overhauls in advance of asset returns by the lessee to the Company. Where a cash settlement is agreed upon, it may, in some instances, be taken from maintenance reserves paid by the lessee to the Company throughout the course of the lease. Short-term leases typically have an original lease term of less than one year. Short-term leases also include non-refundable, usage-based maintenance fees, which are billed at contractual rates and recognized as revenue over the term of the leases. Payment terms of our leases are predominately monthly in advance for rent and in arrears for the expenses associated with the use of the engines. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, 21% and 31%, respectively, of the Company’s leases by net book value were short-term leases.
We try to mitigate risk where possible. For example, we analyze the credit risk associated with a lessee before entering into any significant lease transaction. Our credit analysis generally consists of evaluating the prospective lessee’s financial standing by utilizing financial statements and trade and/or banking references. In certain circumstances, we may require our lessees to provide additional credit support, such as a letter of credit or a guaranty from a bank or a third party or a security deposit. We manage our interest rate risk through maintaining a balance of fixed and floating rate debt which allows us to limit our exposure to interest rate movements while also allowing us to benefit from low short-term interest rates. The Company utilizes our credit facility as a warehouse facility to aggregate purchased assets. Generally, when the Company aggregates a critical mass of assets through revolver financing, we refinance the assets through the issuance of long-term fixed rate debt through the Asset-Backed Security (“ABS”) and other markets. The maturity profile of the ABS term financings tend to better match the long life characteristics of our long life asset base. Furthermore, the Company also manages interest rate exposure through the purchasing of interest rate swaps which immunizes us from short-term rate movements that would influence the cost of our credit facility borrowings. At December 31, 2022 the Company had $1.1 billion of fixed rate financing. We also evaluate insurance and expropriation risk and evaluate and monitor the political and legal climate of the country in which a particular lessee is located in order to determine our ability to repossess our engines should the need arise. Despite these guidelines, we cannot give assurance that we will not experience collection problems or significant losses in the future. See “Risk Factors” below.
At the commencement of a lease, we may collect, in advance, a security deposit normally equal to at least one month’s lease payment. The security deposit is returned to the lessee after all lease return conditions have been met. As mentioned above, under the terms of some of our leases, during the term of the lease, the lessee pays amounts to us based on usage of the engine, which is referred to as maintenance reserves or use fees, which are designed to cover the expected future maintenance costs. For those leases in which the maintenance reserves are reimbursable to the lessee, maintenance reserves are collected and are reimbursed to the lessee when qualifying maintenance is performed. Under longer-term leases, to the extent that cumulative use fee billings are inadequate to fund expenditures required prior to return of the engine to us, the lessee is obligated to cover the shortfall.
During the lease period, our leases require that maintenance and inspection of the leased engines be performed at qualified maintenance facilities certified by the FAA or its foreign equivalent. In addition, when an engine becomes off-lease, it undergoes inspection to verify compliance with lease return conditions. Our management believes that our attention to our lessees and our emphasis on maintenance and inspection helps preserve residual values and generally helps us to recover our investment in our leased engines.
Upon termination of a lease, we will either enter into a new lease, sell, or part out (disassemble and sell the parts separately), the related engines or airframe. The demand for aftermarket engines for either sale or lease may be affected by a number of variables, including:
•general market conditions;
•regulatory changes (particularly those imposing environmental, maintenance and other requirements on the operation of engines);
•changes in demand for air travel;
•fuel costs;
•changes in the supply and cost of aircraft equipment; and
•technological developments.
The value of a particular used engine or airframe varies greatly depending upon its condition, the maintenance services performed during the lease term and, as applicable, the number of hours or cycles remaining until the next major maintenance interval. If we are unable to lease or sell engines on favorable terms, our financial results and our ability to service debt may be adversely affected. See “Risk Factors” below.
The value of a particular model of engine is heavily dependent on the status of the types of aircraft on which it can be installed. We believe engine values tend to be stable as long as the host aircraft for the engines and the engines themselves are still being manufactured. Prices tend to remain stable and may even rise after a host aircraft is no longer manufactured as long as there is sufficient remaining demand for the host aircraft in the market. However, the value of an engine begins to decline rapidly once the host aircraft is retired from service and/or parted out in significant numbers. Engine values also may decline because of manufacturing defects that surface subsequent to initial manufacture and deployment.
As of December 31, 2022, we had $2,111.9 million of equipment held in our operating lease portfolio, $81.4 million of notes receivable, $17.7 million of maintenance rights, and $6.4 million of investments in sales-type leases, which represented 339 engines, 13 aircraft, one marine vessel and other leased parts and equipment. As of December 31, 2021, we had $1,991.4 million of equipment held in our operating lease portfolio, $115.5 million of notes receivable, and $22.5 million of maintenance rights, which represented 304 engines, 12 aircraft, one marine vessel and other leased parts and equipment.
As of December 31, 2022 minimum future rentals under non-cancelable operating leases of these engines, related equipment and aircraft assets were as follows:

Year | (in thousands)
2023 | $ | 146,842
2024 | 66,513 | 
2025 | 52,000 | 
2026 | 39,410 | 
2027 | 27,763 | 
Thereafter | 35,708 | 
 | $ | 368,236

As of December 31, 2022, we had 80 lessees of commercial aircraft engines and related equipment, aircraft, and other leased parts and equipment in 41 countries. We believe the loss of any one customer would not have a significant long-term adverse effect on our business. We operate in a global market in which our engines are easily transferable among lessees located in many countries, which stabilizes demand and allows us to recover from a loss of a customer. We provide other engine leasing related services such as engine storage, Part 145 maintenance and aircraft tear down services to our customers as well.
In 2011 we entered into an agreement with Mitsui & Co., Ltd. to participate in a joint venture formed as a Dublin-based Irish limited company, Willis Mitsui & Company Engine Support Limited (“WMES”), for the purpose of acquiring and leasing jet engines. Each partner holds a 50% interest in the joint venture. WMES owned a lease portfolio of 35 engines and five aircraft with a net book value of $255.5 million as of December 31, 2022. Our investment in the joint venture was $41.0 million as of December 31, 2022.
In 2014 we entered into an agreement with China Aviation Supplies Import & Export Corporation (“CASC”) to participate in a joint venture named CASC Willis Lease Finance Company Limited (“CASC Willis”), a joint venture based in Shanghai, China. Each partner holds a 50% interest in the joint venture. CASC Willis acquires and leases jet engines to Chinese airlines and concentrates on meeting the fast-growing demand for leased commercial aircraft engines and aviation assets in the People’s Republic of China. CASC Willis owned a lease portfolio of four engines with a net book value of $42.7 million as of December 31, 2022. Our investment in the joint venture was $15.2 million as of December 31, 2022. 
AIRCRAFT LEASING
As of December 31, 2022, our operating lease portfolio included five A319-100 aircraft, four ATR 72-500 aircraft, one A320-200 aircraft, one A320-233 aircraft, one A321-200 aircraft, and one Boeing 737-700 with an aggregate net book value of $134.5 million.
Our aircraft leases are “triple-net” leases and the lessee is responsible for making the full lease payment and paying any other expenses associated with the use of the aircraft, such as maintenance, casualty and liability insurance, sales or use taxes and personal property taxes. In addition, the lessee is responsible for normal maintenance and repairs, engine and airframe overhauls, and compliance with return conditions of flight equipment on lease. Under the provisions of many leases, for certain engine and airframe overhauls, we reimburse the lessee for costs incurred up to but not exceeding maintenance reserves the lessee has paid to us. Maintenance reserves are designed to cover the expected maintenance costs. The lessee is also responsible for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to the aircraft. We require our lessees to comply with FAA requirements. We periodically inspect our leased aircraft. Generally, we require a deposit as security for the lessee’s performance of obligations under the lease and the condition of the aircraft upon return. In addition, the leases contain extensive provisions regarding our remedies and rights in the event of a default by the lessee and specific provisions regarding the condition of the aircraft upon return. The lessee is required to continue to make lease payments under all circumstances, including periods during which the aircraft is not in operation due to maintenance or grounding. 
SPARE PARTS SALES
The sale of spare parts is managed by the Company’s wholly-owned and vertically-integrated subsidiary, Willis Aero. Willis Aero primarily engages in the sale of aircraft engine parts and materials that it acquires via acquisition or consignment from third parties or from the leasing portfolio. This business segment enables our Company to provide end-of-life solutions for the growing supply of surplus aircraft and engines, as well as manage the full lifecycle of our lease assets, enhance the returns on our engine portfolio and create incremental value for our shareholders.  As of December 31, 2022, spare parts inventory had a carrying value of $38.6 million.
ASSET MANAGEMENT
Willis Asset Management is a wholly-owned and vertically-integrated subsidiary whose primary focus is the engine management and consulting business. Willis Asset Management had 289 engines, excluding WLFC engines, under management as of December 31, 2022. 
COMPETITION
The markets for our products and services are very competitive, and we face competition from a number of sources. These competitors include aircraft engine and aircraft parts manufacturers, aircraft and aircraft engine lessors, airline and aircraft service and repair companies and aircraft and aircraft engine spare parts distributors. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than us. Those resources may include greater name recognition, larger product lines, complementary lines of business, greater financial, marketing, information systems and other resources. In addition, equipment manufacturers, aircraft maintenance providers, FAA certified repair facilities and other aviation aftermarket suppliers may vertically integrate into the markets that we serve, thereby significantly increasing industry competition and negatively impacting the Company. We can give no assurance that competitive pressures will not materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We compete primarily with aircraft engine manufacturers as well as with other aircraft engine lessors. It is common for commercial aircraft operators and MROs to utilize several leasing companies to meet their aircraft engine needs and to minimize reliance on a single leasing company.
Our competitors compete with us in many ways, including pricing, technical expertise, lease flexibility, engine availability, supply reliability, customer service and the quality and condition of engines. Many of our competitors have greater financial resources than we have, or are affiliates of larger companies. We emphasize the quality of our portfolio of aircraft engines, supply reliability and high level of customer service to our aircraft equipment lessees. We focus on ensuring adequate aircraft engine availability in high-demand locations, dedicate large portions of our organization to building relationships with lessees, maintain close day-to-day coordination with lessees and have developed an engine pooling arrangement that allows pool members quick access to available spare aircraft engines.
INSURANCE
In addition to requiring full indemnification under the terms of our leases, we require our lessees to carry the types of insurance customary in the air transportation industry, including comprehensive third-party liability insurance and physical damage and casualty insurance. We require that we be named as an additional insured on liability insurance policies with the Company and our lenders normally identified as the loss payee on policies carried by lessees for damage to the leased equipment. We monitor compliance with the insurance provisions of the leases. We also carry contingent physical damage and third-party liability insurance as well as product liability insurance at levels determined to be appropriate by the Company.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
Our customers are subject to a high degree of regulation in the jurisdictions in which they operate. For example, the FAA regulates the manufacture, repair and operation of all aircraft operated in the U.S. and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries, such as the European Aviation Safety Agency (“EASA”) in Europe, regulate aircraft operated in those countries. Such regulations also indirectly affect our business operations. All aircraft operated in the U.S. must be maintained under a continuous condition-monitoring program and must periodically undergo thorough inspection and maintenance. The inspection, maintenance and repair procedures for commercial aircraft are prescribed by regulatory authorities and can be performed only by certified repair facilities utilizing certified technicians. The FAA can suspend or revoke the authority of air carriers or their licensed personnel for failure to comply with regulations and ground aircraft if their airworthiness is in question.
While our leasing and reselling business is not regulated, the aircraft, engines and related parts that we purchase, lease and sell must be accompanied by documentation that enables the customer to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. Furthermore, before parts may be installed in an aircraft, they must meet certain standards of condition established by the FAA and/or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied by compliance with FAA requirements. With respect to a particular engine or engine component, we utilize FAA and/or EASA certified repair stations to repair and certify engines and components to ensure marketability.
Governmental regulations where the related airframe is registered, and where the aircraft is operated, stipulate noise and emissions levels restrictions. For example, jurisdictions throughout the world have adopted noise regulations which require all aircraft to comply with Stage III noise requirements. In addition to the current Stage III compliance requirements, the U.S. and the International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”) have adopted a more stringent set of “Stage IV” standards for noise levels which apply to engines manufactured or certified from 2006 onward. At this time, the U.S. regulations do not require any phase-out of aircraft that qualify only for Stage III compliance, but the European Union (“EU”) has established a framework for the imposition of operating limitations on non-Stage IV aircraft.
As of December 31, 2022, most of the engines in our lease portfolio are Stage IV engines and are generally suitable for use on one or more commonly used aircraft. 
We believe that the aviation industry will be subject to continued regulatory activity. Additionally, increased oversight will continue to originate from the quality assurance departments of airline operators. We have been able to meet all such requirements to date, and are well positioned to meet any additional requirements that may be imposed. We cannot give assurance, however, that new, more stringent government regulations will not be adopted in the future or that any such new regulations, if enacted, would not have a material adverse impact on us.
FINANCING/SOURCE OF FUNDS
We, directly or through our Willis Engine Structured Trust III, IV, V and VI (“WEST III,” “WEST IV,” “WEST V,” and “WEST VI”) asset-backed securitizations typically acquire engines with a combination of equity capital and funds borrowed from financial institutions. In order to facilitate financing and leasing of engines, most of our engines are generally owned through a statutory or common law trust that is wholly-owned by us or our subsidiaries. We usually borrow up to 85% of an engine purchase price. Substantially all of our assets secure our related indebtedness. We typically acquire engines from airlines, engine manufacturers or from other lessors. From time to time, we selectively acquire engines prior to a firm commitment to lease or sell the engine, depending on the price of the engine and market demand with the expectation that we can lease or sell such engines in the future. Additionally, for discrete financing purposes, we will enter into bi-lateral and preferred financing arrangements from time to time.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2022, we had 288 total employees, of which 263 are full-time employees (excluding consultants), in sales and marketing, technical service and administration. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we believe our employee relations are satisfactory.
