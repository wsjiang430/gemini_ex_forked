 Mission
 Our mission is to make biology easier to engineer. That has never changed. Every choice we’ve made with respect to our business model, our platform, our people and our culture is grounded in whether it will advance our mission. Biology inherently offers incredible capabilities that we can only imagine in human-made technologies—self-assembly, self-repair, self-replication—capabilities that can enable more renewable and innovative approaches for nearly every industry. To realize this potential, we are building a platform for cell programming by bringing together unparalleled scale, software, automation, data science and reusable biological knowledge, enabling responsible solutions for the next generation of foods, pharmaceuticals, materials and more.
Overview
Ginkgo is the leading platform for cell programming, providing flexible, end-to-end services that solve challenges for organizations across diverse markets, from food and agriculture to pharmaceuticals to industrial and specialty chemicals. Ginkgo’s biosecurity and public health unit, Concentric by Ginkgo, is building global infrastructure for biosecurity to empower governments, communities, and public health leaders to prevent, detect and respond to a wide variety of biological threats.
 Our founders are engineers from diverse fields who, more than 20 years ago, were inspired by an astonishing feature of biology: it runs on digital code. It’s just A, T, C, and G rather than 0 and 1. But where computer bits are used to communicate information, genetic code is inherently physical and as it is read, physical structures are made. We program computers to manipulate bits, but we program cells to manipulate atoms. Cells are the building blocks of our food, our environment and even ourselves.
We use our platform to program cells on behalf of our customers. These “cell programs” are designed to enable biological production of products as diverse as novel therapeutics, key food ingredients, and chemicals currently derived from petroleum. Biology did not evolve by end market. All of these applications run on cells which have a common code—DNA—and a common programming platform can enable all of them. Because of this shared platform, we are able to drive scale and learning efficiencies while maintaining flexibility and diversity in our program areas. Ultimately, customers come to us because they believe we maximize the probability of successfully developing their products.
Customers may work with Ginkgo to discover new molecules or biological systems, to accelerate the development of a system, or to overhaul their manufacturing processes. They might, for example, be looking to produce a particular chemical via fermentation, at a lower cost, with enhanced supply chain reliability or sustainability. Or perhaps the customer needs a microbe that will live and grow on the roots of corn and convert nitrogen in the air into usable fertilizer for a plant, resulting in improved plant growth. Or a customer might need a viral capsid engineered to target certain tissue types and deliver a gene therapy where it’s needed while not causing a problematic immune response. All of these programs and more run on a common platform at Ginkgo.
We care deeply how our platform is used and recognize biosecurity as a necessary complement to our cell programming work. Biology has the potential to transform health, agriculture, energy, materials, and beyond—but we also know that advances in biotechnology, alongside an increasingly interconnected biological world, contribute to enhanced biological risk. The first, critical step in addressing this risk is to build a robust early warning system to act as a radar for biological threats. This is the focus of our biosecurity and public health unit, Concentric by Ginkgo. Through this initiative, we are building a biosecurity "operating system" that manages the underlying capabilities, networks, and data infrastructure needed for a flexible combination of biomonitoring solutions.
The foundation of our cell programming platform includes two core assets that execute a wide variety of cell programs for customers according to their specifications: our Foundry and our Codebase.
 ●Our Foundry wraps proprietary software and automation around core cell engineering workflows—designing DNA, writing DNA, inserting that DNA into cells, testing cells to measure performance—and leverages data analytics and data science to inform each iteration of design. The software, automation and data analysis pipelines we leverage in 


the Foundry drive a strong scale economic that we refer to as “Knight's Law.” We expect Foundry output, which we currently measure by daily strain tests, to increase year over year, while the cost per strain test decreases. We expect to be able to pass these savings along to our customers, allowing them to take more “shots on goal” with their programs.
 ●Our Codebase includes both our physical (engineered cells and genetic parts) and digital (genetic sequences and performance data) biological assets. Codebase accumulates as we execute more cell programs on the platform. Every program, whether successful or not, generates valuable Codebase and helps inform future experimental designs and provides reusable genetic parts, making our cell program designs more efficient. Historically, we have augmented our Codebase via acquisition of assets such as microbial strains, sample collections, and sequence data. In 2022, our Codebase grew to over two billion proprietary protein sequences as a result of recent acquisitions.
 



Figure 1: Our platform is used to design, write, and debug DNA code in engineered organisms to execute programs for our customers. Our Foundry leverages proprietary software, automation, and data analytics to reduce the cost of cell programming. Our Codebase consists of reusable biological assets that help accelerate the engineering process.
As the platform scales, we have observed a virtuous cycle between our Foundry, our Codebase, and the value we deliver to customers. Sketched below, we believe this virtuous cycle sustains Ginkgo’s growth and differentiated value proposition.
●Foundry: As we take on more work in the Foundry, we benefit from scale economics, which over time may lead to lower program costs. We expect that these lower costs, in turn, will drive additional demand for our cell programming capabilities. 
 ●Codebase: Cell programs also generate Codebase, which can drive better experimental direction and improve the odds of technical success, further increasing our customer value proposition, which we believe will result in additional demand.
 
Put simply: we believe that as we scale, the platform improves. We believe that this in turn yields better program execution and customer outcomes, ultimately driving more demand, which drives further investments in scale and platform improvements, and so on. We believe this positive feedback loop has the potential to drive compounding value creation in the future, as every new program we add contributes to both near-term revenues and has the potential to add significant downstream economics and more positive impact.
 



Figure 2: Ginkgo’s virtuous cycle: as we scale, we see greater efficiency and higher odds of technical success, which helps drive further scaling as our value proposition improves.
Our cell programming business model mirrors the structure of our platform and we are compensated in two primary ways. First, we charge usage fees for services, in much the same way that cloud computing companies charge usage fees for utilization of computing capacity or contract research organizations (“CROs”) charge for services. The total addressable market for biological R&D services, including labor and tools, is in the tens of billions of dollars—performed mainly by companies in-house—and Ginkgo has a significant penetration opportunity. Additionally, we negotiate a value share with our customers (typically in the form of royalties, milestones, and/or equity interests) in order to align our economics with the success of the programs enabled by our platform. As we add new programs, our portfolio of programs with this “downstream” value potential grows.
 We believe that cell programming has the potential to be as ubiquitous in the physical world as computer programming has become in the digital world and that products in the future will be grown rather than made. To enable that vision, we are building a horizontal platform to make biology easier to engineer. Our business model is aligned with this strategy and with the success of our customers, setting us on what we believe is a path towards sustainable innovation for years to come.
An Introduction to Synthetic Biology
To fully tell the story of cell programming, we have to start four billion years ago. All living things evolved from a single cell, a tiny bubble containing the code that enabled it to assemble and reproduce itself. But, importantly, that process of reproduction wasn’t perfect; each copy introduced new mutations in the code. These changes are responsible for one of the most powerful and defining features of biology: evolution. Over eons, that first cell and all its progeny copied themselves, and their DNA evolved to create new functions: to eat new kinds of foods and to produce new kinds of chemicals, structures, and behaviors. As reproduction became more, well, interactive, organisms developed tools to borrow DNA from each other, accelerating the pace of evolution. These functions, and thus the genetic code programming the functions, stuck around when they helped the organisms survive and create more descendants. This went on and on for four billion years, leaving us the wild codebase of DNA that enables the diversity of life forms we see on the planet today.
Synthetic biology’s story begins mere decades ago, as biologists began to decode the molecular secrets of DNA. The billions-year-old tools of cells—enzymes that cut, copy, and paste sequences of DNA code—are now being leveraged by humans to read, write, and edit DNA in the lab. Polymerases that copy DNA are used to enable polymerase chain reaction (“PCR”) tests

for COVID-19 and the CRISPR/Cas system from bacteria now enables editing of human genomes to potentially cure genetic diseases.
Today we are using these tools to learn from the full breadth of evolution and biodiversity to write new biological code. Simple soil bacteria produce everything from vital antibiotics to the smell of fresh rain. We can reuse elements of these DNA programs to make new products. Biochemistry is extraordinarily versatile; we’ve reused the same genetic code libraries across applications as diverse as fine fragrances, baking, and consumer electronics. We may be able to develop programs that can digest human-made “forever chemicals” that biology never encountered before.
As cell programmers, we operate with humility and respect for biology. Our tools are simply borrowed, and the history of biotechnology is a mere blink of an eye compared to the history of living things. Today, we write rudimentary code. We believe that someday our children will write poetry in DNA.
Programming life



Figure 3: DNA strands are sequences composed of four chemical bases, or nucleotides, represented by the letters A, T, C and G.
Like computers, cells run on digital code. DNA strands are sequences composed of four chemical bases, or nucleotides, represented by the letters A, T, C and G. The letters along the strand encode the proteins that make up the cell and perform biochemical functions. The translation of DNA to RNA to protein is known as the “central dogma” of molecular biology.



Figure 4: The translation of DNA to RNA to Protein is known as the “central dogma” of molecular biology.

DNA is transcribed to RNA, which is translated to proteins, which in turn perform myriad functions inside or outside of the cell, as structural supports, antibodies, and enzymes that catalyze reactions of all the chemistry performed by the cell. Synthetic biology, through the programming of DNA, enables the development of products made from all of these biological molecules, including DNA based gene therapies, mRNA vaccines, proteins and enzymes used as therapeutics, food ingredients or processing aids, or organic molecules that can be made by building pathways of enzymes inside a cell, antibiotics and other medicines, vitamins, fragrances, and even the building blocks of polymers that are today produced via petroleum. Programmed cells themselves are also products of synthetic biology, as probiotics for nutrition and wellness, microbiome therapeutics or cell therapies, agricultural biologicals, or industrial tools for remediation.
 Once a cell is programmed to produce a new molecule, it can produce the molecule and also replicate itself, creating an exponentially growing number of product-producing cells. Many products of genetic engineering are manufactured in facilities that look like breweries, taking advantage of the centuries old process of industrial fermentation to grow cells at high density, and transforming simple sugars into valuable products that can be extracted and commercialized.

Cell programming services
 Ginkgo’s platform is a generalized, horizontal platform that provides end-to-end cell programming services to our customers, enabling them to develop the wide array of biological products listed above (and beyond). From the discovery of novel biological functions through the optimization of production strains, processes, and downstream purification of biological products, Ginkgo’s platform is a full spectrum synthetic biology R&D services provider. We provide more details about our platform and our customers' applications in the sections that follow.



Figure 5: An overview of a simple cell program.
The Impact of Cell Programming & Biosecurity
 The power of biology has never been more apparent. When synthetic biology was featured on the cover of The Economist in April of 2019, a much smaller segment of the world considered its implications. Today, the global lexicon has shifted. The

COVID-19 pandemic awakened billions of people to the need for biosecurity infrastructure and showed them the value biological products provide to their lives. The impact biology can have on society and industries is clearer than ever.
Further, in September 2022, Jake Sullivan—President Biden’s national security adviser—announced that the U.S. government expects biotechnology to have “outsized importance over the coming decade” in the context of geopolitical competition, because of the ability to “read, write, and edit genetic code, which has rendered biology programmable.” To this end, President Biden issued an Executive Order on Advancing Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing for a Sustainable, Safe and Secure American Bioeconomy and the U.S. government launched a new National Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Initiative. Both are meant to unlock synthetic biology innovations for health, climate change, energy, food security, agriculture, supply chain resilience, and national and economic security. The Administration also released a National Biodefense Strategy and Implementation Plan, underscoring that advances in biotechnology must be accompanied by robust capabilities to counter biological threats, whether naturally-occurring, accidental, or deliberate.
 We no longer question if biotechnology will transform a given industry, we simply question whether we are creative enough to imagine how, and whether we are ready to utilize biology responsibly.


ESG is in our DNA
Biology affects all of us, and we believe cell programming will change the world. Our customers are developing products with far reaching implications for health and the environment. This potential for extraordinary impact, which reaches to the core of who we are and everything about our natural world, requires extraordinary care in how the tools of cell programming are built and used. Technologies reflect the values of the organizations that build them, so our commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) priorities and care must underscore everything we do.
We also must recognize that biotechnologies have not always reflected the values necessary for sustainable and equitable impact and, as a result, remain controversial. Indeed, companies that produce GMOs for human consumption are restricted from certain ESG indices, placing genetic engineering as a major ESG risk alongside the production of weapons, tobacco products, and fossil fuels. We hope to chart a new course built on care so that the world can benefit from the power of biological engineering while avoiding potential risks.
In July 2022, we released our inaugural sustainability report, Caring at Ginkgo. Our inaugural report was guided by key ESG frameworks and standards (e.g., the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) and Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics) as well as a third-party led materiality assessment (as defined by GRI).
 Environmental
We face an urgent environmental crisis that is forcing us to reconsider how we make everything, from our homes, to our food, to our clothing. For centuries, we’ve treated nature as an infinite resource and infinite trash can, extracting raw materials, shaping them through industrial processes that spew out greenhouse gases, and then throwing them away. But these resources are not infinite and there is no “away.” The results have been disastrous—climate change, loss of biodiversity, and pollution have impacted every corner of our world and continue to threaten our way of life.
Cell programming and biological manufacturing are working to address some of the issues that are most contributing to climate change today, from fossil fuel dependency to agricultural emissions, and land use to plastic pollution. Ultimately, biology offers a fundamental shift in how things are made and disposed of: a world where things grow and decay, creating circular, regenerative processes.
There is significant concern that genetic engineering itself creates a form of genetic “pollution” in the environment, with genes from one context introduced into another. This is a concern we take seriously and consider deeply throughout the lifecycle of our programs to ensure that genes introduced will not cause damage—for example, by spreading antibiotic resistance or toxins. We care because the environmental release of certain genetically engineered microbes can also offer tremendous environmental benefit. For example:
●Crop-associated microbes programmed with the nitrogen fixing properties of common soil bacteria may be able to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers, which have been estimated to contribute 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions and account for 4% of natural gas consumption. This is a key priority for Bayer Crop Science (“Bayer”), which is working with us in this space. 
 ●Microbes programmed to clean up wastewater or contaminated land is the work of Allonnia, LLC (“Allonnia”), a company we formed in partnership with Battelle.
 

And we are just getting started we believe biology is our best tool to reverse the damage to our planet and chart us on a path towards sustainability in the future.
Social
Technology isn’t neutral. Our values and biases are embedded in the technologies we make, in the applications we consider, and in the ways we address problems. Inclusion of those who have historically been left out of the development of new technologies is essential to building equitable and positive outcomes. Just as biological ecosystems thrive with more diversity, the inclusion of many different voices is essential to growing our company and to ensuring that the viewpoints of historically marginalized people are included in the development of our platform. We have many active efforts in recruiting and retaining diverse talent and will continue to invest in this work (see “—Our People & Culture”).

Marginalized people who have been left out of the development of technologies are also the groups most likely to bear the greatest harm, whether from climate change, pollution, or health disparities. The COVID-19 pandemic has made this inequality starkly clear—in the United States, it has been communities of color that have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic and have had the least access to testing, treatment, and vaccination.
These values and initiatives are not just a top-down corporate policy, they are an intrinsic part of our culture. Grassroots fundraising challenges to support local and international aid organizations are a regular feature of our internal messaging channels.
Governance
Our culture is built on care, transparency, diversity, employee ownership and engagement, and a deep, humble respect for biology. Transparency is essential to how we operate, to enable sharing of the insights and tools that enable our platform to grow, as well as to build trust and accountability with all of our stakeholders. We have advocated for more transparency in our industry, including supporting GMO labeling, and seek to educate policymakers and the general public about the benefits and risks of synthetic biology through our advocacy efforts.
The individuals who work at Ginkgo and build our platform care deeply about how that platform is used and the impact our company will have in the world. We believe a workforce with strong equity ownership will make the wise decisions needed to build long-term value for our company, and a company whose long-term impacts make them proud. That is why we have implemented a multi-class stock structure that permits all employees (current and future), not just founders, to hold high-vote (10 votes per share) common stock. We believe that our multi-class stock structure will help maintain the long-term mentality we have benefited from as a founder-led company.
For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Ginkgo’s Business—Risks Related to Our Common Stock, Organizational Structure and Governance—Only our employees and directors are entitled to hold shares of Class B common stock (including shares of Class B common stock granted or otherwise issued to our employees and directors in the future), which shares have ten votes per share. This limits or precludes other stockholders’ ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, the approval of certain employee compensation plans, the adoption of certain amendments to our organizational documents and the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval.”
We have selected directors with decades of experience serving as leaders in the life sciences and technology industries. Ginkgo’s board of directors and management team will leverage that experience and consider the interests of stockholders, customers, employees, suppliers, academic researchers, governments, communities, and other stakeholders to pursue long-term value for our company and drive the sustained health of our global community. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Ginkgo’s Business—Risks Related to Our Common Stock, Organizational Structure and Governance—Our focus on the long-term best interests of our company and our consideration of all of our stakeholders, including our stockholders, workforce, customers, suppliers, academic researchers, governments, communities and other stakeholders that we may identify from time to time, may conflict with short-term or medium-term financial interests and business performance, which may adversely impact the value of our common stock.”
Cell programming is expected to transform all industries
Biology grows. Biology adapts and evolves. Biology heals itself and regenerates. Biology is also, remarkably, programmable, offering us the tools to work with biology to transform how we make stuff. With cell programming, we help our customers

across industries grow better products. What does “better” mean? Better products might be more sustainable, have more stable and resilient supply chains, be more accessible, have higher quality and more consistency, and come with lower economic and environmental costs of manufacturing. They can also be truly transformative, fundamentally changing the field of possibilities for what products can do. We have supported many companies that are leveraging our cell programming platform to address some of the world’s most challenging environmental and social issues.
Pharma & Biotech
Biopharma has been a nexus of tremendous innovation in cell programming and synthetic biology. The COVID-19 pandemic brought emerging novel technologies, such as mRNA vaccines, to the mainstream. These vaccines contain genetic code that our bodies read to produce viral proteins and stimulate an immune response and antibody production. New nucleic acid vaccines can be programmed quickly, such as the booster vaccines being developed against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, offering the potential for rapid response to other future pathogens. They can also be programmed to target a number of other diseases. In the wake of the success of nucleic acid vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic, new programs for HIV and cancer vaccines, among others, are accelerating.
 Biologic medicines like insulin and other protein drugs and antibodies are also produced via cell programming, making a difference in the treatment of countless diseases. Over 40% of the therapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in 2022 were biologics. In addition, new modalities enabled by cell programming, such as cell and gene therapies, microbiome therapies, and regenerative medicines, are beginning to come online. We believe human health and the ways we treat disease will be transformed by improvements in cell programming technology.
Ginkgo has been active in this field in recent years and we expect to significantly expand our support of therapeutic applications over coming years. From supporting companies like Biogen, Inc. (“Biogen”) to develop gene therapies to creating biocatalysts for the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (“APIs”) with Merck & Co. (“Merck”) to building novel expression hosts for biologic medicines with Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk”), we are using our platform to deliver transformational innovations across a range of disease areas.
Industrials & Environment
Since the industrial revolution, manufacturing techniques have been extractive, wasteful, and unsustainable. Not only must we innovate new manufacturing methods in order to keep up with growing demand, we must also work to remediate issues we have caused historically, by cleaning up our environment and addressing climate change.
Ginkgo is not only working with customers to create cell programs that enable cost-efficient, renewable, and sustainable production of chemicals and materials, such as our work with Genomatica, Inc. (“Genomatica”), but we have also participated in the formation of Allonnia, a company focused on environmental remediation. Plastic waste and many of the pollutants that plague industrial manufacturing and extraction sites are novel in the course of evolutionary history, so biology has not yet evolved to degrade them efficiently. Cell programming can enable the discovery and development of new enzymes capable of degrading recalcitrant pollutants and recycling waste while entirely reimagining manufacturing for the future.
Food & Agriculture
Food is inherently biological: it comes from life and sustains life. Cell programming can be leveraged to improve the availability of essential food and nutrition to a growing population, decrease the environmental impact and cost of food production, and provide consumers with increased choice.
We are working with some of the largest multinational agriculture companies, including Bayer and Corteva, to develop cell programs that would make crop production more efficient and sustainable, reducing synthetic nitrogen fertilizer and pesticide usage. In food, we have been active in flavors and sweeteners with leading global companies such as Robertet, Inc. (“Robertet”) and Givaudan S.A. (“Givaudan”), and helped Motif FoodWorks, Inc. (“Motif”) produce animal proteins without the need for industrial farming of animals, resulting in the launch of its first product, HEMAMI, in 2021.
Consumer & Technology
Most physical goods have biological origins—from the petrochemicals in our fabrics to fine chemicals extracted from plants—but industry does not necessarily leverage biology, or leverage biology efficiently, to produce these items. Petrochemicals, for example, are used in everything from our fabrics to our cosmetics to our paints. These chemicals and

polymers are generally created in complex chemical and physical reactions from crude oil, but crude oil is just the result of millions of years of decomposition of previously living matter (they are fossil fuels after all). These biological building blocks can instead be programmed in a living organism to produce these items sustainably, without extracting natural resources. Even in areas where industry does leverage biology, such as extracting raw materials or fine chemicals from plants, we believe the current approaches are woefully inefficient or rife with social consequences.
We have supported Cronos in their effort to biosynthesize multiple cannabinoid molecules, with the goal of reducing cost, improving purity and predictability, and enabling production of rare molecules. In 2022, we partnered with Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd. (“Sumitomo”) to help produce ingredients for beauty and personal care through fermentation. We also helped launch a new company in 2021, Arcaea LLC ("Arcaea"), which is focusing on leveraging biology, from proteins to the microbiome, to build a suite of innovative and efficacious personal care products.
Market Opportunity
For several decades in the computing industry, software ran entirely in local environments: companies built and ran their own servers and customized their applications. The dominance of software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) and cloud computing over the past decade has demonstrated the value in having common architectures and enabling horizontal platforms. What users may have sacrificed in customizability, they more than gained in innovation, efficiency, and scalability. We believe Ginkgo is ushering in a similar transition in cell programming, a programming discipline with the power to shape living things and grow applications across the physical world.
The value of these applications will be significant
Given the breadth of application areas and the potential of biology (see “—The Impact of Cell Programming”), we believe that the end markets for bioengineered products will be enormous. But these applications reflect only what we can already imagine. As we develop a greater ability to program biology and direct it towards novel and more challenging applications, the spectrum of possibilities will undoubtedly grow. Computers were used for little more than counting for decades; we firmly believe the most valuable applications of cell programming are not yet apparent.

Large existing market for “on prem” cell programming research and development
Cell programming today is done in a highly inefficient, distributed manner reminiscent of the early days of computing. Essentially every organization looking to innovate in biology builds its own biology labs in the same way that individual tech companies used to set up their own servers instead of using cloud computing. Scientists spend hours moving liquids around rather than designing novel experiments just as computer programmers once spent most of their time physically writing and debugging code (by punching cards, for example) rather than designing new applications.
Because of the way cell programming is done today, intellectual property that could be useful for multiple applications is tied up by exclusivities that delay the progress of the field overall. Ginkgo’s platform breaks down these silos and democratizes access to the most advanced technologies in the field, enabling customers of all sizes to more efficiently drive innovation.
While R&D budgets may rise and fall based on the macroeconomic climate, the market is estimated to be in the tens of billions of dollars. This work is being done in a distributed manner, sacrificing benefits from scale and learning economies. The spend comprises both labor—scientists designing and executing experiments—and “tools”—things like DNA synthesis, reagents, and equipment. Ginkgo brings efficiencies to both elements of this existing market.
●Labor: When scientists leverage advanced automation, they can both reduce error rates and free time otherwise spent performing manual work (e.g., pipetting liquids from one plate to another). Freed from the burden of manual programming, scientists have more time to practice the art of cell programming: designing the direction of experimentation, mining data for new insights or exploring new techniques or application areas. This in turn increases the demand for programs as scientists retain a greater capacity for innovation and generate more ideas to test. 
 ●Tools: Ginkgo’s scale provides a cost advantage in two primary ways. First, we reduce the amount of capital investment required by our customers—an early stage company building on our platform may never need to build a molecular biology lab. Second, our proprietary technologies and scale economics drive down the marginal cost of each experiment. Combined, these factors have the impact of transforming what is typically a large fixed cost investment for a cell programmer into a much lower variable cost. This is akin to an IT department not having to build and maintain a costly bank of servers and instead paying a marginal usage-based fee to their cloud computing vendor. Additionally, and perhaps even more impactful, our Codebase provides host cells, genetic parts and 


associated data for our customers that are unavailable elsewhere and which may reduce the total amount of work required.
 
As the cost of computing power declined exponentially in computer programming, the demand for computing power increased exponentially as developers dreamed up more and more sophisticated applications. We expect the same to be true in cell programming: as our platform scales in capability and capacity, we hope that the range of applications accessible to cell programming will likewise expand in breadth and sophistication.
Given the current and potential future size of the market for this work, Ginkgo’s ability to penetrate the market and convert customers from “on prem” R&D to outsourced services is a key driver. In the current macroeconomic climate, where potential customers’ R&D budgets may be cut, Ginkgo may be somewhat insulated because our growth has much more to do with the willingness of customers to outsource R&D than the growth rate of the industry overall. In fact, we believe that challenging economic climates may actually encourage potential customers to re-evaluate the way they perform R&D, potentially favoring variable cost service providers like us over “on prem” facilities and employee populations that are harder to ramp up and down quickly.
 Industry Overview
We believe that Ginkgo is changing the structure of the biotechnology industry. In much the same way that cloud computing centralized hosting services and ushered in a wave of SaaS companies, Ginkgo is scaling the capabilities needed to program cells. By making these tools more accessible, we hope to usher in a wave of innovation in both “hardware” (life science tools) and “software” (cell programs).
At Ginkgo, we have always admired the symbiotic and regenerative nature of biology, which sits in stark contrast to the often extractive nature of existing technologies. We are often asked who we think the “winners” and “losers” in the industry will be as Ginkgo scales, as if it is a given that our growth must come at the expense of others in the ecosystem. We reject that notion. As our platform scales, we seek to drive benefits for all existing players in this ecosystem:
●Innovators—whether in academic labs, startups, or global conglomerates—benefit from faster and more successful R&D efforts 
 ●Scientists are freed to unleash their creativity (we understand the pain of spending years pipetting at the bench too!) 
 ●Life science tools and manufacturing companies benefit from having a clear technical roadmap and known demand to justify investments 
 ●Society benefits from responsible innovation, driving more sustainable, cost effective, and high-performance products
 
Program Layer: Ginkgo enables and accelerates product companies, which historically have had to vertically integrate
Ginkgo is not a product company; we are an enabling platform for product companies in a range of end markets. We do not seek to “pick winners” and focus instead on building our platform rather than investing in product-specific risk. Platforms require scale and a relentless focus on innovation while taking a product to market requires many specialized functions that vary depending on the product:
●A novel food ingredient requires food scientists to test and enhance taste and functionality 
 ●A therapeutic requires clinicians to conduct animal and human studies to test safety and efficacy
 ●A novel material requires materials scientists to evaluate elasticity, durability, conductivity, or other required features 
 ●An agricultural product requires field trials
     Once the product is developed, major investments are also needed to manufacture, distribute, and market the product. These are the jobs of our customers, the product companies.
Historically, product companies have had to invest in their own R&D capabilities, building their own labs and hiring their own scientists. This investment is inefficient due to lack of scale and drains resources away from application testing and product development. Ginkgo’s platform is not application-specific. The same engineering tools can be used for programs in completely different application areas: cells all run on the same genetic code. As product companies develop their products on Ginkgo’s platform, they gain efficiencies and increase their probability of success. New companies that build on our

platform never need to make the fixed capital investments to start a lab from scratch; they are able to leapfrog and compete effectively against established companies.
Technology Layer: Ginkgo collaborates with life science tools companies to drive technology advancements
Because we’re constantly thinking about how to enable the next several years of scaling of our platform, we have good insights into future bottlenecks and welcome the opportunity to collaborate to build and invest in technologies that will break through those barriers. We are the largest customer for many of our strategic suppliers and, as such, play an important role in advancing new technologies. As a result, we are often able to secure preferred access, often including custom development and leading economic terms, to next-generation technologies and pass those benefits along to customers.
We expect to continue to invest in and support the development of emerging technologies in this space. In certain areas where Ginkgo has unique needs, we may acquire technologies directly, as we did with Gen9, Inc.’s ("Gen9") DNA assembly platform, which was particularly valuable for more complex DNA synthesis needs. In many other areas, we will support new and existing technology companies by placing anchor orders and partnering to develop technology roadmaps that break new ground. In 2022, we made several acquisitions that brought technologies that can be broadly deployed across our programs, including Zymergen Inc. ("Zymergen"), FGen AG ("FGen"), and Altar SAS ("Altar"). We also acquired specialized assets that opened up new market opportunities for us such as Bayer’s West Sacramento Agricultural Biologicals team and facility, and Circularis Biotechnologies, Inc. ("Circularis"), an emerging circular RNA company.
 By acting as a horizontal platform, Ginkgo can focus on what we do best (cell programming), our customers can focus on what they do best (bringing products to market in their industry), and our suppliers can focus on what they do best (building great hardware and tools). Biology did not evolve by industry and so cell programming is able to benefit from the scale and efficiency of a horizontal platform. Vertical integration is no longer required, allowing each layer of the ecosystem to flourish as we collectively enable more rapid growth across the industry.
Enabling Customer Success
Ginkgo serves diverse customers across a variety of end markets. Some of these customers may have in-house biological R&D teams and others may have never thought biotechnology applied to their business. In either case, they come to us with a challenge—whether it is supply chain volatility, a race to develop an innovative new product, or an existential threat facing an industry on the wrong side of history—and we partner to enable a biological solution. We begin our relationship by working collaboratively to design the set of specifications for the end product(s) our customer desires. Our cell programmers then take that set of specifications and design an engineering plan to create a cell program that meets or exceeds that set of specifications. When we finish, our customers receive the final engineered organism (which either produces or is their product of interest) and a full “tech transfer” package for manufacturing and downstream processing (which they can implement themselves or pass to a contract manufacturer with our support). Our customers then take these organisms and/or purified products through the final stages of product development (e.g., formulations, clinical trials, field trials, etc.).
Our commercial team is organized to both establish new relationships with potential customers (traditional business development) as well as maintain and expand relationships with our existing customers (which we call “alliance management”; this team often works jointly with our business development team on sales efforts).

Our business development team has both expertise in relevant industries (Consumer & Technology, Industrial & Environment, Agriculture, Food & Nutrition, Pharma & Biotech, and Government & Defense) as well as expertise in our Foundry capabilities and synthetic biology. With this background we are able to identify industry or consumer challenges where biology can serve as a solution. Our categories of customers, independent of industry, include potential customers who have R&D teams with some synthetic biology capabilities where choosing Ginkgo can bring automation, scale, and codebase beyond their own; potential customers who are considering but have not yet built lab-scale capabilities where a partnership with Ginkgo allows them to spend their capital on commercialization efforts; and potential customers who are not yet working in synthetic biology whose industries or products stand to be disrupted by biological solutions. Our business development team, with support from our Codebase and Foundry team members, crafts solutions for each of these types of customers through a strategic discussion of customer needs and fit with Ginkgo capabilities.
To grow existing customers, our alliance management and business development teams work closely with customers to identify technical and business opportunities that serve as the basis for consideration of future programs. Through these discussions, our existing customers often bring upcoming strategic R&D needs to our attention.

Over 160 Cumulative Programs across diverse industries have run on our platform
While most biotechnology companies focus on building products within a fairly narrow scope, Ginkgo has uniquely pursued a partnered strategy across all end markets. This was not easy. For many years, our platform was less efficient than the status quo of an expert scientist working by-hand at a lab bench. In the early days, the only end markets willing to take a chance on our platform were those without in-house biotechnology capabilities. But as Ginkgo’s platform improved over time and with scale, we were able to win contracts in increasingly sophisticated end markets with more in-house biotechnology expertise. Today, our platform is diversified across all major end markets with marquee customers and a range of focus areas within each.



Figure 6: Cumulative Programs run by third-party customers on Ginkgo’s platform (excluding proof of concept projects and other exploratory work). Today, Ginkgo has a diverse set of programs across all major end markets.
Our customers include large multinational organizations with multibillion dollar R&D budgets as well as startups who are depending on us for essentially all of their bioengineering needs. While these customers and their focus areas may look very different, they are all important and valuable to Ginkgo. All of these programs leverage a common infrastructure, and as we demonstrate the value of this platform, we have the ability to grow significantly with our customers.

Ability to grow with our customers and increasingly complement existing R&D budgets
Ginkgo has grown substantially through inside sales with our existing customers. Some of our customers forego building their own lab space in favor of outsourcing all of their cell engineering needs and so when they grow and expand their product pipeline, we expect their demand for our platform to increase. We believe the relative value of our platform compared to the next best option (building a lab, bioengineering team, and intellectual property from scratch) is immense, which helps us retain customers in this category.
Other customers may already have in-house cell programming capabilities. As Ginkgo demonstrates the value-add of our platform by successfully delivering on programs, we have the opportunity to grow our collaborations with them, complementing their core R&D capabilities. We don’t view this as a “replacement” of customer scientists with Ginkgo’s platform. Rather, we hope to expand our customers’ capacity and need for innovation—giving them more “shots on goal” and enabling them to invest more heavily in R&D as the return on investment of each dollar spent increases.
We have demonstrated our ability to “land and expand” with several customers. With one customer, an initial proof of concept program has turned into a broader strategic relationship with 11 programs today. With another, we launched a relationship with two programs, quickly expanding it to five by the end of the following year. While this initially drove some customer concentration, that has naturally decreased as we’ve scaled and added new customers to the platform. During 2022,

two of our customers each contributed greater than 10% of revenue and collectively they accounted for 22% of total revenue, down from 28% in 2021. With the addition of new customers, we believe customer concentration will decline over time even as we expect to continue to grow our relationships with existing large customers. However, our ability to grow with our customers requires us to maintain satisfied customers, and program or other operational setbacks could impede our ability to meet customer expectations and grow our business.
 Powerful proof points across categories
Our platform has now been validated by sophisticated customers across a range of industries. As we launch programs in new areas, those provide a toehold for future sales in that space. As an example, our pro bono project for Moderna, Inc. ("Moderna") at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to enhance production of a key raw ingredient through process engineering provided a proof point and initiated us into this emerging segment, leading to a commercial relationship with another nucleic acid vaccine company, as well as a program to produce a key processing enzyme for mRNA vaccines. Biopharma discovery programs remain the hardest area to break into as our customers have strong in-house capabilities and many specialized competitors exist in this area. In the last 12-18 months, however, we have been able to demonstrate powerful data and capabilities that have enabled us to sign programs with leading biopharma companies such as Biogen, Merck, and Novo Nordisk.
Our Platform
Ginkgo’s platform combines a strong technical foundation with an ecosystem of supporting resources to maximize our partners’ odds of technical and commercial success. In the nucleus of our platform are our Foundry and Codebase, which our scientists leverage to complete customer programs. The Foundry is, in its simplest form, a very large, highly efficient biology lab, enabled by over a decade of investment in proprietary workflows, custom software, robotic automation, and data science and analytics. It is paired with our Codebase, a collection of biological “parts” and a database of biological data, which helps our scientists program cells. But great technology alone is not enough, and we are building a community and ecosystem around our technical platform that provides our partners with end-to-end support.

Our Foundry brings economies of scale to cell programming
Cell programming projects involve a conceptually similar process regardless of the specific product or market. Based on customer specifications, Ginkgo’s program team develops designs of proteins, pathways and gene networks (see Figure 5) that might meet the specification, leveraging public and proprietary biological knowledge bases (see “—Our Codebase—organizing the world’s biological code”). Those conceptual designs are refined and specified into particular DNA sequences using computer-aided design tools. Those DNA sequences are then chemically synthesized and inserted into a cell to execute the new DNA code. These prototype cells are then studied and the output or performance of each is measured and compared to the customer’s desired specification. Learnings using data analytics and data science tools can inform a new round of prototypes, if needed. We refer to this engineering cycle from design to learning as a campaign and we perform campaigns both in parallel and serially until either the specification has been met or the customer decides to end the program.
The likelihood of technical success increases with each iterative campaign and with the number of prototypes that are explored per campaign. However, with traditional tools for genetic engineering, each campaign can be slow, expensive and error prone. Many projects across the industry run out of budget or time. Conventional R&D teams often look to stay within budget by running rapid campaigns using largely manual tools and small numbers of prototypes per campaign. However, the inability to broadly explore the potential design space (there are more possible sequences of a 200 amino acid protein encoded in 600 DNA letters than there are stars in the observable universe) and the reliance on manual tools is a difficult handicap to overcome. Since people can only work so hard and since campaigns can’t be shortened beyond the duration of the physical steps, this approach has limited potential to improve in the future.
At Ginkgo, we invest in improving the tools and technology for programming cells in order to maximize program success within the constraints of customer timelines and budgets. We do so by scaling the number of prototypes that can be evaluated in each campaign in an effort to reduce the number of campaigns required to meet the customer’s specification and ultimately shorten project timelines. A typical campaign for one enzyme step in a program might evaluate 1,000 to 2,000 prototypes to optimize function, of which the top 10 to 100 might be short-listed for further study. A relatively basic program might have three to five enzymes working in concert, and so in the process of optimizing the entire pathway, thousands or tens of thousands of enzymes and pathway combinations might be designed, built, and tested in the Foundry. The methods we use to increase scale also tend to reduce the average cost per prototype, which means that more prototypes can be evaluated for a given program budget.

Because diverse cell programs share similarities in process and code, many programs can be run simultaneously in a carefully designed centralized facility. This facility, where we use our investments in advanced cell programming technologies to manage diverse programs, is what we call our Foundry.
We make it possible to centralize many cell programming projects in our Foundry by deconstructing programs into a set of common steps and then standardizing those steps. For each step, we have built a specialized functional team that performs that step for all programs. Those teams define a set of standardized services that can be used in concert to execute an end-to-end cell programming process. Each team has access to scientific, software, and robotic engineering resources to replace manual ad hoc operations with standardized, automated, and optimized services. In addition to enabling scale, this approach ensures standard operating procedures, know-how, and human skill become encoded in software that can be more effectively debugged, monitored, controlled, and optimized.



Figure 7: A non-exhaustive summary of the functions performed throughout the lifecycle of a program in the Foundry. At each stage, learnings are generated, driving improved designs and functional optimizations.
While the engineering strategies described above have historically been relatively uncommon in the life sciences, they are obviously not our invention. Rather, we are inspired by the lessons from other engineering disciplines and seek to apply those to biology. Automotive manufacturing, semiconductor fabrication, and data centers, among many other industries, demonstrate how automation, data, economies of scale, and continuous improvement can produce compounding gains in scale, costs, and quality. Critically, routine performance of these strategies across dozens of projects gives us the data and experience needed to drive continuous improvement.
As described above, a key strategy in our Foundry is to increase the scale of our operations so that we can run larger campaigns, a greater number of campaigns, and hence run more programs. This approach benefits from operational efficiencies and economies of scale across many dimensions:
●Fixed Cost Amortization: Our Foundry is an inherently physical facility and as we scale and improve utilization, we are able to amortize this fixed cost across more work. 
 ●Continuous Learning and Improvement: The cumulative amount of work done as we scale leads to a better understanding about how to program cells. Much of this is then encoded in our Codebase, described below.
 ●Purchasing Economies: By partnering with Ginkgo, our technology partners and suppliers can generate more value from a single account than they could from multiple smaller accounts, and that extra value is shared with Ginkgo. 
 ●Technology Specialization: Certain technologies that we leverage in the Foundry (such as acoustic liquid handling, automated bioreactors, and advanced mass spectrometry systems) are not easily leveraged or practical for smaller organizations. But for an engineering organization of our size, those investments can drive material improvements in cost efficiency.
 
These efficiencies and economies of scale can be observed empirically from a relationship we refer to as “Knight’s Law,” named after Tom Knight, one of our co-founders, and loosely inspired by Moore’s Law for semiconductors. As shown below, we have seen a significant increase in the output of the Foundry over time alongside a significant decline in the average cost per unit of output except during temporary lab shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced capacity due to social

distancing. In 2022, we continued to see significant year-over-year improvements in Foundry output and cost per unit as measured by strain tests, a metric related to the number of prototypes evaluated across all active programs. While strain tests offer one useful measure of Foundry output, we intend to evolve our metrics relating to Knight’s Law to provide what we believe to be a more dispositive snapshot of the true output of our Foundry as it evolves. For example, campaigns using the FGen and Altar technologies we acquired in 2022 are useful to advance certain programs but they do not generate strain tests due to the stringent definition we use for strain tests. Thus, campaigns are a higher level and more generic unit of Foundry output than strain tests. We plan to monitor and assess whether a metric such as number of campaigns serves as a useful metric for Foundry output that may complement our current low-level metric (strain tests) and high-level metric (New Programs).
 Knight’s Law does not provide the full story on our development, but it is a useful tool that allows us to continue to build efficiencies of scale. We believe we can continue to drive significant capacity growth in the foreseeable future, though it is dependent on the development of new technologies, which inherently carries risk, and, like Moore’s Law, we will likely hit a limit over time. This feature compares to a conventional facility, where scaling is driven predominantly by the addition of employees, an exponential increase in work would be infeasible and the cost per unit of work would decline little, if at all.



Figure 8: The output of the platform as measured by daily strain tests increased by well over 2X in 2022 following growth of over 3X per year during the preceding several years (with the exception of 2020). While we expect significant scaling to continue, there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so.




Figure 9: As the output of the platform has increased, our total R&D / operational costs per unit of output has decreased by approximately 30% in 2022 and approximately 50% per year during the preceding several years (with the exception of 2020).
We are frequently asked, and spend much time thinking about, whether it will be possible for compounding gains in output and productivity to continue for many years in the future. It is important to note that given significantly advanced tools, most steps in cell programming could be miniaturized to a point where single molecules of DNA and single cells are being manipulated and monitored. At that ultimate degree of miniaturization, the costs and timelines of cell programming could be reduced orders of magnitude from where they are today. Microfluidic and encapsulation technologies point to the reality of this future of cell programming at the single-cell level. Additionally, because many of the enabling tools of cell programming are biological in nature (e.g., polymerases and CRISPR), we are able to point the platform at itself, developing new biological tools to reduce the number of steps or the complexity of a certain operation. For example, we could develop better gene editing enzymes or novel ways to screen cells in a multiplexed format using biological sensors. It is easy to theorize about these types of developments, however they are hard to execute, we will undoubtedly run into roadblocks along the way and we will have to invest significantly in developing new technologies in order to enable the types of improvements we seek to achieve.
Recent advances in machine learning, molecular simulation, and other computational techniques also hold great promise to improve our ability to program cells. We believe our Foundry is well-positioned to build the kind of large, well-structured datasets that such computational approaches need to succeed. In time, we believe computational approaches will reduce the need for certain kinds of experiments (for example, we already use machine learning to make protein and enzyme design projects more efficient). If computational approaches can replace certain sets of experiments, we expect to use the recovered Foundry capacity to work on ever-more complex cell programming challenges. The reality is that the cells that we program today accomplish relatively simple functions, such as: “produce as much of molecule X as possible.” Programming cells for complex functions, such as live-cell therapeutics, responsive building materials, multicellular organisms, etc., will require sophisticated sub-systems for environmental sensing, intracellular information processing and feedback, and a multidimensional program that responds to such environmental stimuli. Only when we can deliver such sophisticated

programmed cells will we have truly unlocked the potential of biology, and we see the Foundry as being an integral part of the platform for doing so.
Our Codebase—organizing the world’s biological code
Codebase is a familiar term to software developers but is a new concept in biology. Modern software firms develop their own (typically proprietary) codebase of source code and code libraries that can be leveraged by their software developers to more easily create new applications than they could starting from scratch. Additionally, vast repositories of debugged code are shared publicly so that programmers across application areas can leverage prior art in order to innovate faster. This allows software developers to focus their time and effort on developing new features rather than recreating existing logic. Ginkgo’s Codebase consists of reusable genetic parts and strains that can be repurposed in new cell programs as well as vast datasets mapping genotype to phenotype. We are continually investing in better ways to characterize functional biological code to drive increased reusability. In addition to the raw performance data we generate through our Foundry experiments (approximately 70 million strain tests run in 2022), we have also incorporated many public databases for protein sequences and, together with proprietary databases, have amassed a data set of approximately 5.7 billion unique protein sequences that we leverage in our designs.
Engineering biology is complex—one of the reasons that Foundry scale is important is that it remains highly difficult to predict the performance of a biological “part” in a given context from a DNA sequence alone. The genomics revolution has outpaced biologists’ ability to test the functionality of each DNA sequence as it was discovered, particularly because most of the community is still performing biological experiments by hand without the benefit of automation. Each program performed at Ginkgo involves testing thousands or millions of DNA sequences; with a small fraction of those ending up in our final engineered cells. For that reason, high-performance biological sequences—the handful of designs from thousands of candidate designs that meet our performance goals for an experiment—are hard-won assets and form a key component of Ginkgo’s Codebase. Not to be discounted, the “losing” designs are still valuable, helping inform more effective campaigns in the future that avoid known failure modes. 


Figure 10: Our Codebase incorporates both biological assets from nature as well as engineered assets and data from our Foundry experiments. Because the Foundry enables us to test many thousands of prototype enzymes, pathways, and strains in individual engineering cycles, we are able to quickly expand the range of characterized biological assets in our Codebase.
In some ways Codebase is a “parts catalog” that we can draw from when developing a new organism. As Ginkgo performs more projects, we contribute new parts to our Codebase that can be reused in new contexts. For example, we developed novel synthetic promoters (DNA sequences that can turn on the expression of a gene of interest) that allowed us to increase production of proteins in yeast. Initially, we tested thousands of designs to arrive at a select number of promoters with high performance. Now those high-performing promoters can be reused in any program that involves producing a protein in yeast; they are a modular piece of genetic code. Over the past 20 years, our team has supported efforts to build these kinds of parts libraries—the International Genetically Engineered Machine (“iGEM”) Parts Registry and AddGene are two notable examples of initiatives to make reusable parts available to researchers in the community. But despite these efforts, we continue to see intellectual property siloed within organizations across the biotechnology industry, leaving many without the additional intellectual property they need to develop their programs. Ginkgo’s Codebase allows our customers to draw from a broader set of biological assets than any single company would develop for a given application. The scale and diversity of our programs have allowed us to develop a large Codebase that grows with the addition of each new program and can be opened to the broad swath of partners and cell programmers using our platform.

Cell programmers must consider not only the genes in the programs that they design, but also the ways that they interact with the cell that “runs” the program. Therefore, Codebase is more than just the individual modular parts we use to design biological programs. The organisms that have been optimized to run the programs, whether because they have been engineered for robust growth or because they are particularly adept at producing certain classes of products, are known as “chassis” strains. These strains can be reused across multiple programs, significantly reducing the amount of work needed to optimize a program and engineer a commercially viable organism. The breadth of Ginkgo’s customer base allows us to use these chassis strains in many more contexts than traditional industrial biotech players.
For example:
●Our collaboration with Cronos involves the production of many different cannabinoids; these cannabinoids share common precursor molecules such that a single chassis strain can be modified to produce each product. 
 ●In 2021, Ginkgo acquired Dutch DNA Biotech B.V. This team specializes in the development of filamentous fungi for protein production. Traditionally, filamentous fungi have been used for the production of industrial enzymes—typically enzymes that are native to fungi or close relatives. At Ginkgo, these fungal strains are being engineered to produce a broad range of proteins, including bacterial and mammalian proteins. These proteins are applicable to a wide range of end products, such as food and materials.
 ●In 2022, Ginkgo acquired Zymergen, a company with extensive codebase assets of their own, including engineered chassis strains and over one billion proprietary gene sequences used for gene discovery. These assets were originally developed for applications in novel materials, drug discovery, and agriculture, and are being broadly repurposed across Ginkgo’s portfolio. 
 ●In 2022, Ginkgo announced a new cell programming project with Sumitomo to produce a target molecule for the personal care and cosmetic industries. The target molecule is envisioned to augment or replace one that is otherwise currently gathered from animal sources. This program was selected in part due to the availability of a precursor molecule in Ginkgo’s Codebase. 
 ●In 2022, Ginkgo acquired Circularis, a company with a proprietary screening platform for genetic regulatory elements based on a circular RNA transcriptional reporter. The acquisition provided large sets of promoters and other regulatory elements whose performance has been assessed in multiple mammalian cell lines. The platform is being integrated into the Foundry to accelerate screening of regulatory elements and the circularization technology is being used to develop circular RNA for therapeutic purposes.
 ●We aim to re-deploy Codebase assets in new contexts. In 2021, we launched our “Cell Development Kit” (“CDK”) product offering. Inspired by “Software Development Kits” (“SDKs”) used in the software industry, CDKs offer a standardized entry point for Ginkgo to input new projects on the Ginkgo platform. The first CDKs to launch are focused on protein expression programs. CDKs provide cell programmers access to the toolkit needed to get started developing commercial proteins, including access to pre-engineered host cells optimized for such protein production, specialized equipment, automation capabilities, genetic engineering expertise, insights garnered from Ginkgo’s Codebase and the applicable infrastructure to design, build and test a custom protein production microbe. 
 ●Ginkgo’s CDKs are designed to cut the cost of launching a cell program and speed up development timelines to build engineered microbes, for example, to determine whether a protein may be successfully and commercially produced. By simplifying the pathway for companies to get started on the Ginkgo platform with standard terms, a phased approach, low costs and clear deliverables, the CDK can help de-risk projects prior to full scale technical development. In effect, CDKs allow us to more efficiently deploy useful Codebase and the cell engineering know-how we have accumulated to add new projects to the platform.
 Our Foundry and Codebase are inextricably linked. Our Foundry scale allows us to generate unparalleled Codebase assets. These Codebase assets help us improve our designs and provide reusable parts and chassis strains that improve the efficiency and probability of success of our cell programming efforts in the Foundry. As the capabilities of the platform improve, it drives further demand, which increases the rate of learning in our Codebase. The continuous learning and improvements inherent in this relationship is one of the key features of our platform.



Figure 11: We believe our initial CDKs can help cell programmers build proof-of-concept strains faster.
An ecosystem to support cell programmers
 Ginkgo has long recognized that it is critical to build a true ecosystem around our technical platform. We have been inspired by the leading horizontal platforms in information technology, such as Microsoft Windows and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), which built real developer communities and provided a range of value-added services on top of their core technology. Like these pathbreakers, who set the stage for a generation of computer developers, we too are trying to ensure that the cell programmers who build applications on our platform have the tools they need to succeed beyond the lab.
 



Figure 12: Ginkgo strives to create an ecosystem to ensure that cell programmers have the tools they need to succeed.
Access to capital
As in the early days of computer programming, it is still extremely expensive to program biology. For that reason, it can be easier for larger companies to make investments in innovation around this space. But Ginkgo’s platform gives small companies and innovators access to the same horsepower as larger players and obviates the need to invest in fixed laboratory assets, providing an even greater strategic benefit. To help address this discrepancy, Ginkgo has assisted in launching new companies (such as Motif and Arcaea) by bringing together strategic and financial investors to secure funding for these early stage companies. While we maintain a conservative approach to cash management, we are able to leverage our capacity and partner with investors to enable companies at all stages to benefit from our platform. We believe that, as Ginkgo’s customers demonstrate increasing success, there will be an explosion of capital for cell programming applications and a recognition of Ginkgo’s platform as setting the industry standard and providing the backbone for these development efforts. In a challenging capital markets environment, such as the one we have experienced in 2022, access to capital becomes an even bigger challenge for emerging companies. While we remain thoughtful around ensuring a healthy mix of large and small customers, our value proposition to emerging companies has continued to expand significantly.
 Manufacturing support
Our job is to ensure that our cell programs can be executed at scale and we support our customers to ensure successful commercial scale manufacturing. We have built relationships with a number of leading contract manufacturing organizations and have demonstrated that we can transfer our lab-developed protocols to commercial scale (e.g., 50,000+ L fermentation tanks) with predictable performance. We have an in-house deployment team dedicated to supporting our customers’ scale-up and downstream processing needs. We have even helped certain customers, such as Cronos acquire and build out their own in-house manufacturing capabilities and certain programs, such as our work with Moderna, focus on manufacturing process optimization.
In 2022, we acquired Bayer’s West Sacramento agricultural biologicals R&D facility, which included robust pilot manufacturing infrastructure for microbial strains, with room to grow. We plan to continue to invest in this capability, helping bridge the gap for our customers between R&D and commercial production.
 Intellectual property protection and regulatory support
Ginkgo takes responsibility for the cell engineering intellectual property generated through customer collaborations. Our scientific team collaborates with our customers and with Ginkgo’s intellectual property team to file patent applications and

monitor collaboration deliverables for freedom to operate. We are also active in the evolving regulatory landscape for biological engineering. While our customers are responsible for handling their own regulatory procedures on a product-by-product basis, our broader view can help build understanding of and support for novel product classes.
Building a community of cell programmers
We launched Ferment, our annual conference, in 2018. The conference highlights developments and thought leadership in the field and brings together scientists, entrepreneurs, investors, and suppliers, and we look forward to hosting our next Ferment in April 2023. Even prior to launching Ginkgo, our founders focused on building community within the emerging field of cell programming. Tom Knight, one of our founders, was among the professors who launched the iGEM Competition in 2004, which has now had over 70,000 participants from over 40 countries take part in the competition (including dozens of Ginkgo employees and all five founders!).
Facilitating partnerships within our community
Because Ginkgo serves both large market incumbents and smaller startups, our community also serves to facilitate introductions between innovators and those looking to invest in innovation. We believe that investors and large strategic companies have come to recognize Ginkgo’s platform as a key enabler of innovation and are keen to get to know the companies that are building with us. Those relationships can be the source of funding and go-to-market support for the earlier stage companies building on the platform, increasing the odds that they develop successful products.
We invest in building trust and credibility for the entire industry
The most powerful technologies require the most care. Biology is too powerful for us to not care about how our platform is used. We have and will continue to invest heavily to build and maintain trust in bioengineering as a technology platform across all layers of the industry. At the platform layer, we have focused on building robust biosecurity measures. At the application layer, we are proud to enable a diverse set of programs that drive towards environmental sustainability. We are committed to ESG practices and broad stakeholder engagement at a corporate level. We are also engaged in deep conversations around the implications and ethics of biotechnologies through many public forums, helping shape our platform to promote sustainability in our global community.
Biosecurity: An imperative for our platform and demonstrated source of value
 With a mission to make biology easier to engineer, we have always recognized the need to invest in biosecurity as a key component of our platform. We’re building the future bioeconomy with our customers and partners, and we envision the future of biosecurity as a global immune system equipped with the capabilities to prevent, detect, and respond to biological threats. The first, critical step in realizing this future is to build a robust early warning system for biological threats—this is the primary focus of Ginkgo’s biosecurity and public health unit, Concentric by Ginkgo.
 The COVID-19 pandemic created a renewed sense of urgency for the need to counter biological risk, deepening our resolve and leading us to accelerate our early warning capabilities. Beginning in 2020, Concentric built a large-scale, end-to-end testing network that has empowered communities and public health leaders at the local, state, and federal levels to make informed decisions as the pandemic has continued to evolve. As part of this work, we launched large-scale efforts in K-12 schools in many U.S. states and partnered with Eurofins’ Clinical Enterprise to support the federal Operation Expanded Testing program in providing free, low-burden testing solutions in underserved and high-risk communities, such as schools and early childhood education centers, long-term care communities, and corrections facilities.
 



Figure 13: Concentric’s pathogen monitoring network has conducted testing in communities across most of the U.S.
 
This network is now forming the foundation for a global, real-time biological threat monitoring network. As we grow this network, we are maturing our platform capabilities in several key ways:
 ●Expanding to multiple pathogen targets and laying the groundwork for threat-agnostic approaches;
 ●Diversifying our sampling modalities from nasal swab and saliva samples to more passive approaches that take environmental samples from wastewater and air;
 ●Maturing our bioinformatics offering and adding enhanced analytic modules, such as Engineered Nucleotide Detection and Ranking (“ENDAR"), a computational platform to detect engineered biology that was developed in collaboration with the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (“IARPA”); and
 ●Adding state-of-the-art epidemiological data infrastructure through an asset purchase from Baktus, Inc., that enables us to track, model, and forecast epidemics and associated risks and impacts.
 


Figure 14: Concentric’s growing platform for real-time biological threat monitoring will work like an "operating system" for biosecurity, managing the underlying capabilities, networks, and data infrastructure needed for a flexible combination of biomonitoring solutions.

We have reached several key milestones in the expansion of our global biosecurity network in the past year, including:
 ●Growing the Traveler-Based Genomic Surveillance program, an initiative to identify emerging viral variants by sampling arriving international travelers at major airports, in partnership with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) and XpresCheck. The program continued to deliver early insights into emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants like BQ.1.1, A.2.75.2, XBB, and CH.1.1, announced expansion to three additional airport locations to address winter surges in late 2022 (to a total of seven airports), and began sampling for influenza A and B alongside SARS-CoV-2. 
 ●Partnering with communities to run a series of passive monitoring pilots to optimize methodology and insights delivery. These pilots explore opportunities to mitigate risk in vulnerable community settings, incorporate passive monitoring data into layered strategies alongside testing, and leverage rural schools as a public health sentinel in areas lacking centralized municipal wastewater systems.
 ●Laying the groundwork for international expansion through a series of biosecurity-focused Memoranda of Understanding with partners in Qatar, Rwanda, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the Republic of Botswana (building on prior agreements with the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and mRNA Victoria). We are in the process of developing aircraft wastewater monitoring programs in Rwanda and Qatar.
 In addition to these biological threat detection efforts, we are also engaged in prevention and response efforts. Ginkgo is a longtime member of the International Gene Synthesis Consortium, and as mentioned above, we recently completed a project with IARPA to develop a biodetection tool that can serve as a deterrent for bad actors seeking to engineer biology for malicious purposes. We have also continued and renewed our efforts to support the development of medical countermeasures like vaccines and therapeutics. Early in the pandemic, we launched partnerships with Moderna and Aldevron to support mRNA vaccine manufacturing. In the past year, we’ve built partnerships with key biopharma industry leaders like Novo Nordisk and Merck and invested in enhancing our capabilities to help deliver innovative therapeutics.
 Our Business Model
The key input into our unit economics is a cell program. For each of these cell programs, we generate economic value in two primary ways. First, we charge usage fees for Foundry services, in much the same way that cloud computing companies charge usage fees for utilization of computing capacity or CROs charge for services. Additionally, we negotiate a value share with our customers (typically in the form of royalties, milestones, and/or equity interests) in order to align our economics with the success of the programs enabled by our platform. As we add new programs, our portfolio of programs with this “downstream” value potential grows. Because we typically do not incur material downstream costs (e.g., manufacturing or product development, which our customers manage), these value share payments flow through with approximately 100% contribution margin. This flexible business model allows for more predictable near-term revenue without sacrificing our ability to create long-term value with asymmetric upside.
Foundry (or Cell Engineering) Revenue
 Illustrative Program Economics


Figure 15: Ginkgo generates economics from programs in two primary ways. First, customers pay upfront fees to cover initial R&D costs for a program. Second, Ginkgo shares in the downstream value (typically in the form of a royalty stream, milestone, and/or equity share) generated by programs.
Foundry (or Cell Engineering) Usage Fees
The first stage of a cell program consists of R&D work being performed on Ginkgo’s platform, leveraging our Foundry and Codebase. R&D is inherently risky and our customers recognize that this is a cost they will incur regardless of success and whether they are working on the program in-house or with a partner. Ginkgo provides a much more efficient platform to conduct this R&D work, encouraging companies to build on or adopt our platform.
We estimate that the unit costs of our Foundry cell engineering services are several times less expensive on average than the status quo (a customer doing equivalent R&D in-house, by-hand) and we expect that cost advantage to grow over time. We typically earn usage fees tied to the units of work that we perform on behalf of our customers’ programs and as our platform matures, we would expect our growing cost advantage to enable us to fully cover our direct costs, eventually enabling us to earn a modest margin. Foundry usage fees provide a strong foundation of predictable revenue that is independent of any commercialization efforts by our partners.
As we continue to scale the Foundry and build Codebase, we expect to drive further efficiencies and decrease our average unit costs. This presents us with a strategic choice going forward. We could retain these efficiencies and increase our margins or we could pass these efficiencies on to our customers, increasing the number of shots on goal and, therefore, the likelihood of program success given a fixed budget. We believe the right choice for long-term value creation is to pass the savings to our customers, reducing the barriers to adoption and driving increased demand for our platform. Our Foundry usage fees are thus impacted by a number of drivers:
●Number of active programs: We hope to dramatically increase the number of programs working on our platform over time, and if we are successful, we believe this will drive increasing usage fees. 
 ●Units of work per program per year: If our Foundry becomes more efficient and we generate more scale, we expect to be able to do more work per program in a fixed period of time, improving chances of program success. 
 ●Average price per unit of work: If we bring on innovative technologies or step change improvements in existing Foundry services, we plan to pass capability and cost improvements on to our customers. If these new technologies or services are adopted across programs, we believe the average price per unit of work will fall over time. 
 ●Number of years per program: If our platform improves, we expect program duration to decrease over time. Some programs may still be charting new territories and take several years, but programs that are able to leverage substantial pre-existing Codebase (e.g., our Nth program in bulk protein production) should have shorter duration and, in general, greater Foundry capabilities should shorten program durations.


The expected impact of these drivers is represented below:


Figure 16: Illustrative drivers of Ginkgo’s long-term financial model and customer value proposition.

The multi-year nature of an average cell programming project means that our usage fees are recurring in nature. Additionally, given the lead times inherent in developing technical plans as part of a sales process, we have good visibility into new Foundry usage fee bookings. This provides a strong foundation for the business and allows us to be patient while we wait for downstream economics.
Downstream Value Share
As the key enabling technology for our customers’ products, we are able to earn a share of the value of the products that are created using our platform, an important component of the financial potential of most cell programs. We are quite flexible and have structured a variety of value sharing mechanisms, including royalties, equity, and lump-sum milestone payments. Because the economics to us should be roughly equivalent, we are generally agnostic on which form of downstream value capture we receive and the decision is typically based on customer size and preference.
Because Ginkgo typically will have completed the program (and received associated usage fees) prior to realizing downstream value, cash flows from the downstream value capture component generally fall straight to the bottom line as we incur minimal to no ongoing support or delivery costs once the strain is commercialized. This dynamic creates opportunities for outsized returns as our clients successfully commercialize products built on our platform. As we add more programs to the platform over time, we expect downstream value share to contribute income, and therefore we believe our overall margins and cash flow profile will grow significantly. The realization of potential revenue related to downstream value in the form of potential future milestone payments and royalties and/or equity consideration is dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to successfully develop engineered cells, bioprocesses, data packages, or other deliverables, and the product development and commercialization success of our customers.
Biosecurity Revenue
In the second quarter of 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we launched our commercial offering of COVID-19 testing products and services for businesses, academic institutions, and other organizations in which we generate product and service revenue. We generate product revenue through the sale of lateral flow assay (“LFA”) diagnostic test kits, PCR sample collection kits and pooled test kits, all of which we sell to our customers on a standalone basis. We generate service revenue primarily through the sale of our end-to-end COVID-19 testing services which consist of multiple promised goods and services including sample collection kits, physician authorizations, onsite test administration, outsourced laboratory PCR analysis, and access to results reported through a web-based portal.
Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, we launched our pooled testing initiative which focuses on providing end-to-end COVID-19 testing and reporting services to public health authorities. We are currently offering pooled testing and reporting services for K-12 schools across the United States, at airports through our partnership with XpresCheck and the CDC, as well as through other congregate settings such as our partnership with Eurofins. Our COVID-19 testing business is subject to seasonality, and the demand for COVID-19 testing in schools is diminished, particularly in light of the White House's announcement that the public health emergency will end in May 2023. Over time, Concentric by Ginkgo has added new offerings such as wastewater monitoring and bioinformatic support and has expanded internationally. These expanded offerings were not a material portion of our revenue in 2022, but we expect their relative value to increase in future years.
Our Sustainable Advantage
We have defined a unique business model over the past 15 years. The biotechnology industry has been product-centric for decades, with early horizontal platforms in life sciences frequently vertically integrating upon the development of the first

successful product on their platform. As Ginkgo has embarked on this journey, we have studied and learned from innovators and established platform companies in other industries as we built our platform and business. We now benefit from significant historical investments, a virtuous cycle that grows with scale, and a strong business model that is aligned with our customers’ outcomes. These establish a strong sustainable advantage that we believe will help establish Ginkgo as a true industry standard.
Decade-plus head start in creating an industry standard platform
Hardware, software and biological tools need to be tightly integrated to replicate our platform. We have spent over 15 years building the software, automation and data science to best support a high throughput, generalized platform and expect to continue investing in this area. Our software, automation and data infrastructure cannot be easily replicated without bringing together a number of rare, specialized skill sets. In addition, without the scale and demand to stress test a high throughput platform, we expect any newly developed platform would be suboptimal. We estimate that it took us over eight years of investment and iteration to reach cost parity with “by hand” cell programming. We believe competitors will find it difficult to justify the investment in the software, automation and data science needed for high throughput operations before they acquire matching high demand.
Scale economics provide a structural cost advantage
As the only scaled horizontal platform in this space, we have the broadest number of programs that can be run on our platform, providing the highest potential for scale economics. Other companies choose to target specific markets and vertically integrate into products with high expected value. This has a tendency to overfit the capabilities of their R&D team to their targets. As discussed above, our continued scaling and investment in flexible tools that can apply to a broad range of end markets helps us drive efficiencies in the Foundry and Codebase across our diverse programs. Furthermore, as we scale, we are able to leverage advanced technologies that are only practical at scale and also may obtain preferred pricing with a number of suppliers. Competitors may be unable to source equivalent technology or negotiate similar pricing without first achieving scale, a feat that is difficult to do with a narrowly focused R&D platform.
Strong network and learning effects
In addition to a raw scale economic, we also accumulate knowledge and reusable Codebase from each program that runs on the platform. Every program benefits from the programs that came before and generates benefits for other current and future programs. These learnings and reusable assets are cumulative, extremely hard to replicate, and increasingly valuable to our customers. Because our learnings are generated by the work we execute in our Foundry, the scaling in our Foundry drives a scaling in our rate of learning. Thus, there is a recursive element to our platform: as the platform gets better, it also improves faster—we are excited to make this advantage of our platform available to our ecosystem of cell programmers.
Ginkgo’s value creation is aligned closely with customer success
Our platform drives value for customers along two dimensions: reducing the cost of laboratory work via automation and increasing the probability of technical success due to cumulative data and learnings. Our financial model is aligned with those factors. As we gain efficiency, we drive further demand for cell programming, which drives our Foundry revenue up. As both demand and probability of success increase, our risk-adjusted value share also increases. Our model only requires we share in a small fraction of the downstream value created by our programs, providing our customers the opportunity to generate and retain significant value. Ultimately, this encourages broader adoption of our platform across industries.

Furthermore, we seek to maintain close relationships with our customers, supporting their work, and earning their loyalty and satisfaction. The breadth and highly integrated nature of our platform makes it inefficient for a customer to simultaneously work with Ginkgo and any theoretical competitor. As there is not yet a standard interface for cell programming, it requires an upfront investment to learn how to choose and design programs to make the best use of our platform. Thus, customer retention is high and there are substantial switching costs.
We are uniquely positioned to attract the top cell programmers
Just as the top software programmers want to work with the latest technologies, we believe the top cell programmers will be attracted to our industry leading platform and access to its unique capabilities. Our ability to hire and retain the best cell programmers as internal users and developers of our platform pushes us to continually improve and also builds a base of Ginkgo-trained experts. If these Ginkgo trained cell programmers move on to roles and opportunities in product-specific

companies, we expect they will become ambassadors for the Ginkgo approach in their next role, expanding our reach into potential customers.
History of investing in credibility and trust
Let’s face it, GMOs have an image problem. This image problem has led to activities by the first generation of genetic engineering companies that backfired: lobbying against transparency in labeling laws, trying to “rebrand” GMOs with different terminology, and other efforts that have failed to build trust and engagement with stakeholders. We have taken a different approach. Rather than avoid the term, we’ve championed transparent labeling, sought to engage and build trust through open dialog, and enthusiastically embraced the potential for GMOs to do great things. We don’t seek to make GMOs acceptable through branding; we aim to make GMOs that people love.



Figure 17: Ginkgo seeks to make GMOs that people love.
 Doing so requires care and attention to both the technical and social aspects of our platform and its impacts. This means investing in biosecurity and, as noted above, embedding it into our platform and how we operate. This also means engaging with the social complexities of science and technology with a diverse group of people. We strive for a company culture based on a foundation of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (see also the sections titled “—The Impact of Cell Programming—ESG is in our DNA” and “—Our People & Culture”), and aim to engage different perspectives through our creative residency and through our magazine, Grow. Through both our internal and external efforts, we seek to engage with the realities of what has made genetic engineering an ESG risk historically, and work towards equitable and positive impact.

Our Growth Strategy
We are seeking to usher in a new paradigm for cell programming. It took us over eight years of basic research and investment in software, automation, data science and scale to reach parity with the status quo of individual scientists conducting experiments by hand at a lab bench. It took us several more years to demonstrate business model maturity: delivering a platform with enough value-add to customers that we could cover the cost of cell engineering R&D programs while building Codebase and sharing in the downstream value of our programs. We believe that we are now at an inflection point where we have the opportunity to become the industry standard. We see several drivers of this evolution and growth.
Scale our platform and continue to drive efficiencies and improvements
As discussed above, our platform improves with scale and to date we have observed a positive feedback loop between our Foundry and Codebase. As we scale capacity and demand on the Foundry, we expect our average unit costs to fall, creating a better value proposition for our customers as their program budgets stretch further and drive more demand. Similarly, Foundry output also grows our Codebase, which supports better program execution, creating a better value proposition for our customers as well.

We occupy over 325,000 square feet at our headquarters and maintain state-of-the-art machinery and laboratory equipment. We have built more than 50 custom integrated work cells, consisting of robotic automation systems, mass spectrometry, fermenters, sequencers, and more. We have the capabilities to engineer dozens of species of organisms from bacteria to fungi to mammalian cells. We have worked on enabling products as varied as polymers, bacterial therapeutics, bulk protein production, novel antibiotics, fine chemicals, and more.
We have been able to work on a diversity of programs while consistently driving efficiencies in the Foundry with scale. We expect to accelerate growth in capacity by integrating new technologies across our existing footprint, building new Foundry space, and investing in software, automation and data to increase utilization.
Leverage our proof points to grow within all industries
We have now established proof points of success in a diverse set of end markets, in several cases far exceeding our customers’ specifications. When engaging with existing customers or potential new customers in similar or adjacent industry verticals, we can point to these case studies of success to demonstrate the value of our platform. This reduces the barriers to adoption, helps us grow our customer base, and increases the number of new programs under contract. Importantly, the reusable Codebase we generate from these new programs enables us to stay ahead of vertically focused competitors.
Grow with existing customers
Once we establish a relationship with a customer, there is significant room to expand the scope of our program engagements. We are able to grow with our customers and/or expand into other existing pockets of R&D spending. We have seen customers expand from one early program to five or ten programs a few years later and each new logo we add has the potential to become a true platform partner.
When we work with companies from their inception (or at least from the inception of their biotech investments), we enable them to avoid significant fixed cost investments and benefit from our economies of scale. Our relationship with these customers is extremely strong, as we are the core technology powering their R&D efforts. As a result, when these customers scale, their usage of our platform typically scales commensurately. For companies with existing, established biological capabilities, as we demonstrate the value of our flexible platform, we are able to grow our relationships to complement their core capabilities and increase the probability of success.

Reduce barriers to adoption by integrating with external R&D teams
It can be easy to fall into the trap of assuming that new disruptive technologies must subsume existing ways of working. When hosted servers and SaaS started rising in prominence, corporate IT teams had to wrestle with changing integrations and demands. Some information technology departments were resistant to moving “off-prem” because they felt they were effectively outsourcing their jobs. In response, the leaders in this field, such as Dell, would sometimes hire their customers’ information technology departments and find them jobs within Dell simply to get past this internal resistance. The reality was that these technologies were ushering in a much more substantial era for information technology, which dramatically increased the demand for this type of talent. This centralization of the model (from every company having large information technology departments building customized code to a broader array of specialized software vendors) didn’t come at the expense of information technology and digital technologies, but enabled its flourishing across all industries. We see something similar happening in biotechnology today. Internal R&D teams are typically both very excited to learn about the power of our platform but are also understandably nervous about what “outsourcing” work to Ginkgo might mean for the future of their teams. We have the opportunity to help them see the benefit in a true partnership with Ginkgo.
The vast majority of programs being run on the platform today are being run and managed by Ginkgo program teams—in-house scientists and engineers who are managing the R&D project to meet a customer’s specifications. Over time, we would like to build in enough standardized interfaces that a distributed network of scientists could access the platform directly through a well-defined integration and self-service layer. This transition will allow our program teams to devote more of their efforts to developing Codebase assets, enabling more rapid scaling, and reducing the barriers to adoption by our customers. There are significant technical hurdles for us to overcome in developing this technology, but it is on our near-term roadmap and we are constantly thinking about how to “productize” individual workflows on the platform. As an example, we are developing CDKs that standardize common cell engineering workflows and assets, capturing best practices that we’ve identified.


Build an ecosystem
As described above in “—Our Platform,” we believe we are building the industry standard developer platform for cell programming. In much the same way that early computing platforms and operating systems built real communities around their platforms in the 80s and 90s, we intend to build a community of developers building on the Ginkgo platform. As we invest to expand this ecosystem of services for cell programmers building on the Ginkgo platform, our value proposition to cell programmers increases and we become more ubiquitous.
Our People & Culture
A company is made of people. We have sought to bring together a diverse and multidisciplinary group of people who share our mission to make biology easier to engineer. Today, our extensive cross-functional team is collaborating to build our ecosystem, from organism designers to automation engineers, software developers to people operations, business development to facilities management, finance to molecular biology.
A culture built on care
We’ve strived to grow a culture based on care. As engineers, it is easy to fall into the trap of thinking of ourselves simply as tool builders. Tools can be used in many different ways, both good and bad, and engineers often discuss their tools as value neutral. But tools reflect the social beliefs and biases of the people who make them: today this is becoming increasingly apparent, with more and more evidence of algorithmic bias being built into AI systems, facial recognition, and much more.
As designers of the largest horizontal platform for cell programming, we are keenly aware of the need to care about how our platform is used. More significant than the impacts we have seen from digital platforms on our social world, biology is our health, our bodies, our food, and our environment. As we build the tools for programming biology, we must also care how those tools are used, and ensure that the risks and benefits are transparently and equitably shared.
A diverse, world-class team
As of December 31, 2022 we had 1,292 employees. Building a horizontal platform for cell engineering and a biosecurity and public health unit requires collaboration between diverse skills and functions. It also requires deep technical expertise. Our employees are dedicated to the following functions:
●Platform functions including organism engineering, design, DNA synthesis and assembly, genome engineering, protein engineering and characterization, transformation and transfection, next generation sequencing, assay development, ultra high throughput screening, analytical chemistry, synthetic chemistry, directed evolution, and fermentation. 
 ●Platform infrastructure functions including automation, software, development operations (“DevOps”), product management, data engineering, data analysis, and data science. 
 ●Deployment functions including upstream and downstream process engineering, project engineering, quality assurance and quality control. 
 ●Commercial functions including marketing, business development, alliance management, and corporate development. 
 ●Operational functions including bioinformatics, lab network management, delivery logistics and customer support. 
 ●Shared enabling functions including legal, people, operations, finance, information technology, information security, facilities, environmental health and safety, procurement, shipping and receiving, inventory management, laboratory operations, media preparation, and transformations.
 
In addition to our employees, our success would not be possible without the collaboration and support of the broad network of partners, contractors, contingent workers and temporary staff who make up the Ginkgo team.
Technologies reflect the values of the people who build them. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion are valuable and necessary in their own right, but we believe that it is essential to build a diverse team where people from different backgrounds are included and empowered to speak up and shape the growth of this technology. We are committed to growing a diverse team and continuing to empower an inclusive culture with strong employee ownership and engagement.
The full breadth of Ginkgo’s diversity and inclusion cannot be captured in demographic statistics, just as demographic categories cannot capture the full spectrum of diversity of human experience; however, we collect and report these numbers

for transparency and as a lagging indicator of our efforts. As of December 31, 2022, 44% of our U.S. employees self-identify as an underrepresented gender (not cis male) and 15% self-identify as coming from an underrepresented racial or ethnic group in science and engineering (Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, American Indian or Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander). We are not yet satisfied with these numbers and all teams have objectives around increasing diversity and building a culture of inclusion to ensure that diverse perspectives thrive.
Laying the groundwork for strong employee engagement in the future
As a founder-led company we have been able to infuse the organization with long-term strategic thinking from the start. The long-term engagement and mentality of our employees can be seen in our turnover: voluntary attrition is well below the industry average.

The individuals who work at Ginkgo and build our platform care deeply about how that platform is used and the impact our company will have in the world. We hope to maintain the long-term mentality we have benefited from as a founder-led public company. We believe a workforce with strong equity ownership will make the wise decisions needed to build long-term value for our company and build a company whose long-term impacts make them proud. That is why we have implemented a multi-class stock structure that permits all employees (current and future), not just founders, to hold high-vote (10 votes per share) common stock. We believe that our multi-class stock structure will help maintain this long-term mentality and encourage long-term equity ownership by our employees, thereby resulting in increasing employee ownership over time. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Ginkgo’s Business—Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure and Governance—Only our employees and directors are entitled to hold shares of Class B common stock (including shares of Class B common stock granted or otherwise issued to our employees and directors in the future), which shares have ten votes per share. This limits or precludes other stockholders’ ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, the approval of certain employee compensation plans, the adoption of certain amendments to our organizational documents and the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval.”
Competition
To our knowledge, there are currently no other companies that serve all industries covered by our horizontal cell programming platform. The solutions and applications offered by potential competitors vary in size, breadth, and scope, and given our broad set of application areas, we could face competition in many different forms. We face competition from customers’ internal R&D departments and other research solution providers that largely conduct genetic engineering by-hand. We also compete against companies that seek to utilize synthetic biology technologies to develop specific products or target certain end markets. Additionally, competing platforms may emerge from various sources, including from joint ventures and partnerships between well-capitalized technology and life sciences companies. We identify the following three groups as our principal set of competitors:
The Status Quo: “on prem” cell programming efforts
The main source of competition we encounter is from potential customers choosing to build or maintain in-house cell engineering teams and capabilities. This status quo includes building out laboratory space and then hiring a team of highly trained scientists to conduct research, largely “by-hand” and with limited scale efficiencies. Some internal R&D operations maintain a full suite of capabilities and can design, build and test relatively complex pathways while others may have certain internal capabilities and need to outsource other elements to CROs. We believe this is far less efficient for the customer and likely to yield worse outcomes as customers get fewer shots on goal for a given program budget.
That said, it can still be very difficult for companies to choose to trust Ginkgo with their R&D efforts versus building more traditional “on prem” labs. Smaller companies may feel like they’re “betting the farm” on Ginkgo, while larger companies may be sensitive to displacing existing R&D teams. As such, a key focus area for us is reducing the barriers to adoption for the platform by de-risking the upfront investment for earlier-stage companies and by helping larger companies integrate their scientists closely into our workflows and empower their scientists to manage requests directly so we feel more like a resource and partner than a fully outsourced provider. Investing in these areas is a key focus area for us going forward.
Examples of traditional “synthetic biology” companies that have been vertically integrated from their founding with a focus on building products using synthetic biology include Amyris, Inc. (“Amyris”), Genomatica, Novozymes, DuPont, and DSM. Additionally, the vast majority of therapeutics companies that are leveraging genetic engineering have in-house capabilities, including Biogen, Novo Nordisk, Vertex, Regeneron, Bayer, and many others. These companies may be viewed as

competitors to Ginkgo because they are creating products, using cell programming, that may compete with the products Ginkgo is enabling for our customers. However, as a horizontal platform, we view these companies not as competitors but as potential customers and focus not on “beating” them but rather on demonstrating our value proposition.
Verticalized cell engineering platforms
Within certain end markets, Ginkgo may compete against vertically-focused biotechnology companies providing cell engineering R&D capabilities to customers within a narrow set of end markets. While we believe the siloed nature of these companies limits their long-term potential, in the near-term, we may have a harder time penetrating those end markets given the incumbent vertical specialists in that space. The vast majority of these companies exist within therapeutic end markets given the history of cell engineering in that field. In theory, the expertise and learnings they develop from work in one field could be leveraged into neighboring end markets if these companies decided to adopt (and invest in) a more horizontal strategy. Examples of these vertically-focused platforms include AbCellera (antibody discovery), Codexis (enzymes), Senti Bio (cell therapy for oncology applications) and WuXi biologics (therapeutics).
 Other possible entrants
We may also face competition from new entrants in the market, including well-capitalized technology companies with possible strategic interests in synthetic biology and its capabilities. Such companies may emerge as competitors given their access to capital, capacity to create multi-disciplinary teams across biology, chemistry, computer science and engineering, and flexibility to enter strategic ventures with life sciences companies.
Intellectual Property
Overview: Foundry and Codebase
As discussed above, Ginkgo’s two core platform assets include:
●Ginkgo’s Foundry, which enables high-throughput cell programming; and 
 ●Ginkgo’s Codebase, which includes reusable biological assets that can be used to accelerate cell programs.
 
Ginkgo protects each of these core assets—the Foundry and the Codebase—through a combination of patents and trade secret protections.
Patents
Our general policy has been to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our offerings. Many of our collaboration agreements also provide a limited exclusive patent license to our collaboration partners relating to new technology developed in the collaboration. We typically retain the right to outlicense patents developed in connection with collaborations to third parties outside the scope of the exclusive license granted to our collaboration partner.
 Our worldwide patent portfolio includes patents acquired in transactions over time, including, most significantly, our acquisitions of Gen9 in 2017; Novogy in 2020; and Bayer Biologics and Zymergen in October 2022. Because these acquisitions more than doubled the size of our patent portfolio, and because the strategic priorities of the companies we acquired often differed from Ginkgo’s priorities, we may decide that it is in our interest to abandon, sell, or otherwise dispose of certain patents or patent applications from these acquisitions or that we determine are no longer relevant to our business.
 Patents generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary. No single patent or patent family is essential to Ginkgo as a whole or to any of Ginkgo’s subsidiaries. In addition to developing our patent portfolio, we license patents from third parties.
 We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent that we believe that it would be beneficial and cost-effective. We cannot provide any assurance that any of our current or future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents. We also cannot assure the scope of any of our future issued patents or warrant that any of our patents will prevent others from commercializing infringing products or technology.

Trade secrets
Ginkgo’s technology-related intellectual property that is not patent-protected is maintained as trade secrets. We employ a variety of safeguards to protect our information and trade secrets, including contractual arrangements with our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisors that impose obligations of confidentiality, assignment of inventions, and security; digital security measures; and physical security precautions.
We require confidentiality and material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials, and we also incorporate confidentiality and material transfer precautions into our collaboration agreements. For example, in the course of a cell program, we might transfer samples of intermediate strains to the customer for testing and scale-up work and then transfer a final commercial strain upon completion of our work. To protect both intermediate and final strains, we use strain transfer agreements that document the contractual restrictions and controls we have put into place, typically including, in the case of intermediate strains, covenants requiring the customer to return or destroy all strain samples after testing.
Trademarks and domain names
Although our business is directed at sophisticated corporate customers rather than end consumers, we have trademark rights and registrations in our name, logo, and other brand indicia in the United States and other jurisdictions around the world. We also have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.ginkgobioworks.com.
Intellectual property transaction structure
We earn revenue from collaboration agreements with customers under which we perform cell programming activities. Through our cell programs, we develop cells that produce or are products for our customers, which they market in their verticals.

With respect to intellectual property, we have relatively standard transaction structures that apply to cell programs for a customer. In this situation, our collaboration agreements typically provide that Ginkgo will own all collaboration-related intellectual property (“Foreground IP”) concerning cell programming. To protect our collaboration partners’ investment in the collaboration and to provide them with a competitive advantage from working with Ginkgo, Ginkgo provides a limited exclusive license to patents within the Foreground IP that cover the product, usually within a specified field. However, our terms may vary.
We typically do not provide exclusive licenses to unpatented Foreground IP (i.e., trade secrets and other know-how) that results from a collaboration. In our typical deal structure, we also do not provide exclusive licenses to our “background” intellectual property—i.e., the intellectual property, whether patented or unpatented, that we developed before entering into a collaboration or develop independently from our work in the collaboration. We believe that our transaction structures allow us to maximize the reuse of Codebase across programs and ensure that technology we develop does not lie fallow.
In-License Agreements 
In addition to our proprietary methods and technologies, we also non-exclusively in-license certain intellectual property assets from third parties.
 
Amyris Partnership Agreement
 On October 20, 2017, we entered into a partnership agreement (the “Partnership Agreement”) with Amyris, which, as amended from time to time, terminated all prior agreements between Ginkgo and Amyris. In the Partnership Agreement, Amyris, among other things, granted us a non-exclusive license effective as of June 28, 2016 (the date of an earlier agreement between the parties) under all of Amyris’s rights in and to certain specified microbial strains, and under all patents and applications associated with such microbial strains, to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell and import any products other than farnesene and/or farnesene derivatives that are chemically produced from farnesene. The license is subject to any previous exclusive licenses provided to third parties and is royalty-free, fully paid-up, sublicensable, non-exclusive and perpetual (i.e., it survives termination or expiration of the Partnership Agreement except in the case of our insolvency).
Strateos Collaboration Agreement
 On October 2, 2017, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Strateos, Inc. f/k/a Transcriptic, Inc. (“Strateos”), which was amended and restated on April 20, 2021 (the “Strateos Collaboration Agreement”). Under the Strateos Collaboration Agreement, Strateos granted us a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty-free license under certain intellectual property rights to use its software platform in a range of activities relating to our business, including, among other things, developing and commercializing cell lines, developing data packages, providing foundry and analytical services and performing diagnostic testing. The Strateos Collaboration Agreement expired in 2022 and we retain a license to use Strateos’ software.
Suppliers
Ginkgo’s suppliers for cell programming operations comprise primarily manufacturers and distributors of life science tools, consumables and equipment as well as certain specific providers of contract research, development and manufacturing services. We will sometimes enter into long-term, strategic partnerships with innovative suppliers. Because of the significant scale of our Foundry’s operations, we believe we are often an early adopter and the largest customer at scale of certain new life science tools and technologies. Our supply agreements with Twist Bioscience Corporation (“Twist”), as further described below, are examples of such strategic supplier relationships. We will also occasionally acquire technology or Codebase assets for strategic reasons and because we can integrate the technology effectively into our platform — Zymergen, Altar, and Circularis are recent examples.
Our suppliers for Concentric by Ginkgo include multiple manufacturers and distributors of LFA test kits and COVID-19 sample collection kits. We have developed a national network of third party labs for provision of COVID-19 molecular testing services. We also utilize third parties for certain other services, including physician authorizations and on-site test administration, in the provision of our end-to-end COVID-19 testing offering.
Our software, automation, data, information technology, DevOps and information security functions utilize various third party software and information technology service providers, including AWS, for data storage and processing. We also routinely engage a variety of third parties for professional services, contract employment services and consulting services.
Twist
In April 2022, we entered into a non-cancelable supply agreement (the “2022 Agreement”) with Twist, which requires us to purchase synthetic DNA at specified volumes on an annual basis over a four-year term. To the extent we fail to meet our annual minimum purchase obligations, we are required to pay a fee per unit of shortfall. The products we may purchase that contribute toward achieving our annual minimum purchase obligation can vary based on our discretion, subject to advance notice provided to Twist.
Our annual minimum purchase obligation may be adjusted for the following reasons: (i) the unavailability of certain products for purchase in a given quarter; (ii) the unavailability of certain features; (iii) delays in shipments; and (iv) lack of performance. We receive volume discounts on purchases based on specified volume thresholds over the term of the 2022 Agreement.

The 2022 Agreement can only be terminated (i) upon mutual agreement of both parties, (ii) by us upon a specified change of control, (iii) upon a material breach of the contract by either party, or (iv) by Twist in the event that we fail to place orders for more than a certain percentage of our required annual minimums under the 2022 Agreement. The purchase minimums in the 2022 Agreement create an enforceable obligation only in conjunction with each purchase order.
Government Contracts
We have entered into agreements with governmental entities and contractors in the past to serve as a U.S. government contractor or subcontractor and may do so again in the future. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Governmental Regulation and Litigation—We have pursued in the past and may pursue additional U.S. Government contracting and subcontracting opportunities in the future and as a U.S. Government prime contractor and subcontractor, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations.”
Government Regulations
Our business, or the business of our customers, may be regulated by the FDA and other federal authorities in the United States, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA"), DEA and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), as well as comparable authorities in foreign jurisdictions and various state and local authorities in the United States. Failure to comply with applicable regulations may result in enforcement actions, civil or criminal sanctions, and adverse publicity.
FDA regulation
We provide cell engineering and product discovery services to customers engaged in the manufacture of foods, cosmetics and pharmaceutical products. The FDA regulates the research, development, testing, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, storage, recordkeeping, premarket review, approval or licensure, processing, formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing, distribution, sale, post-market monitoring and reporting of our customers’ pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and food products, and the FTC also regulates the advertising and promotion of these products.
We also act as a systems integrator and authorized distributor of certain COVID-19 diagnostic test and collection kits manufactured by independent third parties, and we work with laboratory partners that provide clinical laboratory testing services as part of the COVID-19 testing services we offer, and these tests and test kits may be subject to regulation by the FDA. In particular, the tests and test kits used in our COVID-19 testing services may be subject to regulation by the FDA as medical devices, and may be required to comply with the requirement that such products have obtained clearance, approval, or other marketing authorizations, such as an Emergency Use Authorization ("EUA"), before they can be commercialized, as well as post-market requirements such as adverse event reporting and restrictions on labeling, marketing, and distribution.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") and FDA issued several policy statements in November 2021 governing the regulation of COVID-19 Laboratory Developed Tests (“LDTs”) that resume FDA premarket review of COVID-19 LDTs that HHS halted in August 2020. Pursuant to these new policy statements, FDA expects laboratories to seek FDA marketing authorization and otherwise comply with FDA device regulations when marketing COVID-19 LDTs. An LDT is an in vitro diagnostic test that is intended for clinical use and is designed, manufactured, and used within a single laboratory. LDTs are classified as medical devices, but the FDA has historically exercised enforcement discretion and has generally not enforced FDA requirements, including premarket review, with respect to laboratories that offer LDTs. While HHS and FDA have announced their intention to require premarket review of COVID-19 LDTs, either agency may change its position in the future.
Medical products, including COVID-19 tests, that are granted an EUA or other marketing authorization must comply fully with the terms and conditions provided in the EUA or other marketing authorization. For example, EUAs for COVID-19 tests may include conditions of authorization applicable to the EUA holder, authorized distributors and authorized laboratories. Noncompliance with applicable requirements could result in negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters or untitled letters from the FDA, mandated corrective promotional materials, advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. The FDA can also withdraw marketing authorization for the applicable product, and in the case of a product subject to an EUA, the authorization to market the product under the EUA lasts only as long as the declared public health emergency.
DEA regulation
We are engaged in the research, development, and export of certain products that may be regulated as controlled substances, including microbes designed to generate precursors to cannabinoids or other chemical intermediates. The Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended from time to time, establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA is concerned with the control of handlers of controlled substances, and with the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce. The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use, and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. Schedule I substances are considered to present the highest risk of abuse, and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among controlled substances. Marijuana is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. However, the term does not include “hemp,” which means the cannabis plant and any part of that plant, including the seeds and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 THC concentration of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis.

Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, business activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which controlled substance schedule is authorized for that activity.
The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration. The DEA requires “effective controls and procedures” to guard against theft and diversion of controlled substances. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule (with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances), type of business activity conducted, quantity of substances handled, and a variety of other factors. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory. While the specific means by which effective controls and procedures are achieved may vary, security practices may include use of cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances, and, in certain scenarios, periodic reports made to the DEA. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance, and disposal of controlled substances must adhere to various methods authorized by the regulations. In addition, special authorization and notification requirements apply to imports and exports.
Failure by registered establishments to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in enforcement action. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could eventuate in criminal proceedings. Individual states also regulate controlled substances.
Laboratory Licensing and Certification Requirements
The clinical laboratories we partner with for our COVID-19 testing program are subject to federal oversight under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment of 1988 ("CLIA"), which requires all clinical laboratories to meet certain quality assurance, quality control and personnel standards. Laboratories also must undergo proficiency testing and are subject to inspections. Standards for testing under CLIA are based on the complexity of the tests performed by the laboratory, with tests classified as “high complexity,” “moderate complexity,” or “waived.” Laboratories performing high complexity testing are required to meet more stringent requirements than moderate complexity laboratories. Certain of our partner laboratories must undergo on-site surveys at least every two years, which may be conducted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) under the CLIA program or by a private CMS-approved accrediting agency. In addition, we hold CLIA Certificates of Waiver and may perform certain CLIA-waived tests on behalf of our clients, which subjects us to certain CLIA requirements. The sanction for failure to comply with CLIA requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory’s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and criminal penalties.
The operations of our partner laboratories and our laboratories holding CLIA Certificates of Waiver are also subject to state and local laboratory regulation. CLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations different from or more stringent than those under federal law, and a number of states have implemented their own laboratory regulatory requirements. State laws may require that laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls, or require maintenance of certain records. No assurances can be given that we or our partner laboratories will pass all future licensure or certification inspections.
Our facilities and laboratories hold local, state and federal permits, licenses and registrations necessary for compliance in specific work and operations, including from the Massachusetts Water Resource Authority, Boston Fire Department, Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection, Boston Public Health Commission, Cambridge Biosafety Committee, Massachusetts Department of Public Health, USDA and DEA.
 Federal Select Agent Regulations
Our research facilities that synthesize DNA sequences or perform other activities could become subject to the FSAP, which involves rules administered by the CDC and the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”). The FSAP regulates the possession, use, and transfer of biological select agents and toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to public health, animal or plant health, or animal or plant products. FSAP regulatory requirements include: (i) registration with the CDC and/or APHIS for research facilities that deal with the select agents and toxins; (ii) submission to periodic biosafety and security inspections; and (iii) reporting of theft, loss or release of select agents. Federal agency enforcement actions for violations of FSAP regulations can include the initiation of corrective actions, complete or partial suspension or revocation of select agent registrations or civil or criminal liability.
Genetically Modified Materials Regulations
Our technologies and the technologies of our customers involve the use of genetically modified cells, organisms and biomaterials, including, without limitation, GMOs and genetically modified microorganisms ("GMMs"), and their respective products. In the United States, the FDA, the USDA through its APHIS, and the EPA are the primary agencies that regulate the use of GMOs, GMMs and potential products derived from GMOs or GMMs or Genetically Modified Materials, pursuant to the Coordinated Framework for the Regulation of Biotechnology.
The FDA reviews the safety of food consumed by humans and of feed consumed by animals under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). Under the FDCA, food and feed manufacturers are responsible for ensuring that the products they market, including those developed through genetic engineering, are safe and properly labeled. In addition, the FDA must approve the use of any food additives, including GMOs, before marketing.
USDA's APHIS examines whether a plant itself presents a “plant pest” risk under the Plant Protection Act (“PPA”). Specifically, APHIS is responsible for regulating the introduction (i.e., importation, interstate movement or release into the environment) of certain GMOs and plants under the plant pest provisions in the PPA to ensure that they do not pose a plant pest risk. APHIS finalized changes to the PPA’s implementing regulations with respect to certain GMOs in May 2020. A person or organization may request a regulatory status review from APHIS to determine whether a GMO is unlikely to pose a plant pest risk and, therefore, is not regulated under the plant pest provisions of the PPA or the regulations codified at 7 C.F.R. Part 340; requesting a regulatory status review tends to assume the GMO at issue does not otherwise fall within a regulatory exemption. If the GMO does not qualify for an exemption or if the APHIS regulatory status review process finds that the plant poses a plausible plant pest risk, then the GMO may require an APHIS permit, i.e., be a regulated article under Part 340. A regulated article may be subject to APHIS for the environmental release, importation, or interstate movement of the GMO or its progeny.

EPA regulates, under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”), the pesticides (including plant incorporated protectants) that are used with crops, including GMO herbicide-tolerant crops. FIFRA generally requires all pesticides to be registered before distribution or sale, unless they are exempted. Under FIFRA, a pesticide registrant must demonstrate that the pesticide at issue, when used pursuant to its specifications, “will not generally cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment” to secure a registration. EPA must approve each distinct pesticide product, each distinct use pattern, and each distinct use site. In addition to EPA’s FIFRA authority, EPA also regulates potential human health impacts from pesticides under the FDCA. EPA does so by establishing “tolerance levels” (i.e., “the amount of pesticide that may remain on food products”) under the FDCA.

Certain genetically modified microorganisms that are not otherwise regulated under FIFRA and FDCA may be subject to EPA regulation under the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”). New microorganisms that are formed by combining genetic material from organisms in different genera (known as intergeneric microorganisms) may be subject to reporting requirements prior to production or distribution in commerce (Microbial Activity Commercial Activity Notice), or use in research and development (TSCA Experimental Release Application), unless the entity can meet all required criteria to obtain an exemption under TSCA.
 Telehealth regulation
Our telehealth provider partner is subject to various federal, state and local certification and licensing laws, regulations and approvals, relating to, among other things, the adequacy of health care, the practice of medicine and other health professions (including the provision of remote care and cross-coverage practice), equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures and the prerequisites for ordering laboratory tests. Some states have enacted regulations specific to providing services to patients via telehealth. Such regulations include, among other things, informed consent requirements that some states require providers to obtain from their patients before providing telehealth services. Health professionals who provide professional services using telehealth modalities must, in most instances, hold a valid license to practice the applicable health profession in the state in which the patient is located. In addition, certain states require a physician providing telehealth to be physically located in the same state as the patient. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties against telehealth providers.
State corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting laws
Our relationship with our telehealth provider partner, who provides physician oversight and support to individuals seeking COVID-19 diagnostic or screening testing, including evaluating each request for testing, communicating and providing consultation services for certain test results, is subject to various state laws, which are intended to prevent unlicensed persons

from interfering with or influencing a physician’s professional judgment, and prohibiting the sharing of professional services income with non-professional or business interests. These laws vary from state to state and are subject to broad interpretation and enforcement by state regulators. A determination of non-compliance could lead to adverse judicial or administrative action against us and/or our telehealth provider partner, civil or criminal penalties, receipt of cease and desist orders from state regulators, loss of provider licenses, or a restructuring of our arrangement with our telehealth provider partner.
Healthcare fraud and abuse laws
Although none of our COVID-testing offerings are currently billed to any third-party payor, including any commercial payor or government healthcare program, by us or any of our laboratory or telehealth provider partners, we may nonetheless be subject to a number of federal and state healthcare regulatory laws that restrict business practices in the healthcare industry. These laws include, but are not limited to, federal and state anti-kickback, false claims, and other healthcare fraud and abuse laws.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.

The federal physician self-referral prohibition, commonly known as the Stark Law, prohibits a physician, in the absence of an applicable exception, from making a referral for certain designated health services covered by the Medicare or Medicaid program, including clinical laboratory services, if the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has a financial relationship with the entity providing the designated health services. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity furnishing the designated health services from billing, presenting or causing to be presented a claim for the designated health services furnished pursuant to the prohibited referral.
The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws prohibit, among other things, any individual or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or the Stark Law, constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act.
In addition to the Anti-Kickback Statute and the Stark Law, the United States recently enacted a law known as the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act ("EKRA"), which created a new federal crime for knowingly and willfully: (i) soliciting or receiving any remuneration in return for referring a patient to a recovery home, clinical treatment facility, or laboratory; or (ii) paying or offering any remuneration to induce such a referral or in exchange for an individual using the services of a recovery home, clinical treatment facility, or laboratory. Unlike the Anti-Kickback Statute, EKRA is not limited to services reimbursable under a government health care program, but instead extends to all services reimbursed by “health care benefit programs.”
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations, as amended ("HIPAA") created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Similar state and local laws and regulations may also restrict business practices in the medical device and clinical laboratory industries, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by patients themselves; and state laws that require companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources.

Violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties including damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
Federal and state data privacy and security regulations
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of personal information, including health-related information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws, including HIPAA, and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. HIPAA, and its respective implementing regulations, imposes obligations on “covered entities,” including certain health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses, and their respective “business associates” that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, as well as their covered subcontractors with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may result in civil and criminal penalties. HHS is required to conduct periodic compliance audits of covered entities and their business associates. HIPAA also authorizes state attorneys general to bring civil actions seeking either an injunction or damages in response to violations of HIPAA privacy and security regulations.
In addition, certain state laws, such as the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, the CCPA and the CPRA govern the privacy and security of personal information, including health-related information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other (thus complicating compliance efforts), and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
