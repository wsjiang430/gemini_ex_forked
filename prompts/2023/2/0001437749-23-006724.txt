ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
 
History
 
BBX Capital, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company” or, unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a Florida-based diversified holding company. BBX Capital, Inc. as a standalone entity without its subsidiaries is referred to as “BBX Capital.”
 
Spin-Off from Bluegreen Vacations
 
Prior to September 30, 2020, the Company was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bluegreen Vacations Holding Corporation (“Bluegreen Vacations”) (formerly known as BBX Capital Corporation), whose principal holdings were Bluegreen Vacations Corporation (“Bluegreen”), BBX Capital Real Estate LLC (“BBX Capital Real Estate” or “BBXRE”), BBX Sweet Holdings, LLC (“BBX Sweet Holdings” or "BBXSH"), and Renin Holdings, LLC (“Renin”). On September 30, 2020, Bluegreen Vacations completed a spin-off which separated Bluegreen Vacations’ business, activities, and investments into two separate, publicly-traded companies: (i) Bluegreen Vacations, which continues to hold its investment in Bluegreen, and (ii) BBX Capital, which continues to hold all of Bluegreen Vacations’ other businesses and investments, including BBX Capital Real Estate, BBX Sweet Holdings, which currently owns over 90% of IT’SUGAR, LLC (“IT’SUGAR”), and Renin. The spin-off was consummated on September 30, 2020 with the distribution by Bluegreen Vacations to its shareholders of all of the outstanding shares of BBX Capital’s Common Stock through the distribution of one share of BBX Capital’s Class A Common Stock for each share of its Class A Common Stock and one share of BBX Capital’s Class B Common Stock for each share of its Class B Common Stock. Accordingly, following the spin-off, Bluegreen Vacations ceased to have an ownership interest in the Company, and Bluegreen Vacations’ shareholders who received shares of BBX Capital’s Common Stock in the distribution became shareholders of the Company.
 
In connection with the spin-off, BBX Capital was converted from a Florida limited liability company into a Florida corporation and changed its name from BBX Capital Florida LLC to BBX Capital, Inc. In addition, in connection with the spin-off, Bluegreen Vacations issued a $75.0 million note payable to the Company that accrues interest at a rate of 6% per annum and requires payments of interest on a quarterly basis. Under the terms of the note, Bluegreen Vacations has the option in its discretion to defer interest payments under the note, with interest on the entire outstanding balance thereafter to accrue at a cumulative, compounded rate of 8% per annum until such time as Bluegreen Vacations is current on all accrued payments under the note, including deferred interest. All outstanding amounts under the note will become due and payable on September 30, 2025 or earlier upon certain other events. Bluegreen Vacations is permitted to prepay the note in whole or in part at any time. In December 2021, Bluegreen Vacations prepaid $25.0 million of the principal balance of the note, reducing the outstanding balance to $50.0 million.
 
In October 2020, BBX Capital’s Class A Common Stock commenced trading on the OTCQX Best Market under the ticker symbol “BBXIA,” and its Class B Common Stock commenced trading on the OTC Pink Market under the ticker symbol “BBXIB.”
 
Our Objectives
 
The Company’s goal is to build long-term shareholder value. Since many of the Company’s assets do not generate income on a regular or predictable basis, the Company’s objective is long-term growth as measured by increases in book value and intrinsic value over time. The Company regularly reviews the performance of its investments and, based upon economic, market, and other relevant factors, considers transactions involving the sale or disposition of all or a portion of its assets, investments, or subsidiaries. Further, subject to market conditions and other factors, the Company has and may from time to time in the future repurchase its outstanding common stock.

BBX Capital Real Estate 
 
Business Overview
 
BBX Capital Real Estate is engaged in the acquisition, development, construction, ownership, financing, and management of real estate and investments in real estate joint ventures, including investments in multifamily rental apartment communities, single-family master-planned for sale housing communities, and commercial properties located primarily in Florida. Since November 2018, BBX Capital Real Estate has owned a 50% equity interest in the Altman Companies, a developer and manager of multifamily rental apartment communities, and in January 2023, BBX Capital Real Estate acquired the remaining equity interests in the Altman Companies. In addition, BBXRE manages the legacy assets acquired in connection with the Company’s sale of BankAtlantic in 2012, including portfolios of loans receivable, real estate properties, and judgments against past borrowers.
 
In an effort to diversify its portfolio of real estate developments, BBXRE is also currently pursuing investment opportunities in the development of warehouse and logistics facilities and has expanded its operating platform to include a logistics real estate division. Further, as market conditions permit, the Altman Companies may also evaluate potential opportunities to develop multifamily apartment communities in new geographical areas, as well as multifamily apartment communities that include affordable housing.
 
Strategy
 
BBX Capital Real Estate’s strategy is focused on:
 

● | Identifying, acquiring, and developing real estate, including multifamily rental apartment communities, single-family master-planned for sale housing communities, and infill speculative and build-to-suit warehouse and logistics facilities; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Identifying and investing in real estate joint ventures with third party developers. 

 
    2 

  

Although BBXRE historically focused on the monetization of the legacy asset portfolio formerly held by BankAtlantic through the collection or sale of loans receivable and the development or sale of foreclosed real estate properties, the monetization of the portfolio has been largely completed. As a result, BBXRE’s long-term goal is to build a diversified portfolio of profitable real estate investments that generate recurring earnings and cash flows primarily through the following activities:
 

● | Continuing to expand its investments in multifamily rental apartment communities through the Altman Companies. In addition to the development and sale of multifamily rental apartment communities through the Altman Companies, other investment opportunities may include the development of multifamily rental apartment communities that will be owned and held over a longer term investment period and the pursuit of investment opportunities in new geographic locations outside of Florida. Further, while BBXRE’s investments in joint ventures sponsored by the Altman Companies primarily involve investing in the managing member of the joint ventures, BBXRE has in the past and may in the future consider opportunistically making increased equity investments in projects.

Investments
 
BBX Capital Real Estate currently holds investments in a diverse portfolio of real estate developments, including multifamily rental apartment communities, single-family master-planned for sale communities, mixed-used properties, and other legacy assets. The following provides a description of certain of these investments.
Multifamily Rental Apartment Communities – The Altman Companies
 
As of December 31, 2022, BBX Capital Real Estate owned a 50% equity interest in the Altman Companies, a joint venture between BBXRE and Joel Altman engaged in the development, construction, and management of multifamily apartment communities, and as further described below, in January 2023, BBX Capital Real Estate acquired the remaining equity interests in the Altman Companies.
Business Overview
 
The Altman Companies is an integrated platform engaged in the development and sale of multifamily apartment communities. Since 1968, these companies and their predecessors have developed and managed more than 27,000 multifamily units throughout the United States, including communities in Florida, Michigan, Illinois, Tennessee, Georgia, Texas, and North Carolina. The Altman Companies currently operates through the following companies:

● | Altman Development Company (“ADC”) – The Altman Companies owns 100% of ADC, which performs site selection and other predevelopment activities (including project underwriting and design), identifies development financing (which is typically comprised of a combination of internal and external equity and institutional debt), provides oversight of the construction process, and arranges for the ultimate sale of the projects upon stabilization. ADC enters into a development agreement with each joint venture that is formed to invest in development projects originated by the platform and earns a development fee for its services.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Altman Management Company (“AMC”) – The Altman Companies currently owns 100% of AMC, which performs leasing and property management services for the multifamily apartment communities developed by the Altman Companies prior to the ultimate sale of such projects. In certain cases, AMC also provides such services to apartment communities owned by third parties and certain affiliated entities. AMC enters into a leasing and property management agreement with each joint venture that is formed to invest in projects originated by the platform and earns a management fee for its services. 
● | Altman-Glenewenkel Construction (“AGC”) – The Altman Companies currently owns 60% of AGC, which performs general contractor services for a majority of the multifamily apartment communities developed by the Altman Companies. For joint ventures formed to invest in projects originated by the platform for which a third-party general contractor is not used, AGC enters into a general contractor agreement with each joint venture and earns a general contractor fee for its services. 

 
Through January 31, 2023, BBXRE and Mr. Altman invested in the managing member of the joint ventures that were formed to invest in projects originated by the platform. The managing member is typically entitled to receive an increased percentage of the joint venture distributions from the projects to the extent that the equity investors in such ventures receive agreed-upon returns on their investments. However, as a result of BBXRE’s acquisition of Mr. Altman’s equity interests in the Altman Companies in January 2023, as further described below, Mr. Altman’s level of investment in the managing member will decrease, and other than certain projects currently in predevelopment, his investment in new developments will generally earn profits consistent with the non-managing members in the applicable development projects. Further, BBXRE has in the past and may in the future consider opportunistically making increased equity investments in one or more of such projects originated by the Altman Companies.
 
The Altman Companies has historically incurred operating costs in excess of the fees earned from the projects, and as a result, earnings generated by the overall platform are generally associated with BBXRE and Mr. Altman’s receipt of promoted equity distributions from their investments in the managing member of the development joint ventures.
 
BBXRE's Ownership in the Altman Companies and Acquisition of Additional Equity Interests
 
In November 2018, BBX Capital Real Estate acquired a 50% equity interest in the Altman Companies for cash consideration of $14.6 million, including $2.3 million in transaction costs, with Mr. Altman retaining a 50% equity interest. While the Altman Companies was a joint venture between BBXRE and Mr. Altman, the parties shared decision-making authority for all significant operating and financing decisions. To the extent that the parties could not reach consensus on a matter, the operating agreement generally provided that a third party would resolve such matter; however, for certain decisions, the operating agreement provided that the venture could not proceed with such matters without approval from both parties.
 
    3 

  

Pursuant to the operating agreement of the Altman Companies, BBXRE also agreed to acquire an additional 40% equity interest in the Altman Companies from Mr. Altman in January 2023 for a purchase price of $9.4 million, subject to certain adjustments (including reimbursements for predevelopment expenditures incurred at the time of the acquisition), at which time BBXRE would also acquire control and decision-making authority for all significant operating and financing decisions related to the Altman Companies as of and subsequent to the acquisition. Further, Mr. Altman also had the right, at his option or in other predefined circumstances, to require BBXRE to purchase his remaining 10% equity interest in the Altman Companies for $2.4 million, at which time Mr. Altman would no longer serve as an employee of the Altman Companies and no longer have an equity interest in the Altman Companies. However, irrespective of BBXRE’s acquisition of additional equity interests in the Altman Companies, Mr. Altman is entitled to retain his membership interests, including his decision-making rights, in the managing member of all development joint ventures that were originated prior to BBXRE’s acquisition of such equity interests in the Altman Companies from Mr. Altman.
 
On January 31, 2023 (the "Acquisition Date"), BBXRE closed on the acquisition of the additional 40% equity interests in the Altman Companies for $8.1 million, reflecting the base purchase price of $9.4 million, an additional $0.1 million of reimbursements for predevelopment expenditures incurred at the time of the acquisition, and a downward adjustment of $1.4 million to reflect an estimated working capital deficit calculated pursuant to the terms of the operating agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the operating agreement, the final working capital adjustment amount will be determined by BBXRE and Mr. Altman following the closing and may result in the payment of additional consideration to Mr. Altman or a refund to BBXRE.
 
In connection with the acquisition of the 40% interest from Mr. Altman, BBXRE also acquired the remaining 10% equity interest owned by Mr. Altman. Pursuant to the terms of the modified arrangement for the acquisition of the remaining 10% equity interest, the parties agreed that Mr. Altman will remain employed by the Altman Companies and that the remaining $2.4 million payment for the interest will be deferred until the earlier of (i) the termination of Mr. Altman’s employment from the Altman Companies or (ii) November 30, 2028 (the “Final Payment Date”). In addition, the parties agreed to the following terms related to new development projects commencing subsequent to the Acquisition Date:
 

● | With respect to certain proposed development projects in predevelopment, Mr. Altman will be entitled to invest in the managing member of any joint venture formed to invest in such projects as if his ownership percentage in the Altman Companies was still 10% if the projects commence prior to the Final Payment Date.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | With respect to certain proposed development projects that were determined to be unlikely to proceed and for which Mr. Altman did not receive reimbursement for his share of predevelopment expenditures at closing, BBXRE agreed to reimburse Mr. Altman for his share of predevelopment expenditures if such projects ultimately proceed at a later date prior to the Final Payment Date. Further, if the projects commence prior to the Final Payment Date, Mr. Altman will also be entitled to invest in the managing member of any joint venture formed to invest in such projects as if his ownership percentage in the Altman Companies was still 10%.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | With respect to all other projects that commence prior to the Final Payment Date, Mr. Altman will be required to invest in the managing member of any joint venture formed to invest in such projects as if his relative ownership percentage in the Altman Companies was 10%. However, in such case, his investment in the ventures will be entitled to profits similar to those earned by non-managing members rather than the profits to which BBXRE will be entitled as the managing member. If Mr. Altman does not invest in the managing member of additional joint ventures, BBXRE will be entitled to offset his required capital contribution against the deferred $2.4 million payable to Mr. Altman.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As a result of the transaction, BBXRE is now entitled to nominate all members of the executive committee responsible for the management of the Altman Companies (although BBXRE has continued to nominate Mr. Altman as a member of the committee) and is deemed to have acquired control and decision-making authority for all significant operating and financing decisions related to the Altman Companies. Further, BBXRE will have decision-making authority for all significant operating and financing decisions for any development joint venture that is sponsored and formed by the Altman Companies subsequent to the Acquisition Date. However, as discussed above, Mr. Altman has retained his membership interests, including his decision-making rights, in the managing member of all development joint ventures that were originated prior to BBXRE’s acquisition of the remaining equity interests in the Altman Companies from Mr. Altman. 
 
Accounting for BBXRE's Investment in the Altman Companies
 
Through the Acquisition Date, the Company accounted for its investment in the Altman Companies under the equity method of accounting, as BBXRE and Mr. Altman jointly managed the Altman Companies and shared decision-making authority for all significant operating and financing decisions through such date. Further, the Company has accounted for its investments in the managing member of development joint ventures that were originated prior to the Acquisition Date under the equity method of accounting, as BBXRE and Mr. Altman similarly shared decision-making authority for all significant operating and financing decisions related to the managing member of such joint ventures. 
 
As a result of BBXRE’s acquisition of control and decision-making authority over the Altman Companies, the Company will now consolidate the Altman Companies in its financial statements as of the Acquisition Date using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed associated with an acquiree be recognized at their fair values at the acquisition date. As a result, the Company will remeasure the carrying value of its current equity interests in the Altman Companies at fair value as of the Acquisition Date, with any resulting remeasurement adjustment recognized in the Company’s statement of operations. Further, the Company expects to recognize goodwill based on the difference between (i) the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the Altman Companies at the Acquisition Date and (ii) the aggregate of the consideration transferred (measured in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting) and the fair values of the Company’s current equity interest and any noncontrolling interests in the Altman Companies at the acquisition date.
 
As a result of the acquisition, the Company expects that it will also consolidate the managing member of any new development joint ventures that are sponsored and formed by the Altman Companies commencing as of and subsequent to the Acquisition Date. Further, while Joel Altman will generally retain his decision-making rights in the managing member of development joint ventures that were originated prior to the Acquisition Date, the Company is continuing to evaluate its accounting for its investments in such joint ventures as of and subsequent to the Acquisition Date under the applicable accounting guidance.

Other Matters Related to the Altman Companies
 
As of December 31, 2022, BBXRE and Mr. Altman had each contributed $4.8 million to ABBX Guaranty, LLC (“ABBX”), a joint venture established to provide guarantees on the indebtedness and construction cost overruns of development joint ventures formed by the Altman Companies. Under the terms of the operating agreement of ABBX, BBXRE and Mr. Altman will retain their respective 50% equity interests in the joint venture until such time that the joint venture is no longer providing guarantees related to development joint ventures originated prior to the Acquisition Date. At such time that ABBX is no longer providing guarantees related to such development joint ventures, BBXRE will generally acquire Mr. Altman’s equity interest in ABBX based on his then outstanding capital in ABBX.
 
In certain circumstances, the Altman Companies may acquire the 40% membership interests in AGC that are not owned by the Altman Companies for a purchase price based on formulas set forth in the operating agreement of AGC. Following the acquisition of Mr. Altman’s equity interests in the Altman Companies in January 2023, BBXRE currently expects that it will exercise its right to acquire the remaining 40% membership interests in AGC in 2023. Due to the formula applicable to the option pursuant to which BBXRE is permitted to acquire such interests, which is primarily calculated based on AGC’s working capital balance and a percentage of expected profits from current construction projects and is not calculated based on the fair value of such interests, BBXRE does not expect to pay a significant amount of cash upon the closing of the acquisition of such interests. However, BBXRE would assume responsibility for any working capital deficits related to AGC at the time of closing and may be obligated to pay a percentage of profits from AGC, if any, to the seller over time.
 
In March 2023, the Altman Companies amended and restated the operating agreement of AMC to admit an unaffiliated property management company as a joint venture partner. The Altman Companies is continuing to serve as the managing member of AMC, with any major decisions requiring the approval of both parties. Once the parties have received any necessary consents related to the formation of the joint ventures as required by various stakeholders, including certain lenders, equity investors, and regulatory agencies with jurisdiction, the unaffiliated property management company will serve as the managing member of AMC, with any major decisions continuing to require the approval of both parties. Under the terms of the operating agreement, the parties will each be entitled to receive distributions of available cash of the joint venture based on a proscribed formula within the operating agreement, with the parties generally each receiving 50% of distributable cash after the unaffiliated property management company has received its initial contribution to AMC and the parties have received a return of any additional capital contributions subsequent to the formation of the joint venture. Further, pursuant to the terms of the agreement, each party has the right to terminate the joint venture arrangement at any time, with such termination resulting in the unaffiliated property management company transferring its ownership interests in AMC back to the Altman Companies. However, if the Altman Companies exercises this right prior to the first anniversary of the formation of the joint venture, the Altman Companies is required to pay a penalty up to a maximum amount of $0.2 million.
 
Active Developments Sponsored by the Altman Companies
 
As of December 31, 2022, BBXRE had investments in eight active developments sponsored by the Altman Companies, which are as follows (dollars in thousands):
 

Project | Location | Apartment Units | | Project Status at December 31, 2022 | | Carrying Value of BBXRE Investment at December 31, 2022 | 
-----------------------------------+--------------------------+-----------------+-----+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+--
Altis Grand Central | Tampa, Florida | | 314 | | Stabilized - 94% Occupied | | $ | 687 
Altis Ludlam Trail (1) | Miami, Florida | | 312 | | Construction Completed - Currently Being Leased | | | 12,216
Altis Grand at Lake Willis Phase 1 | Orlando, Florida | | 329 | | Under Construction - Expected Completion in 2024 | | | 850 
Altis Lake Willis Phase 2 | Orlando, Florida | | 230 | | Under Construction - Expected Completion in 2024 | | | 601 
Altis Grand at Suncoast | Lutz, Florida | | 449 | | Under Construction - Expected Completion in 2024 | | | 4,579 
Altis Blue Lake | West Palm Beach, Florida | | 318 | | Under Construction - Expected Completion in 2024 | | | 647 
Altis Santa Barbara | Naples, Florida | | 242 | | Under Construction - Expected Completion in 2024 | | | 433 
Altra Kendall | Kendall, Florida | | 342 | | Under Construction - Expected Completion in 2024 | | | 5,670 


(1) | The carrying value of BBXRE’s investment at December 31, 2022 includes $11.6 million related to BBXRE’s investment in the preferred equity associated with the Altis Ludlam Trail project, including the investment balance and accrued preferred return.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rights to Joint Venture Distributions
 
The operating agreements governing the joint ventures sponsored by the Altman Companies generally provide that the holders of the non-managing membership interests are entitled to distributions based on their pro-rata share of the capital contributions to the ventures until such members receive their aggregate capital contributions plus a specified return on their capital. After such members receive such amounts, distributions are based on an agreed-upon allocation of the remaining amounts available for distribution, with the holders of the managing membership interests receiving an increasing percentage of the distributions. As BBXRE’s investments in the above joint ventures include investments as a managing member, BBXRE’s overall economic interest in the expected distributions from such ventures in many cases is not the same as its pro-rata share of its contributed capital in the ventures.
Single Family Development - Beacon Lake Master Planned Development
 
BBXRE is the master developer of the Beacon Lake Community, a master planned community located in St. Johns County, Florida that is being developed in four phases and expected to be comprised of 1,476 single-family homes and townhomes. BBXRE is primarily developing the land and common areas and selling finished lots to third-party homebuilders. Other than in the case of the lots comprising Phase 4, which were sold to a homebuilder as undeveloped lots, the agreements pursuant to which BBXRE is selling finished lots to homebuilders generally provide for a base purchase price that is paid to BBXRE upon the sale of the developed lots to the homebuilders and a contingent purchase price that is calculated as a percentage of the proceeds that the homebuilders receive from the sale of the completed homes. While an estimated amount of the contingent purchase price is recognized in BBXRE’s revenues upon the sale of the lots to the homebuilders, the contingent purchase price is paid to BBXRE upon the closing of such home sales by homebuilders.
 
    5 

  

BBXRE has substantially completed the development of the lots comprising Phases 1 through 3 of the Beacon Lake Community and previously sold the 299 undeveloped lots comprising Phase 4 in a bulk lot sale to a single homebuilder in 2021.
 
The following table summarizes the status of the sale of lots to homebuilders in each phase in the development as of December 31, 2022:
 

 | Phase 1 | | | Phase 2 | | | Phase 3 | | Phase 4 | | Total | 
--------------------------------------+---------+------+---+---------+---------------+------+---------+-----------+---------+---+-------+-----
 | | | | | Single-family | | | Townhomes | | | | | | | 
Total planned lots | | 302 | | | | 479 | | | 196 | | | 200 | | 299 | | 1,476 | 
Lots sold to homebuilders (1) | | (302 | ) | | | (479 | ) | | (196 | ) | | (115 | ) | (299 | ) | (1,391 | )
Remaining lots to sell | | — | | | | — | | | — | | | 85 | | — | | 85 | 
Lots under contract with homebuilders | | — | | | | — | | | — | | | (85 | ) | — | | (85 | )
Available lots | | — | | | | — | | | — | | | — | | — | | — | 


(1) | As further described in Item 8 - Note 2 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, BBXRE generally recognizes revenue related to sales of lots to homebuilders, including an estimate of any contingent purchase price expected to be collected in relation to such lots, upon the closing of the sale of such lots to the homebuilders. Although BBXRE recognizes the expected contingent purchase price associated with such lots upon the closing of the sale to the homebuilders, BBXRE ultimately does not receive any contingent purchase price related to a lot until the homebuilder closes on the sale of a home on the lot and collects the proceeds from the home sale. With respect to the sale of the undeveloped lots comprising Phase 4, BBXRE received the payment of the purchase price for the lots from the homebuilder at the time of closing, subject to certain adjustments contemplated in the agreement, but the agreement related to the transaction does not provide for a contingent purchase price structure similar to the agreements related to the sale of developed lots in Phases 1 through 3.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As noted in the table above, BBXRE had sold all but 85 lots in the Beacon Lake Community as of December 31, 2022, and these lots are now under contract with homebuilders. Accordingly, other than the closing on the sale of the remaining lots, BBXRE has substantially completed its primary activities as the master developer of the Beacon Lake Community.
 
However, BBXRE expects to continue to collect contingent purchase price from homebuilders upon the sale of homes by the homebuilders, and as of December 31, 2022, BBXRE had recognized contingent purchase price receivables totaling $16.9 million related to the sale of lots in the Beacon Lake Community. The following table summarizes the status of the sale of homes by homebuilders on lots in Phases 1 through 3 previously sold by BBXRE to such homebuilders:
 

 | Phase 1 | | Phase 2 | | | Phase 3 | | Total
--------------------------+---------+-----+---------+---------------+-----+---------+-----------+------
 | | | | Single-family | | | Townhomes | | 
Lots sold to homebuilders | | 302 | | | 479 | | | 196 | 115 | 1,092
Homes closed | | 301 | | | 408 | | | 185 | — | 894 
Homes remaining to close | | 1 | | | 71 | | | 11 | 115 | 198 

 
BBXRE financed a portion of the development costs for the Beacon Lake Community through the issuance of Community Development District Bonds. Under the terms of the agreements with the homebuilders, in connection with the sale of the finished lots, BBXRE is required to repay a portion of the bonds with proceeds from such sales, while a portion of the bonds are assumed by the homebuilders.
 
Single-Family Developments with Third Party Developers
 
Marbella
 
As of December 31, 2022, BBXRE had invested $8.1 million in a joint venture with CC Homes to develop Marbella, a residential community comprised of 158 single-family homes in Miramar, Florida. Under the terms of the operating agreement between BBXRE and CC Homes, BBXRE is entitled to receive 70.0% of the joint venture distributions until it receives its aggregate capital contributions plus a specified return on its capital. After BBXRE and CC Homes receive a specified return and the return of their contributed capital, any distributions thereafter are shared based on earnings, with CC Homes, as the managing member, receiving an increasing percentage of distributions.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2022, the joint venture closed on the sale of 126 single-family homes, and BBXRE recognized $12.6 million of equity earnings and received $12.5 million of distributions from the venture. As of December 31, 2022, the joint venture had closed on the sale of all 158 single-family homes in Marbella.

In June 2019, BBXRE invested $4.2 million as one of a number of investors in a joint venture with Label & Co. to develop Sky Cove at Westlake, a residential community comprised of 204 single-family homes in Loxahatchee, Florida. Under the terms of the operating agreement governing the joint venture, BBXRE is entitled to receive 26.25% of the joint venture distributions until it receives its aggregate capital contributions plus a specified return on its capital. After all investors receive a specified return and the return of their contributed capital, any distributions thereafter are shared based on earnings, with Label & Co., as the managing member, receiving an increasing percentage of distributions.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the joint venture closed on the sale of 39 single-family homes, and BBXRE recognized $0.5 million of equity earnings and received $2.1 million of distributions from the venture. As of December 31, 2022, the joint venture had closed on the sale of all 204 single-family homes in Sky Cove.
 
Sky Cove South
 
In February 2021, BBXRE invested $4.9 million as one of a number of investors in a joint venture with Label & Co. to develop Sky Cove South at Westlake, a residential community that is adjacent to Sky Cove at Westlake and is expected to be comprised of 197 single-family homes. BBXRE’s rights to distributions from the Sky Cove South joint venture are substantially the same as its rights to distributions from the Sky Cove joint venture. 
 
During the year ended December 31, 2022, the joint venture closed on the sale of 80 single-family homes, and BBXRE recognized $0.6 million of equity earnings and received $2.1 million of distributions from the venture.  As of December 31, 2022, the joint venture had executed contracts to sell 172 homes in the community and had closed on the sale of 80 homes.
 
Mixed Use Development
 
The Main Las Olas
 
As of December 31, 2022, BBXRE had invested $3.8 million as one of a number of investors in The Main Las Olas joint venture, which was formed to invest in the development of The Main Las Olas, a mixed-used project in downtown Fort Lauderdale, Florida that is comprised of an office tower with approximately 365,000 square feet of leasable area, a residential tower with approximately 341 units, and approximately 45,000 square feet of ground floor retail. Construction was completed during 2022, and as of December 31, 2022, the office tower, residential tower, and retail space were 100%, 92%, and 91% leased, respectively.
 
BBX Capital leases 32,166 square feet of space in the office tower for its corporate headquarters pursuant to a lease agreement with the joint venture that has an initial term that ends in 2032.
 
Legacy Assets
 
BBXRE owns various legacy assets, including loans receivable and real estate formerly held by BankAtlantic, with an aggregate carrying amount of approximately $14.1 million as of December 31, 2022. The majority of the legacy assets do not generate cash flow on a regular or predictable basis and are not expected to do so until the assets are monetized through loan repayments or transactions involving the sale, joint venture, or development of the underlying real estate.
 
BBXRE has generated substantial income from the legacy asset portfolio over the past decade, as the majority of the loans receivable and real estate assets within the portfolio were impaired in prior periods to their estimated fair values during the recession that began in 2007 and 2008. Although BBXRE continues to periodically monetize assets in the legacy asset portfolio for significant profits as a result of the improved market conditions in Florida, as evidenced by the recent sale of 119 acres of vacant land located in St. Lucie County, Florida in December 2022 for a net gain of $23.0 million, BBXRE believes that the monetization of the portfolio is substantially complete and does not expect or forecast significant earnings relating to the remaining assets in future periods.
 
BBXRE is also continuing its efforts to collect legal judgments against past borrowers held in this portfolio, and although such collection efforts have continued to generate income for BBXRE over the past several years, there is significant uncertainty as to the collection of any additional significant amounts in future periods.

BBX Sweet Holdings
 
Business Overview 
 
BBX Sweet Holdings is engaged in the ownership and management of operating businesses in the confectionery industry, including (i) IT’SUGAR, a specialty candy retailer whose products include bulk candy, candy in giant packaging, and licensed and novelty items and which operates in over 100 retail locations that include a mix of high-traffic resort and entertainment, lifestyle, mall/outlet, and urban locations throughout the United States, and (ii) Las Olas Confections and Snacks, a manufacturer and wholesaler of chocolate and other confectionery products which also operates several Hoffman’s Chocolates retail locations in South Florida
 
BBXSH owns over 90% of the equity interest in IT’SUGAR. Prior to September 22, 2020, the Company consolidated the financial statements of IT’SUGAR and its subsidiaries as a result of its over 90% ownership of IT’SUGAR. However, as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its operations, on September 22, 2020, IT’SUGAR and its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions to reorganize under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the U.S. Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida (the “Bankruptcy Court”) (the cases commenced by such filings, the “Bankruptcy Cases”), and as a result of the filings and the uncertainties surrounding the nature, timing, and specifics of the bankruptcy proceedings, the Company deconsolidated IT’SUGAR on September 22, 2020. On June 16, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed IT’SUGAR’s plan of reorganization, and the plan became effective on June 17, 2021 (the “Effective Date”). Pursuant to the terms of the plan, BBX Sweet Holdings’ equity interests in IT’SUGAR were revested on the Effective Date, and all organizational documents of IT’SUGAR were assumed, ratified, and reinstated. As a result of the confirmation and effectiveness of the plan and the revesting of its equity interests in IT’SUGAR, the Company was deemed to have reacquired a controlling financial interest in IT’SUGAR and consolidated the results of IT’SUGAR into its consolidated financial statements as of the Effective Date, the date that the Company reacquired control of IT’SUGAR. See Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 23 in Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion related to the Bankruptcy Cases.
 
Strategy
 
There are certain significant differences amongst BBX Sweet Holdings’ operating businesses, which have distinct business and operating strategies reflecting their respective business models. 
 
IT’SUGAR’s business and operating strategy is primarily focused on:
 

● | Driving traffic and sales by creating a “retailtainment” experience for customers, including developing creative and humorous product content; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Developing and leveraging industry relationships and establishing itself as a vehicle through which brands can market and sell their products at “retailtainment” locations specifically focused on candy products and candy-themed merchandise; 
● | Expanding on the recent success of its “candy department store” concept in select high-traffic resort and entertainment locations across the United States (as implemented in retail locations at American Dream in New Jersey and the Ala Moana Center in Honolulu, Hawaii);
● | Improving the quality and remaining maturity of its store portfolio by (i) extending the lease terms of its existing successful retail locations, (ii) expanding the size of certain existing retail locations, and (iii) closing retail locations where appropriate; and 
● | Opening “pop up” retail locations in select markets in order to test the markets for the viability of potential longer-term locations. 

 
Las Olas Confections and Snacks’ business and operating strategy is primarily focused on:
 

● | Improving its gross margin and profitability through (i) the elimination of existing products with low margins, (ii) process improvements and efficiencies, and (iii) reductions in product and operating costs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Selling its Hoffman chocolate products at its six South Florida retail stores: and 
● | Growing its market share in certain core confectionery products, including chocolate, coconut, and taffy products. 

 
During 2022, the Company sold Hoffman’s Chocolates’ manufacturing facility in Greenacres, Florida as part of its efforts to improve its gross margin and profitability. As a result of the sale, substantially all of the products previously manufactured at the Hoffman’s Chocolates facility are now manufactured in the Las Olas Confections and Snacks facility in Orlando, Florida. 
 
Renin
 
Business Overview
 
Renin is engaged in the design, manufacture, and distribution of sliding doors, door systems and hardware, and home décor products and operates through its headquarters in Canada and manufacturing and distribution facilities in the United States and Canada. In addition to its own manufacturing activities, Renin sources various products and materials from China, Brazil, and certain other countries. In October 2020, Renin acquired Colonial Elegance, a supplier and distributor of building products that was headquartered in Montreal, Canada. Colonial Elegance’s products included barn doors, closet doors, and stair parts, and its customers included big box retailers in the United States and Canada which were complementary to and expanded Renin’s existing customer base.
 
    8 

  

Renin’s products are primarily sold through three channels in North America:
 

● | Retail – Includes sales to big box retailers, including Lowe’s (U.S. and Canada), Rona (Canada), Home Depot (U.S. and Canada), and Menards;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Commercial – Includes sales to original equipment manufacturers and fabricators; and 
● | Direct Installation – Installation of door systems in newly constructed homes, condominiums, and apartments in the greater Toronto area. 

 
For the year ended December 31, 2022, Renin’s retail, commercial, and direct installation channels comprised approximately 69%, 21%, and 10%, respectively, of its gross sales.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2022, Renin’s total revenues included $107.1 million of trade sales to three major customers and their affiliates and $46.9 million of revenues generated outside the United States. For the year ended December 31, 2022, revenues from the three major customers and their affiliates respectively represented $49.6 million (or 14.5%), $37.9 million (or 11.1%,), and $19.6 million (or 5.7%) of the Company’s total revenues. Renin’s long-lived assets located outside the United States, which includes properties, equipment, and right of use assets, had a carrying amount of $16.1 million as of December 31, 2022.
 
Strategy
 
Renin’s business and operating strategy is primarily focused on:
 

● | Increasing sales and market share by delivering outstanding customer service; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Lowering product and manufacturing costs through (i) improvements in product sourcing and logistics, (ii) manufacturing efficiencies, and (iii) consolidating manufacturing and logistics facilities where appropriate;
● | Balancing an appropriate mix between domestic manufacturing and global sourcing of finished goods in light of market conditions; and 
● | Reducing customer lead-times through improved inventory planning. 

 
There is no assurance that the strategies of our principal holdings, as discussed above, will be successful.
 
Other Investments
 
In addition to its principal holdings, the Company has investments in other operating businesses, including a restaurant located in South Florida that was acquired through a loan foreclosure and an insurance agency.  However, in February 2023, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of its insurance agency business, although the entity will continue to provide risk management advisory services to the Company and its affiliates, including Bluegreen Vacations.
Regulatory Matters
 
As a public company, the Company is subject to federal securities laws, including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). In addition, the companies in which BBX Capital holds investments are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations generally applicable to their respective businesses.
 
The Company collects, processes, and retains large volumes of internal and customer data, including social security numbers, credit card numbers, and other personally identifiable information of its employees and customers, in various internal information systems. The Company also transmits some of this information to third party service providers. The regulatory environment, as well as the requirements imposed on the Company by the payment card industry surrounding information, security, and privacy is increasingly demanding, in both the United States and other jurisdictions in which the Company operates. From time to time, information comes to our attention that our internal information systems, including our payment processing systems, fail to fully comply with applicable requirements and regulations. Such requirements and regulations may include, without limitation, the Florida Information Protection Act (FIPA), the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA), and the Consumer Credit Protection Act (CCPA). Upon receipt of such information, we immediately seek to remediate the issues, both directly and with our third-party service providers.
 
See “Item 1A – Risk Factors” for a description of risks with respect to regulatory compliance.
 
Seasonality 
 
BBX Sweet Holdings’ businesses are subject to seasonal fluctuations in trade sales, which cause fluctuations in BBX Sweet Holdings’ quarterly results of operations. Historically, IT’SUGAR has generated its strongest retail trade sales during the months from June through August, as well as during the month of December, when families are generally on vacation, while Las Olas Confections and Snacks has generated its strongest trade sales during the fourth quarter in connection with various holidays in the United States.
Human Resources
 
As of December 31, 2022, the Company and its subsidiaries had approximately 1,553 employees, including 986 employees at IT’SUGAR. We believe that our employee relations are satisfactory and that our employees are important to achieving our business objectives.

BBX Capital seeks to offer competitive compensation and benefit programs for our employees in our effort to attract and retain employees. In addition to competitive base wages, additional programs currently include: incentive compensation plans, long-term incentive plans, company matched 401(k) plans, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, and employee assistance programs.
 
We are committed to foster an inclusive work environment that supports our workforce and the communities we serve, and we seek to hire the best qualified employees regardless of gender, ethnicity, or other protected traits and to fully comply with all laws applicable to discrimination in the workplace.
 
We are committed to maintaining a work environment where employees are treated with dignity and respect and are free from the threat of discrimination and harassment. We believe these same standards should apply to all stakeholders and to our interactions with customers, vendors, and independent contractors.
 
We are proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer. Our policies prohibit discrimination in hiring or advancement against any individual on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, sex, national origin, age, marital status, pregnancy, physical or mental disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law.
 
We strive to ensure our employees have access to working conditions that provide a safe and healthy environment, free from work-related injuries and illnesses. We encourage employees to raise concerns about actual or suspected misconduct.
 
Competition
 
The industries in which the Company conducts its business are very competitive, and BBX Capital also faces substantial competition with respect to its investment activities from real estate investors and developers, private equity funds, hedge funds, and other institutional investors. BBX Capital competes with institutions and entities that are larger and have greater resources than the resources available to BBX Capital.
 
BBXRE invests in the development of multifamily apartment communities. Due to the historically strong performance of this class of asset within the real estate market and the recent increase in demand for housing in the markets in which BBXRE and the Altman Companies operate, BBXRE has experienced increased competition from other real estate investors and developers, which has resulted in an increase in the cost of land and limits the number of available development opportunities in the markets in which BBXRE and the Altman Companies operate.
 
Renin’s products are primarily sold to large retailers and wholesalers, and it experiences intense competition from others, including importers of foreign products.
 
Four unaffiliated companies in the confectionery industry currently account for the majority of the industry’s revenues, reflecting significant concentration and competition in the industry in which BBX Sweet Holdings operates.
 
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As an emerging growth company, we can take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies, including reduced financial disclosure, reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements, exemption from the requirements to hold non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or shareholder approval of golden parachute payments, and exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. We expect to continue to take advantage of certain of the exemptions available to emerging growth companies until December 31, 2025 (the end of the fifth fiscal year following the initial public issuance of our common stock in connection with the spin-off from Bluegreen Vacations) or such earlier time that we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue, more than $700.0 million in market value of our stock is held by non-affiliates, or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt securities over a three-year period.
