Item 1.  Business
General
 
Founded in 2006 and headquartered in Cupertino, California, Aemetis, Inc. (collectively with its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis referred to herein as, “Aemetis,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is an international renewable natural gas, and renewable fuels company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of innovative negative carbon intensity products and technologies that replace traditional petroleum-based products. We operate in three reportable segments consisting of “California Ethanol,” “California Dairy Renewable Natural Gas,” and “India Biodiesel.” We have other operating segments determined not to be reportable segments and are collectively represented by the “All Other” category. At Aemetis, our mission is to generate sustainable and innovative renewable fuel solutions that benefit communities and restore our environment. We do this by building a local circular bioeconomy utilizing agricultural waste to produce low carbon, advanced renewable fuels that reduce greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and improve air quality by replacing traditional petroleum-based products. For revenue and other information regarding our operating segments, see Note 11 - Segment Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
 
Our California Ethanol segment consists of a 65 million gallon per year capacity ethanol production facility located in Keyes, California (the “Keyes Plant”) that we own and operate. In addition to low carbon renewable fuel ethanol, the Keyes Plant produces Wet Distillers Grains (“WDG”), Distillers Corn Oil (“DCO”), Carbon Dioxide (“CO2”) and Condensed Distillers Solubles (“CDS”), all of which are sold as animal feed to more than 80 local dairies and feedlots, with CO₂ sold to food, beverage, and industrial customers. We have several energy efficiency initiatives focused on significantly lowering the carbon intensity of our fuels, primarily by decreasing our use of petroleum-based natural gas. These energy efficiency projects include: high efficiency heat exchangers; the Mitsubishi ZEBREXTM ethanol dehydration system; a two-megawatt solar microgrid with battery storage; the Allen Bradley Decision Control System (DCS) to manage and optimize energy use and other plant operations; and the Mechanical Vapor Recompression (MVR) system to reuse steam.  These projects are expected to reduce petroleum natural gas use by converting key Keyes Plant processes to use electricity rather than natural gas and powering systems using low-carbon-intensity hydroelectric electricity or electricity produced onsite from solar panels.
 
In the third quarter of 2022, we completed the installation and began the operation of the ZEBREXTM ethanol dehydration system at the Keyes Plant, a key first step in the electrification of the Keyes Plant, that is expected to significantly reduce the use of petroleum-based natural gas as process energy at the plant. The electrification, along with the future installation of the two-megawatt zero carbon intensity solar microgrid system and the mechanical vapor recompression (MVR) system, will significantly reduce GHG emissions from the production facility and decrease the carbon intensity (CI) of fuel produced at the Keyes Plant.  The lower CI of ethanol produced at the Keyes Plant will allow us to realize a higher price for the ethanol produced and sold at the Keyes Plant.

Our California Dairy Renewable Natural segment Aemetis Biogas or “ABGL,” constructs and operates bio-methane anaerobic digesters at local dairies near the Keyes Plant (many of whom also purchase WDG produced by the Keyes Plant as animal feed); transports the biogas via pipeline to the Keyes Plant site; converts the biogas to Renewable Natural Gas (“RNG”) which is then delivered to customers through the PG&E natural gas pipeline.
 
The Aemetis Biogas network includes the Aemetis Biogas Central Dairy Project, which operates 40 miles of completed biogas pipeline; four operating dairy digesters; five dairy digesters that are under construction; a centralized biogas-to-RNG conversion facility located at the Keyes Plant site; and a renewable natural gas interconnection with the PG&E utility gas pipeline. A total of 30 dairies have signed contracts with Aemetis Biogas in connection with participation in the Aemetis Biogas Central Dairy Project. 
 
The dairy digesters are connected via an underground private pipeline owned by Aemetis to a gas cleanup and compression unit at the Keyes Plant to produce dairy renewable natural gas (“RNG”). Upon receiving the bio-methane from the dairies, impurities are removed, and the bio-methane is converted to negative carbon intensity RNG that is injected into the statewide PG&E gas utility pipeline for use as transportation fuel or used as renewable process energy at the Keyes Plant.
 
Our India Biodiesel segment owns and operates a plant in Kakinada, India (“Kakinada Plant”) with a nameplate capacity of 150 thousand metric tons per year, or about 50 million gallons per year, producing high quality distilled biodiesel and refined glycerin for customers in India and Europe. We believe the Kakinada Plant is one of the largest biodiesel production facilities in India on a nameplate capacity basis. Kakinada Plant is capable of processing a variety of vegetable oils and animal fat waste feedstocks into biodiesel that meets international product standards. Our Kakinada Plant can also distill the crude glycerin byproduct from the biodiesel refining process into refined glycerin, which is sold to the pharmaceutical, personal care, paint, adhesive, and other industries.
 
Our All Other segment consists of: Carbon Zero biofuels production plants to produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel; Carbon Capture and Sequestration compression system and injection wells; a research and development facility in Minneapolis, Minnesota; and our corporate offices in Cupertino, California.
 
Our Carbon Zero biofuels production plants are designed to produce low or negative carbon intensity sustainable aviation fuel (“SAF”) and renewable diesel fuel (“RD”) utilizing low carbon hydroelectric electricity, renewable hydrogen and non-edible renewable oils sourced from existing Aemetis biofuels plants and other sources. The first Carbon Zero plant is scheduled to be built in Riverbank, California at the 125-acre former Riverbank Army ammunition plant.  The Riverbank plant is expected to utilize zero carbon hydroelectric and other renewable power available onsite to produce 90 million gallons per year of SAF, RD, and other byproducts. The plant is expected to supply the aviation and truck markets with ultra-low carbon renewable fuels to reduce GHG emissions and other pollutants associated with conventional petroleum-based fuels. By producing ultra-low carbon renewable fuels, the Company expects to capture high value D3 Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”) under the federal Renewable Fuel Standard (“RFS”), generate California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (“LCFS”) credits, and produce Inflation Reduction Act tax credits.
 
Our Carbon Capture subsidiary was established to build Carbon Capture and Sequestration (“CCS”) projects that generate LCFS and IRS 45Q tax credits by compressing and injecting CO₂ into deep wells which are monitored for emissions to ensure the long-term sequestration of carbon underground. California’s Central Valley has been identified as one of the world’s most favorable regions for large-scale CO₂ injection projects due to the subsurface geologic formation that absorbs and retains CO₂ gas. The two initial Aemetis CCS injection projects are expected to capture and sequester more than two million metric tons per year of CO₂ at the Aemetis biofuels plant sites in Keyes and Riverbank, California. In July 2022, Aemetis purchased 24 acres located on the Riverbank Industrial Complex site in Riverbank, California to develop a CCS injection well with more than 1 million metric tonnes per year of CO₂ sequestration capacity. The Company plans to construct a characterization well at each site to obtain soil information for permitting as required for the EPA Class VI CO₂ injection well permit application.
 
Our Minneapolis, Minnesota research and development laboratory develops efficient conversion technologies using low carbon intensity and waste feedstocks to produce low or below zero carbon intensity biofuels and biochemicals. We are focused on processes that extract sugar from cellulosic feedstocks and then utilize the remaining biomass to produce low carbon renewable hydrogen for the production of sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and potentially sale of renewable hydrogen to third parties as transportation fuel.

Strategy
 
Key elements of our strategy include:
 
California Ethanol
 
Diversify and expand revenue and cash flow by continuing to improve the energy efficiency of the Keyes Plant as well as develop and adopt value-added by-product processing systems and optimize other systems.  In April 2012, we installed a DCO extraction unit at the Keyes Plant and began extracting corn oil for sale into the livestock feed market.  During 2014, we installed a second oil extraction system to further improve corn oil yields from this process. During late 2017, we entered into agreements to sell substantially all of the CO₂ produced at the Keyes Plant to Messer Gas, which built a liquid CO₂ plant adjacent to the Keyes Plant on five acres of land owned by Aemetis that became operational in the second quarter of 2020. During the third quarter of 2022, we installed and are now commissioning a Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation ZEBREXTM ethanol dehydration system as a key first step in the electrification of the Keyes Plant. The electrification of the Keyes Plant is expected to significantly reduces our use of petroleum-based natural gas, which lowers the carbon intensity of our fuel ethanol. We have plans to install an MVR system that allows for the compression of process vapor to steam which is expected to result in a significant reduction of petroleum natural gas consumption.  Additionally, we are developing the Aemetis Integrated Solar Microgrid Systems (AIMS) with battery backup that allows for the displacement of natural gas electricity with zero carbon intensity electricity, which is expected to be completed at the Keyes Plant in the third quarter of 2023. We continue to evaluate and, as allowed by available financing and free cash flow from operations, adopt additional value-added processes that decrease costs and increase the value of the ethanol, WDG, DCO, CDS, and CO₂ produced at the Keyes Plant with an emphasis on processes that provide low-cost or cellulosic-based feedstocks to augment current feedstocks.
California Dairy Renewable Natural Gas
 
Leverage our position as owner/operator of animal feed production to build dairy digesters and connected pipeline to expand the network thereby increasing revenues and profitability. In December 2018, we benefited from our established relationship with more than 80 California’s Central Valley dairies by signing leases and raising funds to construct dairy digesters that collect bio-methane and build pipelines that convey bio-methane to our Keyes Plant.  We have constructed our first four digesters, and expect to have three more dairy digesters operational by the end of March 2023, installed forty miles of biogas pipeline, and commenced operations of the initial pipeline and digesters in the third quarter of 2020.  During 2022, we constructed a centralized biogas cleanup and renewable natural gas interconnection with the PG&E pipeline. We also secured low-cost, USDA guaranteed financing at a 5.95% fixed interest and has an USDA annual renewal fee of 0.25%, with interest only payments to be paid in monthly installments, and a maturity date of March 4, 2023, for the construction of six dairies and related systems. We plan to continue to use this financing mechanism for future diary construction. In addition, we have signed agreements with approximately 30 additional dairies to construct additional dairy digesters. We plan on progressing our business plan by continuing to expand the dairy digesters and pipeline network.
India Biodiesel
 
Capitalize on recent policy changes by the Government of India. We plan to continue to pursue sales of biodiesel to Oil Marketing Companies (“OMC’s”) which are owned by the Indian government, as well as sales to traditional bulk, fleet, industrial, retail, and transportation biodiesel markets in India. We believe these markets have become more attractive as a result of potential changes to government tax structures and policies, as well as new marketing channels that may open as a result of changes to government policy. New taxation is expected to be enforced beginning in April 2023, as a Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) on diesel sales has encouraged the procurement of biodiesel by the OMC’s and private oil refiners in India.
Pursue tender offers from Government Oil Marketing Companies. We plan to continue to qualify and bid on contracts under the Indian government's updated 2022 National Biofuels Policy of mixing biodiesel at a 5% blend ratio with diesel. During the third and fourth quarters of 2022, our Kakinada Plant bid and won supply contracts to supply biodiesel to the government Oil Marketing Companies: Hindustan Petroleum, Bharat Petroleum, and Indian Oil Corporation. During 2022, the formula for setting the OMC offer price was modified to allow biodiesel producers in India to begin production and supply of product at economically viable levels under these contracts. 
 
Diversify our feedstocks from India.  We designed our Kakinada Plant with the capability to produce biodiesel from multiple feedstocks and plan to continue efforts to procure and process these diversified feedstocks where and when economically feasible. In 2009, we began to produce biodiesel from a variety of plant-based feedstocks. Between 2014 and 2019, we further diversified our feedstock to include animal oils and fats, as well as refined, bleached and deodorized stearin, crude stearin, and RBD stearin. In 2018, we completed a pretreatment unit at the Kakinada Plant to convert up to 5% high free fatty acid (“FFA”) feedstocks into oil that can be used to produce biodiesel, which was further upgraded in 2019 to convert up to 20% high FFA feedstocks, both of which are available at lower cost than our traditional feedstocks. We are now utilizing a proprietary pre-treatment process to utilize lower-cost Fatty Acid Distillate to produce biodiesel. During 2021, the Company, after receiving approval from the Pollution Control Board of India for use of Refined Animal Tallow for production of biodiesel, began procuring Refined Animal Tallow. The Company has built animal tallow refining capacity and is exploring the export of Refined Animal Tallow to the United States for sale to producers of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel.
 
    5 

  
Develop and commercially deploy technologies to produce high-margin products. We plan to continue investing in the conversion of lower quality, waste oils into higher value biofuels, including renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuels. Additionally, we continue to evaluate improvements to the throughput capacity and efficiency of our production facilities.  We plan to invest in those areas that allow for more efficient and higher throughput for the processing of biodiesel and refined glycerin.  The technologies for these conversion process may be licensed from third parties or internally developed.
 
Evaluate and pursue technology acquisition opportunities.  We intend to evaluate and pursue opportunities to acquire technologies and processes that result in accretive earnings opportunities as financial resources and business prospects make the acquisition of these technologies and processes advisable. In addition, we may also seek to acquire companies, or enter into licensing agreements or form joint ventures with companies that offer prospects for the adoption of accretive earnings business opportunities.
 
Other Initiatives
 
Leverage technology for the development and production of additional advanced biofuels and renewable chemicals. We continue to evaluate new technology, develop technologies under our existing patents and conduct research and development to produce low or negative carbon intensity advanced biofuels from renewable feedstocks. Our objective is to continue to commercialize our portfolio of technologies and expand the adoption of these advanced biofuels and bio-chemicals technologies.
 
We hold certain rights to technologies for the conversion of orchard, forest, dairy, and construction and demolition waste wood into low carbon renewable fuel.  We intend to utilize this technology to produce renewable hydrogen for use in the production of SAF and diesel fuel at the Riverbank Carbon Zero facility using agricultural biomass waste abundantly available from orchard waste wood in California’s Central Valley. We intend to expand production facilities to build additional plants in California to utilize the estimated 1.6 million tons of annual waste orchard wood in Central California, as well as other waste wood feedstocks.
 
Leverage site control of our Keyes and Riverbank properties to construct production plants to produce low carbon and negative carbon intensity products. Initiatives are underway to construct facilities that produce SAF and renewable diesel at our Riverbank location, and to generate LCFS and IRS 45Q credits by injecting CO₂ into wells at both our Keyes Plant and Riverbank locations.  Upon completion of construction and startup, these projects are expected to increase revenues and cash flows.
 
Leverage tax and other governmental incentives to supplement financial performance.  We have initiatives underway to realize the financial incentive provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 by qualifying for renewable energy credits, whether in the form of an Investment Tax Credit, Producers Tax Credit or other credits and monetize the credits using the transferability provisions of this act.
 
Acquire, license our technologies to, or joint venture with other ethanol and biodiesel plants.  There are approximately 200 ethanol plants that are operational in the U.S., as well as biofuels plants in Brazil, Argentina, India and elsewhere in the world that could be upgraded to expand revenues and improve their cash flow using technology commercially deployed or licensed by us.  After developing and commercially demonstrating technologies at the Keyes Plant, Kakinada Plant and the Riverbank Facility, we will evaluate on an opportunistic basis the benefit of acquiring ownership stakes in other biofuel production facilities and/or entering into joint venture or licensing agreements with other ethanol, renewable diesel or renewable SAF facilities.
 
Evaluate and pursue technology acquisition opportunities.  We intend to evaluate and pursue opportunities to acquire technologies and processes that result in accretive value opportunities as financial resources and business prospects make the acquisition of these technologies and processes advisable. In addition, we may also seek to acquire companies, enter into licensing agreements or form joint ventures with companies that offer prospects for the adoption of technologies that would be accretive to earnings.
 
Additionally, we continue to evaluate technologies from our existing and planned operations for the development of the property in Goodland, Kansas.

2022 Highlights
 
California Ethanol
 
During 2022, we produced five products: denatured fuel ethanol, WDG, DCO, CO₂, and CDS. We sell the ethanol we produce through a single fuel marketing company, Murex LLC ("Murex"). We own the ethanol stored in our finished goods tank and deliver this ethanol directly to our fuel marketing company customers. WDG are sold to A.L. Gilbert and DCO is sold to other customers under the J.D. Heiskell Purchase Agreement. CDS are sold to various local third parties. We began selling CO₂ to Messer Gas in the second quarter of 2020. California Ethanol revenue is dependent on the price of ethanol, WDG, CDS, and DCO.
 
The following table sets forth information about our production and sales of ethanol and WDG in 2022 and 2021:

California Dairy Renewable Natural Gas
 
During 2021, we used biogas from our diary digesters and pipeline network to supply boilers at our Keyes Plant, and accordingly monetize the gas produced with a lower carbon intensity score attached to the related ethanol sales.  During 2022, we constructed a centralized biogas cleanup and renewable natural gas interconnection with the PG&E pipeline, and began utilizing this connection to deliver dairy RNG to the PG&E interconnect, and further allow for the storage of this gas, while we await the verification of our dairy digester pathways.

Competition
 
California Ethanol – According to the U.S. Energy Information Agency (the “EIA”), on January 1, 2022, there were approximately 192 commercial ethanol production facilities in the U.S. with a combined production of approximately 17.4 billion gallons per year. The production of ethanol is a commodity-based business where producers compete on the basis of price. We sell ethanol into the Northern California market. However, since there is insufficient production capacity in California to supply the state’s total fuel ethanol consumption (in excess of 1.5 billion gallons annually), we compete with ethanol transported into California from Midwestern producers or imported from other countries, primarily Brazil. Similarly, our co-products, principally WDG and DCO, are sold into local California markets and compete with DDG and DCO imported into the California markets as well as with alternative feed products.
California Dairy Renewable Natural Gas – Dairy renewable natural gas competes with other renewable gas or petroleum-based natural gas for the value of the gas molecule and competes with dairy RNG, landfill biogas, or other biofuels for qualifying volumes of renewable biofuel volumes under the federal Renewable Fuel Standard and the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard.  When used as a component of the energy inputs at our Keyes plant, the dairy renewable natural gas results in a lower pathway score, allowing us to sell ethanol into the market with the more valuable carbon attributes, and competing on the same basis as our California ethanol. At the present time, the highest value for dairy based RNG is in the transportation fuel market.
India Biodiesel – With respect to biodiesel sold as fuel, we compete primarily with the producers of petroleum diesel, consisting of the three Government Oil Marketing Companies:  Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum, and two private oil companies:  Reliance Petroleum and Essar Oil, all of whom have significantly larger market shares than we do and control a significant share of the distribution network.  These competitors also purchase our product for blending and further sales to their customers.  We compete primarily on the basis of price, quality and reliable delivery, since our plant can produce distilled biodiesel and has historically been a more reliable and high-quality supplier than some other biodiesel producers in India. 
 
With respect to biodiesel sold directly to fleets and other customers, we supply logistics companies that operate fleets of trucks, ocean port facilities with extensive trucking activities, beverage distributors, cement ready-mix suppliers, mining companies, infrastructure companies, and other companies that use diesel for transportation.
 
With respect to crude and refined glycerin, we compete with other glycerin producers and refiners selling products into the personal care, paints and adhesive markets primarily on the basis of price and product quality.
 
Customers
 
California Ethanol – We sell 100% of the ethanol we produce through a Fuel Ethanol Purchase and Sale Agreement with Murex LLC, who markets 100% of our fuel ethanol. WDG are sold to A.L.Gilbert and DCO is sold to other customers under the J.D.Heiskell Purchasing Agreement. CDS are sold to various local third parties. We began selling CO₂ to Messer Gas in the second quarter of 2020. California Ethanol revenue is dependent on the price of ethanol, WDG, CDS, and DCO.
California Dairy Renewable Natural Gas – During 2021, we sold 100% of the biogas produced to the California Ethanol plant for use in the production of ethanol. During 2022, we completed the construction of the interconnection with the statewide utility pipeline and are now able to sell to a broader range of customers. We are developing the capability to dispense fuel through a RNG station at or near the California Ethanol plant.
India Biodiesel – During 2022, we derived 96%, and 4% of our sales from biodiesel and other sales, respectively. Our OMC customers accounted for 95% of biodiesel sales of our consolidated India Biodiesel segment revenues. During 2021, we derived 67%, 18%, and 15% of our sales from biodiesel, refined glycerin, and other sales respectively. One biodiesel customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated India Biodiesel segment revenues at 66% and one refined glycerin customer accounted for 16% of our consolidated India Biodiesel segment revenues in 2021.
 
    8 

  
Pricing
 
California Ethanol – Revenue is primarily dependent on the price of ethanol, WDG, and DCO. Ethanol pricing is influenced by local and national inventory and production levels, imported ethanol, corn prices and gasoline demand, and is determined pursuant to a marketing agreement with a single fuel marketing customer and is generally based on daily and monthly pricing for ethanol delivered to the San Francisco Bay Area, California, as published by Oil Price Information Service (“OPIS”), as well as quarterly contracts negotiated by our marketing company with local fuel blenders. The price for WDG is influenced by the price of corn, the supply and price of dried distillers grains, and demand from the local dairy and feed markets and determined monthly pursuant to a marketing agreement with A.L. Gilbert and is generally determined in reference to the local price of dried distillers grains and other comparable feed products. Our revenue is further influenced by the price of natural gas, our decision to operate the Keyes Plant at various capacity levels, conduct required maintenance, and respond to biological processes affecting output.
California Dairy Renewable Natural Gas – Revenue is dependent on the price of petroleum natural gas, the price of alternative sources of renewable gas in the market, the value of environmental attributes and the method for selling the gas. Renewable natural gas pricing is influenced by local and national inventory levels, local and national gas production, petroleum natural gas production, and value of the related environmental attributes.  Further pricing is determined by the method of distribution and use, with each of the uses (transportation fuel dispensed at renewable natural gas fueling stations or replacement of natural gas at the California Ethanol plant, sell through the natural gas pipeline, or sell directly through renewable natural gas stations) providing separate pricing options. 
India Biodiesel – During 2022, the formula for setting the OMC offer price was modified to allow biodiesel producers in India to begin production and supply of product at economically viable levels under these contracts. In India, the price of biodiesel is based on the price of petroleum diesel, which floats with changes in the price determined by the international markets. Biodiesel sold into Europe is based on the spot market price, but a recent Indian government ban on exports closed this market for the Company for the time being. We sell our biodiesel primarily to Government Oil Marketing Companies, transport companies, resellers, distributors and private refiners on an as-needed basis.  We have no long-term sales contracts.  Our biodiesel pricing is related to the price of petroleum diesel, and the increase in the price of petroleum diesel is expected to favorably impact the profitability of our India operations.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
 
California Ethanol – We entered into a Corn Procurement and Working Capital Agreement with J.D. Heiskell in March 2011, which we amended in May 2020 (the “Heiskell Supply Agreement”). Under the Heiskell Supply Agreement, we agreed to procure number two yellow dent corn from J.D. Heiskell, with the ability to obtain corn from other sources subject to certain conditions. However, in 2021 and 2022, all our corn supply was purchased from J.D. Heiskell pursuant to the Heiskell Supply Agreement.  Title to the corn and risk of loss pass to us when the corn is deposited into our weigh scale.  The agreement is automatically renewed for additional one-year terms. The current term is set to expire on December 31, 2023, with automatic renewals for additional one-year terms.
California Dairy Renewable Natural Gas – Biogas is produced by anerobic digesters located on property that Aemetis leases from dairy operators.  We construct and own the dairy digesters and pipeline that connects the digesters together and feeds biogas into our gas clean up unit located at our California Ethanol plant for the production of RNG. Our dairy agreements include a land lease and manure supply agreement with the dairy where the digester is located. Generally, these leases are for 20-25 years with 10 year options to renew and are based upon the herd size and value of environmental attributes.
India Biodiesel – In 2022 and 2021, a significant amount of our biodiesel was derived from processing refined palm stearin, which was sourced locally. The byproduct of using high fat RBD/crude palm stearin is PFAD, which can be processed further into biodiesel or sold directly as a product into the market. During 2021, the Company, after receiving approval from the Pollution Control Board of India for use of Refined Animal Tallow for production of biodiesel, began procuring Refined Animal Tallow. The Indian biodiesel industry is requesting the Indian government to allow the export of biodiesel to other countries. The Company is exploring the export of Animal Tallow based biodiesel to California to capture LCFS credits. In addition to feedstock, the Kakinada Plant requires quantities of methanol and chemical catalysts for use in the biodiesel production process.  These chemicals are also readily available and sourced from a number of suppliers surrounding the Kakinada Plant.  We are not dependent on sole source or limited source suppliers for any of our raw materials or chemicals.
Sales and Marketing
 
California Ethanol – We sell 100% of the ethanol we produce through a Fuel Ethanol Purchase and Sale Agreement with Murex, who markets 100% of our fuel ethanol. WDG are sold to A.L.Gilbert and DCO is sold to other customers under the J.D.Heiskell Purchasing Agreement. CDS are sold to various local third parties. We began selling CO₂ to Messer Gas in the second quarter of 2020.
 
    9 

  
In March 2011, we entered into a WDG Purchase and Sale Agreement with A.L. Gilbert, pursuant to which A.L. Gilbert agreed to market, on an exclusive basis, all of the WDG we produce. The current term is set to expire on December 31, 2023 with automatic one-year renewals.
 
In October 2021, we entered into Fuel Ethanol Purchase and Sale Agreement with Murex, who now markets 100% of our fuel ethanol. The initial term of our agreement with Murex ends on October 31, 2023, with automatic one-year renewals thereafter.
 
California Dairy Renewable Natural Gas – During 2021, we sold 100% of the biogas produced to the California Ethanol plant for use in the production of ethanol. During 2022, we completed construction of  our pipeline and interconnection with the utility gas pipeline and are now able to sell to a broader range of customers across the state.  We are developing the capability to dispense fuel through a RNG station at or near the California Ethanol plant.
India Biodiesel - We sell our biodiesel and refined glycerin to (i) end-users utilizing our own sales force and independent sales agents, (ii) brokers who resell the product to end-users and (iii) Government Oil Marketing Companies.  We pay a sales commission on sales arranged by independent sales agents.
Commodity Risk Management Practices
 
California Ethanol – The cost of corn and the price of ethanol are volatile and the correlation of the pricing of these commodities form the basis for the profit margin at our Keyes Plant.  We are, therefore, exposed to commodity price risk.  Our risk management strategy is to operate in the physical market by purchasing corn and selling ethanol on a daily basis at the then prevailing market price.  We monitor these prices daily to test for an overall positive variable contribution margin. We periodically explore and utilize methods of mitigating the volatility of our commodity prices through hedging strategies. We sold our WDG during 2022 on a month-to-month basis, however, we monitor and periodically sell on a quarterly basis when we believe longer term contracts allow us to better manage commodity and pricing risk.
California Dairy Renewable Natural Gas – The cost of leasing and operating dairy digesters is dependent on the size of the dairy herd and the value of the environmental attributes.  The price of renewable natural gas is volatile and uncorrelated with the cost of feedstock. We therefore are exposed to ongoing and substantial market price risk for our supply of dairy natural gas. Our risk management strategy is to arrange for the payment to dairy operators based, in part, upon the value of the environmental attributes, specifically the LCFS in order to reduce this lack of market correlation.  We monitor these prices daily to test for an overall positive variable contribution margin. 
India Biodiesel – The cost of crude or refined palm stearin and the price of biodiesel are volatile and are generally uncorrelated. We therefore are exposed to ongoing and substantial commodity price risk at our Kakinada plant.  Our risk management strategy is to produce biodiesel in India only when we believe we can generate positive gross margins and to idle the Kakinada Plant during periods of low or negative gross margins.  Additionally, we are pursuing relationships with large oil companies and trading partners pursuant to which we may match the procurement of feedstocks with the production of biofuels for sales that provide a fixed margin. 
 
In addition, to minimize our commodity risk, we modified the processes within our facility to utilize lower cost crude palm stearin and palm-based products with high FFA content, which enables us to reduce our feedstock costs.  The price of our biodiesel is generally indexed to the local price of petroleum diesel, which floats with changes in the price determined by the international markets.
 
We have in the past, and we may in the future, use forward purchase contracts and other hedging strategies. However, the extent to which we engage in these risk management strategies may vary substantially from time to time depending on market conditions and other factors.
 
Research and Development
 
Our research and development efforts consist of developing, evaluating, and commercializing technologies and expanding the production of SAF, renewable diesel fuel, and other renewable bio-chemicals in the United States and India. The objective of this development activity is to bring efficient conversion technologies using waste feedstocks to produce biofuels and biochemicals on a large-scale, commercial basis.  Some of our innovations are protected by issued or pending patents. We are developing additional technology and expect to file additional patents that will further strengthen our intellectual property portfolio.  We expect to continue to file and protect patents related to our business and future plans.

Patents and Trademarks
 
We filed a number of trademark applications within the U.S.  We do not consider the success of our business, as a whole, to be dependent on these trademarks.  In addition, we hold nine awarded patents in the United States.  Our patents cover processes to break down plant biomass and a technology to convert carbon chain chemical structures.  We intend to develop, maintain and secure further intellectual property rights and pursue new patents to expand upon our current patent base.
 
We have acquired exclusive rights to patented technology in support of the development and commercialization of our products, and we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary technology in developing potential products.  We continue to place significant emphasis on securing global intellectual property rights and we are pursuing new patents to expand upon our strong foundation for commercializing products in development.
 
We have received, and may receive in the future, claims of infringement of other parties’ proprietary rights.  See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings”.  Infringement or other claims could be asserted or prosecuted against us in the future, which could harm our business.  Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, cause delays in the development of our products, or require us to develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing arrangements.  Such royalty or licensing arrangements, if required, may require us to license back our technology or may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
 
In 2018, in cooperation with a federally funded agency, we secured a grant from the California Energy Commission to optimize and demonstrate the effectiveness of ionic liquids technologies for breaking down biomass to produce SAF and renewable diesel fuel.  After completion of technology development and pilot testing, this technology may be applied to the Carbon Zero production plants to commercialize this technology by converting the below zero carbon feedstocks such as waste wood and agricultural waste and renewable energy such as solar, RNG, biogas into energy dense liquid renewable fuels. A patent was awarded for this technology for the production of below zero carbon renewable fuel.
 
In January 2021, a U.S. patent was awarded for our exclusively licensed technology for the production of below zero carbon renewable fuel. This license enabled us to launch the “Carbon Zero” production plants that are designed to convert below zero carbon feedstocks such as waste wood and agricultural waste and renewable energy such as solar, RNG, and biogas into energy dense liquid renewable fuels. These renewable fuels can be utilized in hybrid electric cars or other electric engines which may create a below zero carbon greenhouse gas footprint across the entire life cycle of the fuel based on the Argonne National Laboratory’s GREET model, the leading lifecycle analysis measurement tool.
 
Environmental and Regulatory Matters
 
California Ethanol and California Dairy Renewable Natural Gas – The final volumes requirements are set forth below and represent continued growth over historic levels. The final percentage standards meet or exceed the volume targets specified by Congress for total renewable fuel, biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuel. On June 3, 2022, the EPA finalized Renewable Fuel Volume Requirements for calendar years 2020, 2021, and 2022.  On December 1, 2022, the EPA proposed Renewable Fuel volume standards for 2023, 2024 and 2025.

We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and permit conditions, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the air, water and ground, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, and the health and safety of our employees.  These laws, regulations and permits may, from time to time, require us to incur significant capital costs.  These include, but are not limited to, testing and monitoring plant emissions, and where necessary, obtaining and maintaining mitigation processes to comply with regulations.  They may also require us to make operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment.  A significant violation of these laws, regulations, permits or license conditions could result in substantial fines, criminal sanctions, permit revocations and/or facility shutdowns.  In addition, environmental laws and regulations change over time, and any such changes, more vigorous enforcement policies or the discovery of currently unknown conditions may require substantial additional environmental expenditures.
 
We are also subject to potential liability for the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination at each of the properties that we own or operate and at off-site locations where we arrange for the disposal of hazardous wastes.  If significant contamination is identified at our properties in the future, costs to investigate and remediate this contamination as well as costs to investigate or remediate associated damage could be significant.  If any of these sites are subject to investigation and/or remediation requirements, we may be responsible under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”) or other environmental laws for all or part of the costs of such investigation and/or remediation, and for damage to natural resources.  We may also be subject to related claims by private parties alleging property damage or personal injury due to exposure to hazardous or other materials at or from such properties.  While costs to address contamination or related third-party claims could be significant, based upon currently available information, we are not aware of any such material contamination or third-party claims.  Based on our current assessment of the environmental and regulatory risks, we have not accrued any-amounts for environmental matters as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.  The ultimate costs of any liabilities that may be identified or the discovery of additional contaminants could materially adversely impact our results of operation or financial condition.
 
In addition, the production and transportation of our products may result in spills or releases of hazardous substances, which could result in claims from governmental authorities or third parties relating to actual or alleged personal injury, property damage, or damage to natural resources.  We maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses caused by our operations.  Our general and umbrella liability policy coverage includes, but is not limited to, physical damage to assets, employer’s liability, comprehensive general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation.  We do not carry environmental insurance.  We believe that our insurance is adequate for our industry, but losses could occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage.  The occurrence of events which result in significant personal injury or damage to our property, natural resources or third parties that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
 
Our air emissions are subject to the federal Clean Air Act, and similar state laws, which generally require us to obtain and maintain air emission permits for our ongoing operations as well as for any expansion of existing facilities or any new facilities.  Obtaining and maintaining those permits requires us to incur costs, and any future more stringent standards may result in increased costs and may limit or interfere with our operating flexibility.  These costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  Because other ethanol manufacturers in the U.S. are and will continue to be subject to similar laws and restrictions, we do not currently believe that our costs to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations will adversely affect our competitive position with other U.S. ethanol producers.  However, because ethanol is produced and traded internationally, these costs could adversely affect us in our efforts to compete with foreign producers who are not subject to such stringent requirements.

New laws or regulations relating to the production, disposal or emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases may require us to incur significant additional costs with respect to ethanol plants that we build or acquire.  We currently conduct our North American commercial activities exclusively in California. Climate change and reduction legislation is a topic of consideration by the U.S. Congress and California State Legislature, which may significantly impact the biofuels industry’s emissions regulations, as will the RFS, California’s LCFS, and other potentially significant changes in existing transportation fuels regulations.
 
India Biodiesel - We are subject to national, state and local environmental laws, regulations and permits, including with respect to the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, and the health and safety of our employees.  These laws may require us to make operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment.  A violation of these laws, regulations or permits can result in substantial fines, natural resource damages, criminal sanctions, permit revocations and/or facility shutdowns.  In addition, environmental laws and regulations (and interpretations thereof) change over time, and any such changes, more vigorous enforcement policies or the discovery of currently unknown conditions may require substantial additional environmental expenditures.
Employees
 
At December 31, 2022, we had a total of 168 employees, comprised of 17 full-time employees in our corporate offices, 39 full-time equivalent employees at the Keyes Plant, 11 full-time and 1 part-time Aemetis Biogas employees, 3 full-time employees at the Riverbank site, and 97 full-time equivalent employees in India.
 
We believe that our employees are highly skilled, and our success will depend in part upon our ability to retain our employees and attract new qualified employees, many of whom are in great demand. We have never had a work stoppage or strike, and no employees are presently represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe relations with our employees are positive.
