Item 1. Business
 Oxford Square Capital Corp. (“OXSQ,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). We have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) beginning with our 2003 taxable year. Our investment objective is to maximize our portfolio’s total return. Our primary current focus is to seek an attractive risk-adjusted total return by investing primarily in corporate debt securities and collateralized loan obligation (“CLO”) structured finance investments that own corporate debt securities. CLO investments may also include warehouse facilities, which are early-stage CLO vehicles intended to aggregate loans that may be used to form the basis of a traditional CLO vehicle. We may also invest in publicly traded debt and/or equity securities. As a BDC, we may not acquire any asset other than “qualifying assets” unless, at the time we make the acquisition, the value of our qualifying assets represents at least 70% of the value of our total assets.
 Our capital is generally used by our corporate borrowers to finance organic growth, acquisitions, recapitalizations and working capital. Our investment decisions are based on extensive analysis of potential portfolio companies’ business operations supported by an in-depth understanding of the quality of their recurring revenues and cash flow, variability of costs and the inherent value of their assets, including proprietary intangible assets and intellectual property. In making our CLO investments, we consider the indenture structure for that vehicle, its operating characteristics and compliance with its various indenture provisions, as well as its corporate loan-based collateral pool.
 We generally expect to invest between $5.0 million and $50.0 million in each of our portfolio investments, although this investment size may vary as the size of our capital base changes and market conditions warrant. We invest in both fixed and variable interest rate structures. We expect that our investment portfolio will be diversified among a large number of investments with few investments, if any, exceeding 5% of the total portfolio.
 The structures of our investments will vary and we seek to invest across a wide range of different industries. We seek to invest in entities that, as a general matter, have been operating for at least one year prior to the date of our investment and that will, at the time of our investment, have employees and revenues, and which are cash flow positive. Many of these companies are expected to have financial backing provided by other financial or strategic sponsors at the time we make an investment. The portfolio companies in which we invest, however, will generally be considered below investment grade, and their debt securities may in turn be referred to as “junk.” A portion of our investment portfolio may consist of debt investments for which issuers are not required to make significant principal payments until the maturity of the senior loans, which could result in a substantial loss to us if such issuers are unable to refinance or repay their debt at maturity. In addition, many of the debt securities we hold typically contain interest reset provisions that may make it more difficult for a borrower to repay the loan, heightening the risk that we may lose all or part of our investment.
 We also purchase portions of equity and junior debt tranches of CLO vehicles. Substantially all of the CLO vehicles in which we may invest would be deemed to be investment companies under the 1940 Act but for the exceptions set forth in section 3(c)(1) or section 3(c)(7). Other than CLO vehicles, we do not intend to invest, and we would be limited to 15% of our net assets if we did invest, in any types of entities that rely on the exceptions set forth in section 3(c)(1) or section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act. Structurally, CLO vehicles are entities that are formed to originate and or acquire a portfolio of loans. The loans within the CLO vehicle are limited to loans which meet established credit criteria and are subject to concentration limitations in order to limit a CLO vehicle’s exposure to a single credit. A CLO vehicle is formed by raising various classes or “tranches” of debt (with the most senior tranches being rated “AAA” to the most junior tranches typically being rated “BB” or “B”) and equity. The tranches of CLO vehicles rated “BB” or “B” may be referred to as “junk.” The equity of a CLO vehicle is generally required to absorb the CLO’s losses before any of the CLO’s other tranches, yet it also has the lowest level of payment priority among the CLO’s tranches; therefore, the equity is typically the riskiest of CLO investments which, if it were rated, may also be referred to as “junk.” We primarily focus on investing in the junior tranches and the equity of CLO vehicles. The CLO vehicles which we focus on are collateralized primarily by senior secured loans made to companies whose debt is unrated or is rated below investment grade, and generally 

1
  have very little or no direct exposure to real estate, mortgage loans or to pools of consumer-based debt, such as credit card receivables or auto loans. However, there can be no assurance that the collateral securing such senior secured loans would satisfy all of the unpaid principal and interest of our investment in the CLO vehicle in the event of default and the junior tranches, especially the equity tranches, of CLO vehicles are the last tranches to be paid, if at all, in the event of a default. Our investment strategy may also include warehouse facilities, which are early stage CLO vehicles intended to aggregate loans that may be used to form the basis of a traditional CLO vehicle.
 We have historically borrowed funds to make investments and may continue to do so. As a result, we are exposed to the risks of leverage, which may be considered a speculative investment technique. Borrowings, also known as leverage, magnify the potential for gain and loss on amounts invested and therefore increase the risks associated with investing in our securities. In addition, the costs associated with our borrowings, including any increase in the advisory fee payable to our investment adviser, Oxford Square Management, LLC (“Oxford Square Management”), will be borne by our common stockholders.

 MARKET OVERVIEW AND OPPORTUNITY
 The broader corporate loan and CLO equity markets were volatile in 2022. Significant weakness during the first half of 2022 was followed by a small improvement during the second half of 2022. During the first half of 2022, the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index decreased from a price of 98.64% at the end of December 2021 to 92.16% at the end of June 2022. During this period, lower credit quality loans underperformed higher credit quality loans. The S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index ended the year at a price of 92.44%, with lower credit quality loans continuing to underperform higher credit quality loans during the second half of 2022. For the full year, BB rated loan prices decreased 1.66%, B rated loan prices decreased 6.58%, and CCC rated loan prices decreased 19.01%. We believe that the loan market’s performance during 2022 was driven by macroeconomic uncertainty as well as significant investment outflows from the loan and CLO asset classes. Moreover, loan market credit quality deteriorated during 2022 as exhibited by an increase in default rates to 0.72% at the end of 2022 versus 0.29% at the end of 2021. This environment presented corporate loan and CLO managers with the opportunity to buy performing assets in the primary and secondary loan markets with sufficient risk adjusted returns, ultimately accruing to the benefit of loan and CLO investments. Additionally, as we execute our corporate loan strategy of focusing primarily on small to medium size broadly syndicated loans, narrowly syndicated loans and private deals, through purchases in both the primary and secondary markets, we remain mindful of maintaining overall portfolio liquidity. We believe this strategy allows us to maintain corporate debt investments which have sufficient liquidity in order to take advantage of market opportunities.

  COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES
 We believe that we are well positioned to provide financing to corporate borrowers and structured finance vehicles that, in turn, provide capital to corporate borrowers for the following reasons:
 •        Expertise in credit analysis and monitoring investments; and
 •        Established transaction sourcing network.
 Expertise in credit analysis and monitoring investments
 While our investment focus is on middle-market companies, we have invested, and in the future will likely continue to invest, in larger and smaller companies and in other investment structures on an opportunistic basis, including CLO investment vehicles. We believe our experience in analyzing middle-market companies and CLO investment structures, as detailed in the biographies of Oxford Square Management’s senior investment professionals, affords us a sustainable competitive advantage over lenders with limited experience in investing in these markets. In particular, we have expertise in evaluating the investment merits of middle-market companies as well as the structural features of CLO investments, and monitoring the credit risk of such investments after closing until full repayment.

  Established deal sourcing network
 Through the investment professionals of Oxford Square Management, we have extensive contacts and sources from which to generate investment opportunities. These contacts and sources include private equity funds, companies, brokers and bankers. We believe that senior professionals of Oxford Square Management have developed strong relationships within the investment community over their years within the banking, investment management and equity research fields.
 INVESTMENT PROCESS
 Identification
 We identify opportunities in the CLO market through our network of brokers, dealers, agent banks, collateral mangers and sponsors that we have worked with for several years. The CLO vehicles which we focus on are collateralized primarily by senior secured loans made to companies whose debt is unrated or is rated below investment grade, and generally have very little or no direct exposure to real estate, mortgage loans or to pools of consumer-based debt, such as credit card receivables or auto loans.
 We identify and source new prospective corporate debt investments through brokers, investment banks and direct company relationships. We have identified several criteria that we believe are important in seeking our investment objective. These criteria provide general guidelines for our investment decisions; however, we do not require each prospective investment to meet all or any specific number of these criteria.
 •        Experienced management.    We generally require that our portfolio companies have an experienced management team. We also prefer the portfolio companies to have in place proper incentives to induce management to succeed and to act in concert with our interests as investors, including having significant equity interests.
 •        Significant financial or strategic sponsor and/or strategic partner.    We prefer to invest in companies in which established private equity or venture capital funds or other financial or strategic sponsors have previously invested and are willing to make an ongoing contribution to the management of the business, including participation as board members or as business advisers.
 •        Strong competitive position in industry.    We seek to invest in companies that have developed a competitive position within their respective sector or niche of a specific industry.
 •        Profitable on a cash flow basis.    We focus on companies that are profitable or nearly profitable on an operating cash flow basis. Typically, we would not expect to invest in start-up companies.
 •        Clearly defined exit strategy.    Prior to making a direct corporate equity investment and/or an investment in a debt security that is accompanied by an equity-based security in a portfolio company, we analyze the potential for that company to increase the liquidity of its common equity through a future event that would enable us to realize appreciation, if any, in the value of our equity interest. Liquidity events may include an initial public offering, a merger or an acquisition of the company, a private sale of our equity interest to a third party, or a purchase of our equity position by the company or one of its stockholders.
 •        Liquidation value of assets.    Although we do not operate as an asset-based lender, the prospective liquidation value of the assets, if any, collateralizing the debt securities that we hold is a consideration in our credit analysis. We consider both tangible assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, and intangible assets, such as intellectual property, software code, customer lists, networks and databases.

  Due Diligence
 Our due diligence process generally includes some or all of the following elements:
 Corporate Loans
 Management team and financial sponsor
 •        management assessment including a review of management’s track record with respect to product development, sales and marketing, mergers and acquisitions, alliances, collaborations, research and development outsourcing and other strategic activities; and
 •        financial sponsor reputation, track record, experience and knowledge (where a financial sponsor is present in a transaction).
 Business
 •        industry and competitive analysis;
 •        assessment of likely exit strategies; and
 •        potential regulatory/legal issues.
 Financial condition
 •        detailed review of the historical financial performance and the quality of earnings;
 •        development of detailed pro forma financial projections; and
 •        review of assets and liabilities, including contingent liabilities.
 Structured Finance Vehicles
 •        review of indenture structures;
 •        review of underlying collateral loans;
 •        analysis of projected future cash flows; and
 •        analysis of compliance with covenants.
 Contemporaneous with our due diligence process, the investment team presents the investment proposal to our Investment Committee, which currently consists of Messrs. Cohen and Rosenthal. Our Investment Committee reviews and approves each of our portfolio investments.
Investment Characteristics
 In identifying corporate debt investments, we seek to ascertain the asset quality as well as the earnings quality of our prospective portfolio companies. Frequently, we obtain a senior secured position and thus receive a perfected, first or second priority security interest in substantially all of our portfolio companies’ assets, which entitles us to a preferred position on payments in the event of liquidation. It should be noted, however, that because we are not primarily an asset-based lender, in the current economic environment, the value of collateral and security interests may dissipate rapidly. In addition, in certain investments we seek loan covenants or to participate in syndicated loans that incorporate loan covenants that assist in the early identification of risk. Our loan documents may include affirmative covenants that require the portfolio company to take specific actions such as: periodic financial reporting; notification of material events and compliance with laws; restrictive covenants that prevent portfolio companies from taking a range of significant actions such as incurring additional indebtedness or making acquisitions without our consent; covenants requiring the portfolio company to maintain or achieve specified financial ratios such as debt to cash flow and interest coverage; and operating covenants requiring them to maintain certain operational benchmarks such as minimum revenue or minimum cash flow. Our loan documents also provide protection against customary events of default such as non-payment, breach of covenant, insolvency and change of control.

6
  In identifying CLO investments, we seek to ascertain the asset quality of the underlying collateral pool, the structural integrity of the CLO liability capital structure, the expected return profile of the CLO equity or debt tranche we are investing in, as well as the quality of the prospective collateral manager. The underlying portfolio of each CLO investment is typically diversified across approximately 100 to 250 broadly syndicated loans which are predominantly 1st lien senior secured term loans to U.S. corporations. Additionally, these collateral pools typically do not have direct exposure to real estate, mortgages, or consumer-based credit assets. Our investment focus is generally agnostic between the primary and secondary CLO markets. In both markets, we pursue opportunities which we view to have attractive optionality with regards to the ability to refinance or “reset” the CLO liability capital structure at some point in the future. A CLO “reset” typically includes an extension of the CLO’s reinvestment period in addition to the refinancing of the CLO liabilities. We continue to prefer CLO equity investments which have longer reinvestment periods which may give CLO managers additional time to rebuild collateral value from potential credit losses as well as take advantage of a potential disruption in the broader credit markets.
 MONITORING RELATIONSHIPS WITH PORTFOLIO COMPANIES
 Monitoring
 We monitor the financial trends of each portfolio company to assess the appropriate course of action for each investment and to evaluate overall portfolio quality. We closely monitor the status and performance of each individual company on at least a quarterly and, in some cases, a monthly basis.
 We have several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance of our investments, including but not limited to the following:
 •        assessment of business development success, and the portfolio company’s overall adherence to its business plan; and
 •        review of monthly and/or quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies.
 In addition, we may from time to time identify investments that require closer monitoring or become workout assets. In such cases, we will develop a strategy for workout assets and periodically gauge our progress against that strategy. As a private debt holder, we may incur losses from our investing activities from time to time; however, we attempt, where possible, to work with troubled portfolio companies in order to recover as much of our investments as is practicable.
 Portfolio Grading
 We have developed a credit grading system to monitor the quality of our debt investment portfolio. We use an investment rating scale of 1 to 5. The following table provides a description of the conditions associated with each debt investment. Equity securities, including CLO equity tranches, are not graded.


Grade | Summary Description 
------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 | Company is ahead of expectations and/or outperforming financial covenant requirements of the specific tranche and such trend is expected to continue. 
2 | Full repayment of the outstanding amount of OXSQ’s cost basis and interest is expected for the specific tranche. 
3 | Closer monitoring is required. Full repayment of the outstanding amount of OXSQ’s cost basis and interest is expected for the specific tranche. 
4 | A loss of interest income has occurred or is expected to occur and, in most cases, the investment is placed on non-accrual status. Full repayment of the outstanding amount of OXSQ’s cost basis is expected for the specific tranche.
5 | Full repayment of the outstanding amount of OXSQ’s cost basis is not expected for the specific tranche and the investment is placed on non-accrual status. 


7
  Significant Managerial Assistance
 As a BDC, we are required to offer significant managerial assistance to portfolio companies. This assistance, were it to be accepted, would typically involve monitoring the operations of portfolio companies, participating in their board and management meetings, consulting with and advising their officers and providing other organizational and financial guidance.
Portfolio Overview
 We seek to create a portfolio that includes primarily CLO investments, senior secured loans, senior subordinated and junior subordinated debt investments, as well as warrants and other equity instruments we may receive in connection with such debt investments. We generally expect to invest between $5 million and $50 million in each of our portfolio companies. We expect that our investment portfolio will be diversified among a large number of investments with few investments, if any, exceeding 5% of the total portfolio.
 The following is a representative list of the industries in which we have invested:
 
• Structured Finance | • IT Consulting

 INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT
 Management Services
 Oxford Square Management serves as our investment adviser. Oxford Square Management is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Subject to the overall supervision of our Board, Oxford Square Management manages our day-to-day operations and provides investment advisory services to us. Under the terms of our Investment Advisory Agreement with Oxford Square Management (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”), Oxford Square Management:
 •        determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes;
 •        identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make;
 •        closes, monitors and services the investments we make; and
 •        determines what securities we will purchase, retain or sell.
 Oxford Square Management’s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to us are not impaired. Oxford Square Management has agreed that, during the term of its Investment Advisory Agreement with us, it will not serve as investment adviser to any other public or private entity that utilizes a principal investment strategy of providing debt financing to middle-market companies similar to those we target.
 Advisory Fee
 General Terms
 We pay Oxford Square Management an advisory fee for its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement consisting of a base advisory fee (the “Base Fee”) and two types of incentive fees.
 The Base Fee is payable quarterly in arrears, calculated based on a percentage of the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately prorated for any partial quarter.
 The incentive fees are commonly referred to as the “income incentive fee” and the “capital gains incentive fee,” with the first fee payable quarterly in arrears and the second fee payable in arrears at the end of each calendar year.
 •        The first fee, which we refer to as the “Net Investment Income Incentive Fee,” is determined by reference to the Company’s “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” (as defined below). Given that this incentive fee is payable without regard to any gain, loss or unrealized depreciation that may occur during the quarter, Oxford Square Management’s incentive fee may be payable notwithstanding a decline in net asset value that quarter.
 •        The second fee, which we refer to as the “Capital Gains Incentive Fee,” equals 20% of our “Incentive Fee Capital Gains,” which consists of our realized capital gains for each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation for that calendar year. For accounting purposes under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), the Capital Gains Incentive Fee is based on a hypothetical liquidation of the Company. In such a calculation, in order to reflect the theoretical Capital Gains Incentive Fee that would have been payable for a given period as if all unrealized gains were realized, we will accrue a Capital Gains Incentive Fee based upon net realized gains and unrealized depreciation for that calendar year (in accordance with the terms of the Investment Advisory 

10
  Agreement), plus unrealized appreciation on investments held at the end of the period. It should be noted that a fee so calculated and accrued would not necessarily be payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement, and may never be paid based upon the computation of Capital Gains Incentive Fees in subsequent periods. Amounts paid under the Investment Advisory Agreement will be consistent with the formula in the Investment Advisory Agreement.
 The cost of both the Base Fee payable to Oxford Square Management and any incentive fees earned by Oxford Square Management are ultimately borne by our common stockholders.
 Calculation of Fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement and 2016 Fee Waiver
 The Investment Advisory Agreement specifies the calculation of the advisory fee payable thereunder, as described in greater detail below. However, Oxford Square Management unilaterally determined to waive, under certain circumstances, part of its total fees payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement, pursuant to a fee waiver letter effective April 1, 2016 (the “2016 Fee Waiver”).
 The Investment Advisory Agreement provides for a series of calculations to be used in determining the Base Fee and Net Investment Income Incentive Fee payable to Oxford Square Management. The 2016 Fee Waiver operates by providing for a second series of calculations to be run alongside the calculations of the Base Fee and Net Investment Income Incentive Fee under the Investment Advisory Agreement. In the event that the second set of calculations produces a higher combined Base Fee and Net Investment Income Incentive Fee for any quarterly period, those combined fees are set to the original (lower) level, calculated pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. In the event that the second set of calculations produces lower combined Base Fee and Net Investment Income Incentive Fee for that quarterly period, those lower combined fees are adopted for that quarterly period. In either case, the lower level of combined fees is used for that quarter, and, accordingly, the advisory fee payable to Oxford Square Management can only be reduced, and never increased, as a result of the 2016 Fee Waiver.
 Calculation of Fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement.    Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, and without applying the 2016 Fee Waiver, the total advisory fee would be calculated as follows:
 1)      Base Fee:    The Base Fee is calculated at an annual rate of 2.00% of our gross assets, and appropriately adjusted for any equity or debt capital raises, repurchases or redemptions during the current calendar quarter.
 2)      Net Investment Income Incentive Fee:    The Net Investment Income Incentive Fee is calculated based on our “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” for the immediately preceding calendar quarter.
 a.For this purpose, “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees, such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the Base Fee, expenses payable under our administration agreement, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest, and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation.
 b.      Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to one-fourth of an annual “hurdle rate.” The annual hurdle rate is determined as of the immediately preceding December 31st by adding 5.0% to the interest rate then payable on the most recently issued five-year U.S. Treasury Notes, up to a maximum annual hurdle rate of 10.0%. The annual hurdle rates for the 2022, 2021 and 2020 calendar years, calculated as of December 31, were approximately 6.26%, 5.36%, and 6.69%, respectively, under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement. Our net investment income (to the extent not distributed to our shareholders) used to calculate the Net Investment Income Incentive Fee was also included in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the 2.00% Base Fee.

11
  c.      The operation of the incentive fee with respect to our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for each quarter is as follows:
 i.       no incentive fee was payable to Oxford Square Management in any calendar quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income did not exceed one fourth of the annual hurdle rate (approximately 6.26% for the 2022 calendar year).
 ii.      20% of the amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds one-fourth of the annual hurdle rate (approximately 6.26% for the 2022 calendar year) in any calendar quarter was payable to Oxford Square Management (i.e., once the hurdle rate is reached, 20% of all Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income thereafter was allocated to Oxford Square Management).
 3)      Capital Gains Incentive Fee.    The “Capital Gains Incentive Fee,” is determined as described above.
 For more information about the calculation of the advisory fee under the Investment Advisory Agreement prior to effectiveness of the 2016 Fee Waiver, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.
 Calculation of Fees under the 2016 Fee Waiver.    Following the effectiveness of the 2016 Fee Waiver, a second set of calculations is applied each quarter, and, if (and only if) those calculations result in a lower total advisory fee (i.e., the combination of the Base Fee and any incentive fees), they are used to calculate the total advisory fee payable to Oxford Square Management for a particular quarter. No individual element of those calculations is applicable by itself — only the totality of those calculations is considered. Generally, and as described in greater detail below, under the second set of calculations provided for by the 2016 Fee Waiver:
 1)      Base Fee:
 a.      The calculation of the Base Fee component is reduced from 2.00% to 1.50%; and
 b.      No Base Fee is calculated on funds received in connection with any capital raises until the funds are invested.
 2)      Net Investment Income Incentive Fee:
 a.      The calculation of our Net Investment Income Incentive Fee is revised to include a Total Return Requirement (as defined below). Under the Total Return Requirement, we are only required to pay Oxford Square Management a Net Investment Income Incentive Fee if 20% of the “cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations” (as defined below) — during the calendar quarter for which such fees are being calculated and the eleven (11) preceding quarters — is greater than the cumulative Net Investment Income Incentive Fees accrued and/or paid over for the same period, even when our net investment income exceeds the minimum return to our stockholders required to be achieved before Oxford Square Management is entitled to receive a Net Investment Income Incentive Fee (which minimum return is commonly referred to as the “preferred return” or “hurdle rate”);
 b.      The calculation of our Net Investment Income Incentive Fee incorporates a “catch-up” provision that provides that Oxford Square Management will receive 100% of our net investment income with respect to that portion of such net investment income, if any, that exceeds the preferred return but is less than 2.1875% quarterly (8.75% annualized) and 20% of any net investment income thereafter; and
 c.      The hurdle rate used to calculate the Net Investment Income Incentive Fee is changed from a variable rate, based on the five-year U.S. Treasury note plus 5.00% (with a maximum of 10%), to a fixed rate of 7.00%.

12
  More specifically, for the purpose of calculating the amount of total advisory fees (if any) to be waived during a particular calendar quarter, the Base Fee and Net Investment Income Incentive Fee are calculated as follows under the 2016 Fee Waiver:
 1)      Base Fee:    The Base Fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.50%, adjusted pro rata for any share issuances, debt issuances, repurchases or redemptions during the current calendar quarter; provided, however, that no Base Fee is payable on the cash proceeds received by us in connection with any share or debt issuances until such proceeds have been invested in accordance with our investment objectives. The Base Fee for any partial month or quarter is pro-rated.
 2)      Net Investment Income Incentive Fee:    The Income Incentive Fee is calculated based on the amount by which (x) the “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” (as defined below) for the calendar quarter exceeds (y) the “Preferred Return Amount” (as defined below) for the calendar quarter.
 a.      A “Preferred Return Amount” is calculated on a quarterly basis by multiplying 1.75% by the Company’s net asset value at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter.
 b.      The Net Investment Income Incentive Fee is then calculated as follows:
 (i)     no Net Investment Income Incentive Fee is payable to Oxford Square Management in any calendar quarter in which the “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” does not exceed the “Preferred Return Amount”;
 (ii)    100% of the “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” for such quarter, if any, that exceeds the “Preferred Return Amount” but is less than or equal to a “Catch-Up Amount” determined on a quarterly basis by multiplying 2.1875% by OXSQ’s net asset value at the end of such calendar quarter; and
 (iii)   for any quarter in which the “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” exceeds the “Catch-Up Amount,” the Net Investment Income Incentive Fee will be calculated at the rate of 20% of the amount of the “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” for such quarter.
 c.      There is no accumulation of amounts from quarter to quarter for the “Preferred Return Amount,” and accordingly there is no claw back of amounts previously paid to Oxford Square Management if the “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” for subsequent quarters is below the quarterly “Preferred Return Amount”.
 d.      The calculation of the Company’s Net Investment Income Incentive Fee is subject to a total return requirement (the “Total Return Requirement”) that provides that a Net Investment Income Incentive Fee will not be payable to Oxford Square Management except to the extent 20% of the “cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations” (which is the amount, if positive, of the sum of the “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income,” realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation) during the calendar quarter for which such fees are being calculated and the eleven (11) preceding quarters exceeds the cumulative Net Investment Income Incentive Fees accrued and/or paid for such eleven (11) preceding quarters.
 3)      Capital Gains Incentive Fee.    The second part of the incentive fee, the “Capital Gains Incentive Fee,” is determined as described above.
 Example 1: Net Investment Income Portion of Incentive Fee for Each Calendar Quarter (applying 2016 Fee Waiver)
 Hypothetical Scenario 1
 Quarterly Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.25%
 Quarterly Hurdle rate = 1.75%
 Base Fee(1) = 0.375%
 Quarterly Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.2%

13
  Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (investment income – (Base Fee + other expenses)) = 0.675%
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed hurdle rate, therefore there is no income-related incentive fee.
 Hypothetical Scenario 2
 Quarterly Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2.50%
 Quarterly Hurdle rate = 1.75%
 Base Fee(1) = 0.375%
 Quarterly Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.2%
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (investment income – (Base Fee + other expenses)) = 1.925%
 The Total Return Requirement is met (no Net Investment Income Incentive Fee would be payable if the Total Return Requirement were not met).
 Incentive fee = 100%* Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in excess of the hurdle rate but less than 2.1875% and 20% of any Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income thereafter.
 = 100%* (1.925% – 1.75%)
 = 100%* 0.175%
 = 0.175%
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.1875%. Therefore the income-related incentive fee is 0.175%.
 Hypothetical Scenario 3
 Quarterly Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 4.00%
 Quarterly Hurdle rate = 1.75%
 Base Fee(1) = 0.375%
 Quarterly Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.2%
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (investment income – (Base Fee + other expenses)) = 3.425%
 The Total Return Requirement is met (no Net Investment Income Incentive Fee would be payable if the Total Return Requirement were not met).
 Incentive fee = 100% * Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in excess of the hurdle rate but less than 2.1875% and 20% of any Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income thereafter.
 = 100%* (2.1875% – 1.75%) + 20%* (3.425% – 2.1875%)
 = 100%* 0.4375% + 20%* 1.2375%
 = 0.4375% + 0.2475%
 = 0.685%
 Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds the hurdle rate and 2.1875%. Therefore the income-related incentive fee is 0.685%.

  Example 2: Capital Gains Portion of Incentive Fee (*)
 Capital Gains Incentive Fee = 20% × Incentive Fee Capital Gains (i.e., our realized capital gains for each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation for that calendar year).
Hypothetical Scenarios:
 •        Year 1 = no realized capital gains or losses
 •        Year 2 = 9% realized capital gains, 0% realized capital losses, 1% unrealized depreciation and 0% unrealized appreciation
 •        Year 3 = 12% realized capital gains, 0% realized capital losses, 2% unrealized depreciation and 2% unrealized appreciation
 
Year 1 incentive fee | • Total Incentive Fee Capital Gains = 0 
---------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | • No Capital Gains Incentive Fee paid to Oxford Square Management in Year 1 
Year 2 incentive fee | • Total Incentive Fee Capital Gains = 8% 
 | (9% realized capital gains less 1% unrealized depreciation) 
 | • Total Capital Gains Incentive Fee paid to Oxford Square Management in Year 2 
 | = 20% × 8% 
 | = 1.6% 
Year 3 incentive fee | • Total Incentive Fee Capital Gains = 10% 
 | (12% realized capital gains less 2% unrealized depreciation; unrealized appreciation has no effect)
 | • Total Capital Gains Incentive Fee paid to Oxford Square Management in Year 3 
 | = 20% × 10% 
 | = 2%

 Summary Risk Factors
 The risk factors described below are a summary of the principal risk factors associated with an investment in us. These are not the only risks we face. You should carefully consider these risk factors, together with the risk factors set forth in Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other reports and documents filed by us with the SEC.
Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure
 •        Any failure on our part to maintain our status as a business development company would reduce our operating flexibility, including our ability to borrow money.
 •        We are dependent upon Oxford Square Management’s key management personnel for our future success, particularly Jonathan H. Cohen and Saul B. Rosenthal.
 •        Our financial condition and results of operations will depend on our ability to manage our existing portfolio and future growth effectively.
 •        Our business and operation could be negatively affected if we become subject to any securities litigation or shareholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of our investment strategy and impact our stock price.
 •        We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities.

17
  •        Our business model depends to a significant extent upon strong referral relationships with financial sponsors, and the inability of the senior investment professionals of our investment adviser to maintain or develop these relationships, or the failure of these relationships to generate investment opportunities, could adversely affect our business.
 •        There will be uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments, which may impact our net asset value.
 •        Further downgrades of the U.S. credit rating, impending automatic spending cuts or another government shutdown could negatively impact our liquidity, financial condition and earnings.
 •        Our business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance, public disclosure and accounting requirements that could adversely affect our business and financial results.
 •        The interest rates of our term loans to our portfolio companies that extend beyond 2021 might be subject to change based on recent regulatory changes.
 •        A disruption in the capital markets and the credit markets could negatively affect our business.
 •        We are permitted to borrow money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us.
 •        Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we raise additional capital, which may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage.
 •        Our Board of Directors is authorized to reclassify any unissued shares of common stock into one or more classes of preferred stock, which could convey special rights and privileges to its owners.
 •        Our ability to enter into transactions involving derivatives and financial commitment transactions may be limited.
 •        There are significant potential conflicts of interest between OXSQ and our management team.
 •        Our Board of Directors may change our investment objective, operating policies and strategies without prior notice or stockholder approval.
 Risks Related to U.S. Federal Tax Regulation
 •        We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates, if we are unable to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Risks Relating to Our Investments
 •        Our investment portfolio may be concentrated in a limited number of portfolio companies, which will subject us to a risk of significant loss if any of these companies defaults on its obligations under any of its debt securities that we hold or if the sectors in which we invest experience a market downturn.
 •        The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business.
 •        If we cannot obtain additional capital because of either regulatory or market price constraints, we could be forced to curtail or cease our new lending and investment activities, our net asset value could decrease and our level of distributions and liquidity could be affected adversely.
 •        Our investments in the companies that we target may be extremely risky and we could lose all or part of our investments.
 •        Our incentive fee may induce Oxford Square Management to use leverage and to make speculative investments.
 •        Our portfolio companies may incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, our investments in such companies.
 •        Our investments in CLO vehicles are riskier and less transparent to us and our stockholders than direct investments in the underlying senior loans.

18
  Risks Relating to an Investment in Our Securities
 •        Our common stock price may be volatile.
 •        Our shares of common stock have traded at a discount from net asset value and may do so in the future.
 •        There is a risk that investors in our equity securities will not receive distributions or that our distributions will not grow over time and a portion of our distributions could be a return of capital.
 •        We may choose to pay distributions in our own common stock, in which case, our stockholders may be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes in excess of the cash distributions they receive.]
 Risks Relating to the Economy
 •        The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe disruptions in the U.S. economy and has disrupted financial activity in the areas in which we or our portfolio companies operate.
 •        We are currently operating in a period of capital markets disruption and economic uncertainty.
 •        Political, social and economic uncertainty, including uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic, creates and exacerbates risks.
 COMPETITION
 Our primary competitors to provide financing to primarily non-public companies include private equity and venture capital funds, other equity and non-equity based investment funds, including other BDCs, and investment banks and other sources of financing, including traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks and specialty finance companies. Many of these entities may have greater financial and managerial resources than we have. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure — We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities.”
EMPLOYEES
 We have no employees. Our day-to-day investment operations are managed by Oxford Square Management. In addition, we reimburse Oxford Funds for an allocable portion of expenses incurred by it on our behalf under the Administration Agreement, including a portion of the rent and the compensation of our Chief Financial Officer, accounting staff and other administrative support personnel. We will also pay the costs associated with the functions performed by our Chief Compliance Officer under the terms of an agreement between the Company and ACA Group.
CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS
 As a BDC, we have elected to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, beginning with our 2003 taxable year. As a RIC, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To continue to qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, to qualify for RIC tax treatment we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our “investment company taxable income,” which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses (the “Annual Distribution Requirement”).
 Taxation as a RIC
 If we qualify as a RIC; and satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, then we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain (i.e., realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) we timely distribute to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gains not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders.

19
  We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income and net capital gain that we recognized in preceding years but were not distributed in such years, and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax (the “Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement”). We generally will endeavor in each taxable year to make sufficient distributions to our stockholders to satisfy the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement.
 In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:
 •        at all times during each taxable year, be registered under the 1940 Act as a management company or unit investment trust, or have in effect an election under the 1940 Act to be treated as a BDC;
 •        derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to loans of certain securities, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, net income from certain “qualified publicly traded partnerships,” or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities (the “90% Income Test”); and
 •        diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:
 •        at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and
 •        no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in (i) the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer (ii) the securities, other than securities of other RICs, of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses; or (iii) the securities of certain “qualified publicly traded partnerships” (the “Diversification Tests”).
 We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as PIK interest and deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock. Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. In addition, we may be required to accrue for U.S. federal income tax purposes amounts attributable to our investment in CLOs that may differ from the distributions received in respect of such investments. Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds, to sell assets and to make taxable distributions of our stock and debt securities in order to satisfy distribution requirements. Our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. If we are unable to obtain cash from other sources to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we may fail to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC and become subject to tax as a corporation.
 Under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain “asset coverage” tests are met. If we are prohibited to make distributions, we may fail to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC and become subject to tax as an ordinary corporation.

20
  We have purchased and may in the future purchase residual or subordinated interests in CLOs that are treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as shares in a “passive foreign investment company” or a PFIC. We may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our allocable share of a portion of any “excess distribution” received on, or any gain from the disposition of, such shares. Additional charges, in the nature of interest, generally will be imposed on us in respect of deferred taxes arising from any such excess distribution or gain. This additional tax and interest may apply even if we make a distribution in an amount equal to any “excess distribution” or gain from the disposition of such shares as a taxable dividend by us to our shareholders. If we elect to treat a PFIC as a “qualified electing fund” under the Code (a “QEF”), in lieu of the foregoing requirements, we will be required to include in income each year our proportionate share of the ordinary earnings and net capital gain of the QEF, even if such income is not distributed by the QEF. Alternatively, we may be able to elect to mark-to-market at the end of each taxable year our shares in a PFIC; in this case, we will recognize as ordinary income our allocable share of any increase in the value of such shares, and as ordinary loss our allocable share of any decrease in such value to the extent that any such decrease does not exceed prior increases included in our income. Under either election, we may be required to recognize in a year income in excess of distributions from PFICs and proceeds from dispositions of PFIC shares during that year, and such income will nevertheless be subject to the Annual Distribution Requirement and will be taken into account for purposes of the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement.
 If we hold more than 10% of the shares in a foreign corporation that is treated as a controlled foreign corporation or a CFC (including equity tranche investments in a CLO treated as a CFC), we may be treated as receiving a deemed distribution (taxable as ordinary income) each year from such foreign corporation in an amount equal to our pro rata share of the corporation’s income for the tax year (including both ordinary earnings and capital gains), whether or not the corporation makes an actual distribution during such year. This deemed distribution is required to be included in the income of a U.S. Stockholder (as defined below) of a CFC regardless of whether the stockholder has made a QEF election with respect to such CFC. In general, a foreign corporation will be classified as a CFC if more than 50% of the shares of the corporation, measured by reference to combined voting power or value, is owned (directly, indirectly or by attribution) by U.S. Stockholders. A “U.S. Stockholder,” for this purpose, is any U.S. person that possesses (actually or constructively) 10% or more of the combined voting power or value of all classes of shares of a corporation. If we are treated as receiving a deemed distribution from a CFC, we will be required to include such distribution in our investment company taxable income regardless of whether we receive any actual distributions from such CFC, and we must distribute such income to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement and the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement.
 Income inclusions from a QEF or a CFC will be “good income” for purposes of the 90% Income Test provided that they are derived in connection with our business of investing in stocks and securities or the QEF or the CFC distribute such income to us in the same taxable year to which the income is included in our income.
 Failure to Qualify as a RIC
 If we were unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC, and certain cure provisions are not met, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates, regardless of whether we make any distributions to our stockholders. Distributions would not be required, and any distributions made would be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income that, subject to certain limitations, may be eligible for the 20.0% maximum rate to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits provided certain holding period and other requirements were met. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder’s adjusted tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. To requalify as a RIC in a subsequent taxable year, we would be required to satisfy the RIC qualification requirements for that year and dispose of any earnings and profits from any year in which we failed to qualify as a RIC. Subject to a limited exception applicable to RICs that qualified as such under the Code for at least one year prior to disqualification and that requalify as a RIC no later than the second year following the nonqualifying year, we would be subject to tax on any unrealized net built-in gains in the assets held by us during the period in which we failed to qualify as a RIC that are recognized within the subsequent 5 years, unless we made a special election to pay U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates on such built-in gains at the time of our requalification as a RIC.

  REGULATION AS A BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT COMPANY
 General
 A BDC is regulated by the 1940 Act. A BDC must be organized in the United States for the purpose of investing in or lending to primarily private companies and making managerial assistance available to them. A BDC may use capital provided by public stockholders and from other sources to invest in long-term, private investments in businesses. A BDC provides stockholders the ability to retain the liquidity of a publicly traded stock, while sharing in the possible benefits, if any, of investing in primarily privately owned companies.
 We may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC unless authorized by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities, as required by the 1940 Act. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of: (i) 67% or more of such company’s voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company. We currently do not anticipate any substantial change in the nature of our business.
 As with other companies regulated by the 1940 Act, a BDC must adhere to certain substantive regulatory requirements. A majority of our directors must be persons who are not “interested persons,” as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) the 1940 Act. Additionally, we are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect the BDC. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to the company or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.
 As a BDC, we are required to meet a coverage ratio of the value of total assets to total senior securities, which includes all of our borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future. On April 6, 2018, the Board, including a “required majority” (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the Board, approved the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. As a result, our asset coverage requirement under the 1940 Act for senior securities was changed from 200% to 150%, effective as of April 6, 2019. In other words, under the 1940 Act, we are able to borrow $2 for investment purposes for every $1 of investor equity. We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC.
 We are not generally able to sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. Refer to “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to our Business and Structure — Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we raise additional capital, which may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage.” We may, however, sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share (i) in connection with a rights offering to our existing stockholders, (ii) with the consent of the majority of our common stockholders, or (iii) under such other circumstances as the SEC may permit. For example, we may sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then current net asset value of our common stock if our Board determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve our policy and practice of making such sales. In any such case, under such circumstances, the price at which our common stock is to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our Board, closely approximates the market value of such common stock. In addition, we may generally issue new shares of our common stock at a price below the net asset value in rights offerings to existing stockholders, in payment of distributions and in certain other limited circumstances
 We may be examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act.
 As a BDC, we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to our Business and Structure.”

22
  Qualifying Assets
 As a BDC, we may not acquire any asset other than “qualifying assets” unless, at the time we make the acquisition, the value of our qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the value of our total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are:
 •        securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering, the issuer of which is an eligible portfolio company;
 •        securities received in exchange for or distributed with respect to securities described in the bullet above or pursuant to the exercise of options, warrants or rights relating to such securities; and
 •        cash, cash items, government securities or high quality debt securities (within the meaning of the 1940 Act), maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.
 An eligible portfolio company is generally a domestic company that is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by a BDC) and that:
 •        does not have a class of securities with respect to which a broker may extend margin credit at the time the acquisition is made;
 •        is controlled by the BDC and has an affiliate of the BDC on its board of directors;
 •        does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange;
 •        is a public company that lists its securities on a national securities exchange with a market capitalization of less than $250 million; or
 •        meets such other criteria as may be established by the SEC.
 Control, as defined by the 1940 Act, is presumed to exist where a BDC beneficially owns more than 25% of the outstanding voting securities of the portfolio company.
 In addition, a BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in eligible portfolio companies, or in other securities that are consistent with its purpose as a BDC.
 Significant Managerial Assistance
 BDCs generally must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities significant managerial assistance, except in circumstances where either (i) the BDC controls such issuer of securities or (ii) the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together and one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. The Administrator or its affiliate provides such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance.
Code of Ethics and Insider Trading Policy
 As required by the 1940 Act, we maintain a Code of Ethics and Insider Trading Policy, or “Code of Ethics,” that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain transactions by our personnel. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to our Business and Structure — There are significant potential conflicts of interest between OXSQ and our management team.” Our Code of Ethics generally does not permit investments by our employees in securities that may be purchased or held by us. The Code of Ethics is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov. You may obtain copies of the Code of Ethics, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following email address: publicinfo@sec.gov. Our Code of Ethics is also available on our website at http://oxfordsquarecapital.com/.

  Compliance Policies and Procedures
 We and Oxford Square Management have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws, and are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation, and to designate a Chief Compliance Officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures.
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example:
 •        pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the “Exchange Act”), our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports;
 •        pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures;
 •        pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our management must prepare a report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; and
 •        pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.
 Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
 We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to our investment adviser, Oxford Square Management. The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of Oxford Square Management are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by Oxford Square Management, and, accordingly, are subject to change.
Introduction
 As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, Oxford Square Management has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, Oxford Square Management recognizes that it must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of its clients.
 These policies and procedures for voting proxies for Oxford Square Management’s investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act.
 Proxy Policies
 Oxford Square Management will vote proxies relating to our portfolio securities in the best interests of our stockholders. Oxford Square Management will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by us. Although Oxford Square Management will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on our portfolio securities, it may vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so. Oxford Square Management will abstain from voting only in unusual circumstances and where there is a compelling reason to do so.
 The proxy voting decisions of Oxford Square Management are made by the senior officers of Oxford Square Management who are responsible for monitoring each of our investments. To ensure that its vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, Oxford Square Management requires that: (i) anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to Oxford Square Management’s Chief Compliance Officer any potential conflict that he or she is 

24
  aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (ii) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how Oxford Square Management intends to vote on a proposal without the prior approval of the Chief Compliance Officer and senior management in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties.
