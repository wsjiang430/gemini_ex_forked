 Overview
We are a medical technology company with the goal of advancing the standard of care for the surgical management of bunion and related midfoot deformities. We have pioneered our proprietary Lapiplasty® 3D Bunion Correction System—a combination of instruments, implants and surgical methods designed to surgically correct all three planes of the bunion deformity. Although bunions are deformities typically caused by an unstable joint in the middle of the foot that leads to a three-dimensional ("3D") misalignment in the foot’s anatomical structure, the majority of traditional surgical approaches focus on correcting the deformity from a two-dimensional ("2D") perspective and therefore fail to address the root cause of the disorder. To effectively restore the normal anatomy of bunion patients and improve clinical outcomes, we believe addressing the root cause of the bunion is critical and have developed the Lapiplasty System to correct the deformity across all three anatomic dimensions. To provide a solution that also addresses midfoot deformities, in 2021, we launched our Adductoplasty® System, which brings together our implants and precision instrumentation for the first comprehensive system designed for reproducible realignment, stabilization, and fusion of the midfoot. Our mission is to be the leader in the surgical treatment of bunions by establishing the Lapiplasty System as the standard of care.
A bunion is a painful, disfiguring deformity characterized by a deviated position of the great toe, and easily identified visually by the "bump" at its base. Bunions affect approximately 65 million Americans, and generally increase in prevalence and severity over time. Nearly 25% of adults between the ages of 18 and 65, and over 35% of people over the age of 65, have bunions. Approximately 4.4 million patients in the United States seek medical attention for bunions annually; of these patients, an estimated 1.1 million are deemed surgical candidates, which represents a total annual addressable market opportunity of more than $5 billion. This large patient population often suffers from symptoms that worsen over time, including severe and debilitating pain, emotional burden and limited mobility, and is susceptible to further degeneration and common concomitant pathologies. Despite the significant limitations of traditional surgical treatment approaches, approximately 450,000 surgical bunion procedures are performed in the United States every year. We believe there is a significant opportunity to convert these to our Lapiplasty Procedure, representing a greater than $2.3 billion market opportunity. In addition, through better clinical outcomes and effective patient education, we believe we can increase the number of patients who seek surgical treatment, representing the incremental opportunity of $3 billion. The chart below illustrates our annual addressable U.S. market opportunity:

 The goal of bunion surgery is to restore the normal anatomy of patients in order to return natural function and appearance in the foot and relieve pain. A common misconception is that a bunion is simply an overgrowth of bone that can be shaved off. In reality, a bunion is a complex 3D deformity caused by an unstable joint in the middle of the foot (which we may refer to as the “root cause”) which causes the metatarsal bone in the foot to rotate out of alignment in all three anatomic dimensions. A 2015 study indicates that 87% of bunions have a 3D, rotational issue in addition to horizontal and vertical misalignments of the metatarsal bone. Traditional 2D approaches to bunion surgery, used in the majority of bunion surgical procedures, fail to correct this third “rotational” dimension of the bunion deformity, which has been reported to result in a 10 to 12 times increase in the chance of bunion recurrence as compared to 3D surgeries.
Historically, there have been two primary approaches to the surgical treatment of bunions, which inconsistently met patient needs and physician expectations. The first and most common approach is 2D Osteotomy surgery, which merely cuts and shifts the metatarsal bone in two dimensions, addressing the cosmetic bump rather than the root cause, which may result in high variability in

potential for bunion recurrence with long-term recurrence rates (up to 78%) and low patient satisfaction with the procedure. The second approach, traditionally reserved for the most advanced and severe bunion pathology is Lapidus Fusion surgery, which fuses the unstable joint but requires a technically challenging correction through a "freehand" technique which often results in inconsistent outcomes and has been reported to involve a protracted period of recovery, including approximately 6 to 8 weeks of non-weight-bearing. The freehand technique is highly dependent on the surgeon’s skill and requires the physician to perform complex corrections without the benefits of assistive instrumentation that are standard in many other orthopaedic joint procedures and, consequently, this surgery often results in inconsistent outcomes.
     
We believe our proprietary Lapiplasty System, the first of its kind, is the leading system designed to consistently and reliably correct all three dimensions of the bunion deformity, address the root cause of the bunion deformity, and allow return to weight-bearing quickly in a post-operative boot with low risk of recurrence (as described in more detail below in the section entitled "Key Clinical Advantages of the Lapiplasty System"). The Lapiplasty System combines our novel surgical approach, the Lapiplasty Procedure, with our procedural instrumentation and single-use implant kits. With help from our procedural instrumentation, the Lapiplasty Procedure is designed to rotate the entire metatarsal bone into normal anatomical position in all three dimensions, eliminating the bump and restoring normal anatomy. The unstable foundation in the foot is then secured with our titanium fixation plates and screws, allowing patients to get back on their feet quickly in a post-operative boot. The Lapiplasty Procedure can be performed in either hospital outpatient or ambulatory surgery center settings, and utilizes existing, well-established reimbursement codes. Since receiving 510(k) clearance for the Lapiplasty System in March 2015, more than 65,000 Lapiplasty Procedures have been performed in the United States.
The safety, effectiveness and clinical advantages of the Lapiplasty System have been demonstrated in multiple post-market clinical outcome studies. We believe this portfolio of studies is unique in the bunion correction field where comprehensive outcome studies with respect to marketed bunion correction surgical products are limited. Multiple peer-reviewed publications have demonstrated the ability of the Lapiplasty System to reproducibly correct all three dimensions of the deformity and allow the patient to quickly return to weight-bearing in a post-operative boot while exhibiting a low rate of bunion recurrence (as described in more detail below in the section entitled "Key Clinical Advantages of the Lapiplasty System"). We have completed enrollment in our ALIGN3D prospective, multicenter study, which is prospectively evaluating bunion correction status through five years after the Lapiplasty Procedure and includes patient satisfaction scoring, range of motion results and radiographic outcomes. Interim analyses from the ALIGN3D clinical study have been published in the Journal of Foot & Ankle Surgery and most recently presented at industry conferences, including at the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society ("AOFAS") Annual Meeting in September 2022, and at the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons ("ACFAS") Annual Scientific Conference that was held in early February 2023.


To broaden our Lapiplasty offerings, we launched the Lapiplasty Mini-Incision System in 2021, which is designed to allow the Lapiplasty Procedure to be performed through a 3.5cm incision as compared to the 6cm to 8cm incision with the standard Lapiplasty Procedure. To address midfoot deformities, which may occur in up to 30% of bunion patients, also in 2021, we launched the Adductoplasty System, which brings together our implants and precision instrumentation for the first comprehensive system designed for reproducible realignment, stabilization, and fusion of the midfoot. Other new product developments in 2022 include the Lapiplasty 3-n-1 Guide, the Lapiplasty S4A Anatomic Plating Kit, and the SpeedRelease and TriTome Release Instruments. In 2022, we previewed our next generation Micro-Lapiplasty Minimally Invasive System, which is designed to allow the deformity correction and joint preparation steps of the Lapiplasty Procedure to be performed through 2cm incisions and the SpeedPlate Rapid Compression Implant System designed for rapid delivery of titanium compression implants through small incisions. Commercial release of the Micro-Lapiplasty instrumentation and SpeedPlate implants is expected in the second half of 2023. We believe these new technologies demonstrate our commitment to rapid innovation with a focus on continually iterating the Lapiplasty System with options for reduced incision size and increased procedural efficiency.
 We market and sell our products in the United States primarily through a direct employee sales force that is supplemented by independent sales agencies across 193 territories focused on supporting adoption and utilization of the Lapiplasty System among the approximately 7,400 surgical podiatrists and 2,600 orthopaedic surgeons with foot and ankle specializations in the United States. To improve clinical outcomes, we devote significant resources to training and educating physicians on the safe and effective use of the Lapiplasty System. Additionally, we have developed a differentiated direct-to-patient outreach program that educates patients on the benefits of the Lapiplasty System. We also offer a "Find a Doctor" tool on our website that allows potential patients to search for experienced Lapiplasty surgeons in their local markets. We believe our patient and surgeon education programs and specialized teams supporting surgeons in the field combined with the Lapiplasty System’s differentiated clinical outcomes lead to an increase in utilization of the Lapiplasty System per physician over time.
Our internal employee engineering personnel and our Surgeon Advisory Board help us to generate ideas and develop product innovations. Our Surgeon Advisory Board is comprised of both podiatrists and orthopaedic foot and ankle surgeons who provide us with holistic insights for developing products that fully meet the needs of each group. Our research and development team is focused on improving clinical outcomes by designing new procedure-specific instruments and products and by developing enhanced surgical techniques.
We have experienced considerable growth since receiving 510(k) clearance for the Lapiplasty System in March 2015. The number of Lapiplasty Procedure Kits sold increased from 11,113 in 2020 to 17,490 in 2021 to 24,656 in 2022, representing a compound annual growth rate of 49.0%, despite the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on elective procedures in 2020 and 2021. Correspondingly, our revenue increased from $57.4 million in 2020 to $141.8 million in 2022, representing a compound annual growth rate of 57.2%.

Overview of Bunions
Hallux Valgus (commonly known as "bunions") is a painful, disfiguring deformity characterized by a deviated position of the great toe. Bunions are easily identified visually by the “bump” on the joint at the base of the great toe (the metatarsophalangeal ("MTP") joint). While this “bump” is widely considered to be the source of pain in bunion sufferers, a structural defect causing misalignment in the middle of the foot is the root cause of the deformity.
Bunion deformities are most commonly considered to be the consequence of a hereditary predisposition. Prevalence increases with age, and one study found that 70% of bunion sufferers are female, and that the disorder occurs in both feet, or bilaterally, in 56% of bunion sufferers. Bunions are progressive deformities, with symptoms that typically grow in severity over time. For those with predispositions for developing bunions, constrained footwear, weight-bearing activities or occupations that aggravate the condition may accelerate progression of the joint deformity and cause symptoms to appear earlier in life. If left untreated, bunions can often have a significant long-term negative impact on sufferers, including:
•Severe and debilitating pain in the bunion “bump” at the base of the great toe that can also develop in the ball of the foot. 
 •Quality of life deterioration with limited mobility, restrictions on footwear and an inability to participate in physical activities. 
 •Susceptibility to additional pathologies, such as hammertoes and arthritis of the great toe joint. 
 •Increased risk of injury as decreased stability leads to greater potential for falls. 
 •Emotional burden from becoming increasingly self-conscious about the bunions’ unsightly appearance. 


A common misconception is that a bunion is simply an overgrowth of bone that can be shaved off. Bunions are in reality complex 3D deformities caused by an unstable joint in the middle of the foot (the first tarsometatarsal ("TMT") joint) which allows the metatarsal bone to drift out of alignment in three anatomic dimensions. These three anatomic dimensions and their associated misalignments are summarized below:
•Dimension 1–Transverse Plane: a horizontal misalignment, in which the metatarsal bone leans sideways causing the “bump.” 
 •Dimension 2–Sagittal Plane: a vertical misalignment, in which the metatarsal bone can elevate, transferring excessive pressure to other toes and ball of the foot. 
 •Dimension 3–Frontal Plane: a rotational misalignment, in which the metatarsal bone rotates causing abnormal wear on the great toe joint. 
 The shift in the metatarsal bone causes bone or tissue at the MTP joint to move out of place, resulting in the visual “bump” associated with bunions.



Complex 3D Deformity More than a simple bump of bone& Unstable joint in midfoot allows metatarsal bone to drift out of alignment in all 3 anatomic dimensions Transverse Plane Metatarsal leans sideways causing the bump. Sagittal plane Metatarsal elevates up, transferring pressure to lesser metatarsals. Frontal Plane Metatarsal rotates causing abnormal wear on MTP great toe joint.
Traditional treatment options for bunion patients vary with the type and severity of each bunion. During the early stages of the disorder, pain can be managed but will typically worsen and additional symptoms may develop. The primary goal of most early treatment options is to relieve pressure on the bunion and halt the progression of the deformity. A physician may initially recommend various non-surgical treatments, including toe spacers, pads or splints, inserts or orthotics, medication or physical therapy. These options are prescribed to alleviate symptoms but do not address the root cause of the deformity. When these non-surgical treatments fail, or when the severity of the bunion deformity progresses past the threshold for such options, surgery is often necessary.
Limitations of Traditional Surgical Treatment Approaches
Historically, there have been two primary surgical approaches to bunion treatment, 2D Osteotomy and Lapidus Fusion. Between the two, approximately 450,000 bunion procedures are performed annually in the United States, of which approximately 75% are 2D Osteotomy procedures and approximately 25% are Lapidus Fusion procedures.

These traditional surgical treatment approaches are characterized by a 6% to 35% patient dissatisfaction rate for 2D Osteotomy surgery and a 7% to 13% dissatisfaction rate for Lapidus Fusion following surgery. Clinical literature has identified the primary patient expectations for bunion surgery to be pain relief, shoe fit, mobility and improvement in cosmetic appearance. Certain published long-term clinical studies have demonstrated complication rates as high as 78% following 2D Osteotomy surgery and 38% following Lapidus Fusion surgery, with deformity recurrence being among the most common complications in each. While not all patients with recurrence require a secondary surgical procedure, this high variability for potential recurrence relative to other common surgical procedures is a contributor to patient dissatisfaction.
2D Osteotomy
In a 2D Osteotomy, the bunion “bump” is shaved off and the metatarsal bone of the great toe is cut in half and shifted over to reduce the appearance of the bunion. However, by failing to address the root cause of the disorder and not correcting the deformity in all three dimensions, there is an increased likelihood that the metatarsal bone will continue to drift out of position over time and for the bunion to return. Additionally, the recovery time has been reported to include up to 6 weeks of non-weight bearing. 



Shave Bump Unstable Foundation (Root of problem is not corrected) Cut & Shift Unstable Foundation (Root of problem is not corrected)
Lapidus Fusion
In contrast to 2D Osteotomy, the other common traditional surgical procedure, known as Lapidus Fusion, does address the root cause of the bunion and is routinely referenced in medical literature as a surgical option for bunions since the 1930s. However, even a Lapidus Fusion, as it is conventionally described and performed, still does not address the three-dimensional rotational aspect known to contribute to bunion recurrences.
A conventional Lapidus Fusion surgery fuses the unstable first TMT joint but requires a technically challenging correction through a “freehand” technique and has been reported to involve a protracted period of recovery, including approximately 6 to 8 weeks of non-weight-bearing. The freehand technique is highly dependent on the surgeon’s skill and requires the physician to perform complex corrections without the benefits of assistive instrumentation that are standard in many other orthopaedic joint procedures, and, consequently, this surgery often results in inconsistent outcomes. Thus, its use has been traditionally reserved for the most advanced and severe bunion pathology. 


The table below provides a summary overview of traditional bunion surgical treatment approaches:

 | 2D Osteotomy | Lapidus Fusion 
% of cases | Approximately 75% | Approximately 25% 
Procedure overview | | Targets cosmetic bump by cutting and shifting metatarsal bone in two dimensions | Fusion of the first TMT joint to realign the entire metatarsal and the toe joint and prevent the bunion from coming back
Procedure time | 25 to 75 minutes | 40 to 120 minutes 
Recurrence rate | 1.8% to 78%,depending on procedure type and follow-up duration | 0% to 38% 
Reported recovery time | 1 day to 6 weeks non-weight bearing (post-operative shoe or boot, some cast) | Long recovery: Traditionally 6 to 8 weeks non-weight bearing (often in a cast) 
Non-Union Rate* | 0% to 3.3% | 2.2% to 12% 
Hardware Removal Rate | 0% to 12.3% | 2% to 17% 
Patient dissatisfaction rate | 6% to 35% | 7% to 13% 
Limitations | •Does not address all 3 dimensions of the deformity reliably and leaves the unstable foundation untreated | •Technically challenging “freehand” procedure increases inconsistency and variability of results •Primarily 2-plane procedure; does not address the frontal plane rotation problem consistently 

 
*Non-union rate is a measure of the incidence of the bone not healing together.
While bunions have traditionally been viewed as a 2D deformity, recent scientific literature has indicated that 87% of bunions have a 3D, rotational component in addition to the horizontal and vertical misalignments of the metatarsal bone. Failure to correct this third “rotational” dimension of the bunion deformity has been reported to result in a 10 to 12 times increase in the chance of bunion recurrence as compared to 3D surgeries. We believe there is a rapidly increasing awareness among surgeons of the need for 3D bunion correction based on the frequency of lectures and medical journal publications on this topic, particularly in recent years.
Our Solution
We have pioneered our proprietary Lapiplasty 3D Bunion Correction System—a combination of innovative instruments, implants and surgical methods designed to correct all three planes of the bunion deformity and secure the unstable joint, addressing the root cause of the bunion.
Our Lapiplasty System
We believe our Lapiplasty System was the first and remains the leading system designed to consistently and reliably correct all three dimensions of the bunion deformity, address the root cause and allow return to weight-bearing quickly in a post-operative boot. In a Lapiplasty Procedure, the entire metatarsal bone is rotated and brought back into position in all three dimensions, eliminating the unsightly bump and restoring normal anatomy. The unstable foundation in the foot is secured with titanium plating technology allowing patients to get back on their feet quickly in a post-operative boot. The Lapiplasty Procedure can be performed on a wide range of patients with bunion deformities in the hospital outpatient or ambulatory surgery center setting and utilizes existing, well-established reimbursement codes.
The Lapiplasty System includes both procedural instrumentation and single-use, sterile-packed implant kits. Our procedural instrumentation includes innovative surgical tools designed to enable surgeons to correct all three dimensions of the bunion deformity

and the root cause of bunions with accuracy and consistency. Our single-use, sterile-packed implant kits feature biplanar plating, which are two low-profile titanium fixation plates designed to stabilize the TMT joint and to allow early weight-bearing in a post-operative boot during the critical healing period.
The following table illustrates key components of the Lapiplasty System:

Reusable procedural instrumentation | | Sterile-packed implant kits
Lapiplasty Positioner | Lapiplasty Compressor | | Sterile Implants and Instruments 
Engineered to quickly and reproducibly correct metatarsal alignment in all three dimensions Lapiplasty Cut Guide and Fulcrum Delivers precise cuts with the metatarsal held in the corrected position, ensuring optimal cut trajectory | Delivers controlled compression to the precision-cut joint surfaces, while maintaining the three-dimensional correction Lapiplasty Light-WeightTray Includes the Positioner, Compressor and Cut Guide and Fulcrum | | Single-use implants and instruments used in the Lapiplasty Procedure and ancillary procedures Biplanar Plating Provides biomechanically-tested biplanar stability; designed to allow rapid return to weight-bearing in a walking boot 

 

The following table illustrates our patented Lapiplasty System, with procedural instrumentation and implants used in each step of our proprietary Lapiplasty Procedure:

Lapiplasty System 
Correct. Make the correction before the cut Using the Lapiplasty Positioner, the entire metatarsal bone is returned to normal 3D alignment. 
Cut. Perform precision cuts with confidence Using the Lapiplasty Cut Guide, the unstable joint surfaces are cut in the corrected position. 
Compress. Achieve controlled compression of joint surfaces Using the Lapiplasty Compressor, the two bone surfaces are brought together while 3D correction is maintained. 
Fixate. Apply biplanar fixation for robust stability Using Biplanar Plating, two titaniumplates fastened at ninety degree angles,the joint is secured and stabilized, designed to allow for early return to weight-bearing in a post-operative boot while the bones fuse together. 

2022 Lapiplasty Advancements
 
In 2022, we introduced three new advancements in the Lapiplasty Procedure designed to make it faster and easier to perform. These include (i) the 3-n-1 Guide, which combines three separate instruments and three procedure steps into one instrument and step, (ii) the S4A Anatomic Plating System, which features advanced 3D contours designed to accommodate variations in patient anatomy, and (iii) the SpeedRelease Release Instrument, which is a single-use instrument designed to make a challenging soft tissue release performed in the majority of Lapiplasty cases easier to perform and more reproducible for the surgeon.

Our Minimally Invasive Approaches
 In an effort to continue expanding our Lapiplasty offerings, in 2021 we launched the Lapiplasty Mini-Incision System, which is designed to allow the Lapiplasty Procedure to be performed through a 3.5cm incision as compared to the 6cm to 8cm incision with the standard Lapiplasty Procedure. Some patients prefer smaller incisions that may leave less visible scars. The Lapiplasty Mini-Incision System includes a new fixation plate known as the PlantarPower Plate. This innovative plate is contoured to span across the bottom half of the joint where the loads are the highest, while still providing easy access for insertion of the plate fixation screws through a small incision. Continuing with minimally invasive approaches, in 2022, we began a limited release of the Micro-Lapiplasty Minimally Invasive System, which is designed to allow the deformity correction and joint preparation steps of the Lapiplasty Procedure to be performed through 2cm incisions, and previewed the compatible SpeedPlate Rapid Compression Implant System designed for rapid delivery of titanium compression implants through small incisions. We anticipate commercial release of SpeedPlate implants and the Micro-Lapiplasty instrumentation in the second half of 2023.
Our Adductoplasty System
In the third quarter of 2021, we launched the Adductoplasty System, which brings together our implants and precision instrumentation for a comprehensive system designed for reproducible realignment, stabilization, and fusion of the midfoot. Midfoot deformities may occur in up to 30% of bunion patients. The Adductoplasty System includes instruments together with our Lapiplasty fixation plates to be used for fusion of the second and third TMT joints, which may often be necessary in conjunction with bunion

surgery. In 2022, we introduced the TriTome Release Instrument, a sterile-packed, single-use instrument with three cutting edges designed to assist with a tissue release performed in the Adductoplasty Procedure.

Key Clinical Advantages of the Lapiplasty System
We believe that the differentiated clinical advantages of the Lapiplasty Procedure support its continued clinical adoption and help establish the Lapiplasty Procedure as the standard of care for bunion surgery. We are committed to advancing the understanding of the Lapiplasty Procedure and its benefits to patients, surgeons, facilities and payors through clinical studies and publications in peer-reviewed literature. The Lapiplasty Procedure had been cited in 21 peer-reviewed journal publications as of December 2022.
The table below includes published results of our outcomes, demonstrating the effectiveness and consistency of the Lapiplasty Procedure:

Key outcomes | Lapiplasty Procedure 
Recurrence rate | 0.9 – 3.2% 
Reported time to start weight-bearing | 1 – 11 days(post-operative boot)
Non-union rate* | 0 – 2.6% 
Hardware removal rate | 0 – 5.1% 

 * Non-union rate is a measure of the incidence of the bones not healing together.
Based on the outcomes from multiple studies, further discussed below, and our deep experience in the field of bunion surgery, we believe the key advantages of the Lapiplasty System include the system being designed for:
•consistent 3D deformity correction; 
 •addressing root cause of the deformity; 
 •ease and reproducibility of the procedure; 
 •fast return to weight-bearing post-surgery in a post-operative boot; 
 •slimmer foot (post 5-month follow up); and 
 •low rate of recurrence (as demonstrated across three separate studies which measured recurrence rates at different time points after the Lapiplasty Procedure: 0.9% at 12 months1,2, 3.2% at 13 months, and 0.9% at 17 months). 
 We have completed enrollment in our ALIGN3D prospective, multicenter study which is evaluating bunion correction status after five years and includes patient satisfaction scoring, range of motion results and radiographic outcomes. Interim analyses from the ALIGN3D clinical study have been published in the Journal of Foot & Ankle Surgery and most recently presented at industry conferences, including at the AOFAS Annual Meeting in September 2022, and at the ACFAS Annual Scientific Conference that was held in early February 2023. The Journal of Foot & Ankle Surgery publication presented an interim analysis (117 patients with at least 12 month follow-up) demonstrating early return to weight bearing in a walking boot at an average 7.8 days, return to work at an average 25.2 days, full unrestricted activity at an average of 4 months, significant improvement in radiographic measures of 3-dimensional bunion correction with 1 recurrence reported at 12 months (0.9% recurrence rate, n=108), and significant improvement in patient-reported pain reduction on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and quality of life measurements on the Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire (MOxFQ) and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Systems (PROMIS) scores. New interim data from the ALIGN3D clinical study highlighted at the 2023 ACFAS Annual Scientific Conference demonstrated 97% patient satisfaction rating at 36 months (n=37), with 92% and 90% improvement in walking/standing and social interaction scores, respectively, through 36 months (n=41); an 80.8% decrease in pain at 24 months; and a low recurrence rate of 0.9% (1 out of 114 patients) observed at 24 months post-surgery2.

1 This data on recurrence rates after the Lapiplasty Procedure is based on interim results of the ALIGN3D study published in the Journal of Foot & Ankle Surgery.
2 Subsequent interim data on the ALIGN3D study showed 1.4% of patients (2 out of 144 patients) demonstrated radiographic recurrence at 12 months post surgery.
 Our differentiated Lapiplasty System is designed to consistently and reliably correct all three dimensions of the bunion deformity and address its root cause, and its key clinical advantages that have been demonstrated in multiple peer-reviewed publications. A traditional 2D Osteotomy performs an incomplete correction addressing the cosmetic appearance of the bunion rather than the root cause of the deformity. Alternatively, while Lapidus Fusion does seek to address the root cause of the deformity, it does not address the 3D rotational aspect known to contribute to bunion recurrence, and involves a technically challenging “freehand” technique, which is highly dependent on the surgeon’s skill and requires the physician to perform complex corrections without the benefits of assistive instrumentation. The Lapiplasty System includes specifically engineered procedural instrumentation and implants that enable the physician to correct the bunion deformity with accuracy and consistency.


Clinical studies described in multiple peer-reviewed publications demonstrate the clinical benefits of the Lapiplasty System. These publications demonstrate that the Lapiplasty Procedure allows patients to quickly return to weight-bearing in a post-operative boot within 3 to 10 days. In addition, these publications demonstrated meaningfully low rates of recurrence (as described above). In addition, these studies indicate a low-rate in incidence of the bones not healing together (i.e., non-union rate) as well as a low rate of hardware removal. Finally, research also suggests that Lapiplasty may result in a significant decrease in post-operative bony and soft tissue width (i.e., a slimmer foot post 5-month follow up)—although not an indication for surgery, foot width reduction is often a desirable cosmetic and functional outcome and commonly associated with postoperative patient satisfaction. Given its demonstrated clinical benefits, we believe the Lapiplasty System provides a positive physician and patient experience, and through continued clinical adoption, is poised to become the standard of care for bunion surgery.

Commercial Strategy

We are investing in and executing a five-point strategy that includes rapid product innovations, a bunion-focused direct sales channel, surgeon education programs, direct-to-patient education, and supportive clinical evidence.
 

We currently market and sell the Lapiplasty System through a combination of a direct employee sales force and independent sales agencies across 193 territories in the United States. As of December 31, 2022, we had 168 employee sales representatives and 25 independent sales agencies. In 2022, employee sales representatives generated approximately 72% of total revenue while approximately 28% of revenue came through independent sales agencies. In 2021, employee sales representatives generated approximately 52% of total revenue while approximately 48% came through independent sales agencies.
We have and are continuing to dedicate meaningful resources to expand our sales force and management team in the United States. We have hired and expect to continue to hire additional employee sales representatives and employee field sales management to strategically access more regions with high densities of prospective patients. We believe this strategy will:
•accelerate growth and better penetrate the market with our products; 
 •further align incentives and allow for improved coordination of our sales team; and 
 •improve profitability with better operating leverage in the longer term. 
 We believe our surgeon education and training programs differentiate us from our competitors. We devote significant resources to training and educating physicians on the safe and effective use of the Lapiplasty System. Our comprehensive education programs include cadaveric workshops, technical assistance in the operating room and advanced training for both new and existing surgeon

customers. We believe our multiple post-market clinical outcome studies are also unique in the bunion correction field and are a key element of our medical education program.
Our practice is to require surgeons to complete a simulated surgical training program before performing the Lapiplasty Procedure. To facilitate this training, we have developed a robust curriculum including clinical and procedural details as well as hands-on surgical workshops designed to simulate a live surgical procedure. These training events incorporate highly-skilled training personnel including experienced surgeon faculty and clinical specialists. Additionally, we host ongoing peer-to-peer advanced educational training programs to continue to develop the expertise of our surgeon customers, which include monthly online "Mastery Webinar" series and hands-on workshops with experienced faculty surgeons that cover more advanced Lapiplasty techniques and training on our newly developed products and procedures. Our training programs are complemented by 12 clinical specialists that assist with surgeon training and live surgery support with new surgeon users. We believe that our surgeon education programs are effective, and they are intended to result in surgeon users improving their skill and familiarity with the Lapiplasty Procedure and improved clinical outcomes for their patients.
Surgeons generally can perform their first case after they have been trained and our products have been approved by the surgical facility. Obtaining facility approval may delay surgeon access to our products for 30 to 120 days or more depending on the nature of the facility (or integrated delivery network's) approval process.

Surgeon users typically increase usage of the Lapiplasty Procedure over time as they see improved clinical outcomes for their patients relative to traditional bunion surgery approaches. The bar chart below shows as of December 31, 2022 the average number of procedures performed over the trailing twelve months by surgeons based on the number of years that the surgeons have used the Lapiplasty System.

For the chart above, more than twelve months must have elapsed from the date of the surgeon's first use for the surgeon to be included in the year 1 column.
 We believe our offering is differentiated by supporting surgeons with knowledgeable clinical specialists and direct sales employees who are experts in the Lapiplasty Procedure. These employees receive in-depth training to develop a thorough understanding of bunions, patient selection, procedure planning and regulatory policies to meaningfully support continued clinical adoption and existing surgeon customers. Our clinical specialists and direct sales employees participate in continuous education programs that consist of in-person foundational training, procedure observation and sales skills development. These employees are a key resource for our surgeon customers and their expertise enables them to provide meaningful clinical and technical support in the

operating room and to develop strong relationships with surgeons. We believe that our approach to supporting surgeons leads to better clinical outcomes for patients.
Our direct-to-patient outreach program is a key aspect of our commercial strategy. This program is focused on educating patients on the clinical advantages of the Lapiplasty Procedure and generating brand awareness. We are working to further establish brand recognition for Lapiplasty as the leading procedure for improving bunion treatment outcomes in an industry that has traditionally not conducted significant direct-to-patient programs. We have built a sophisticated marketing infrastructure to deliver our message in a targeted manner utilizing digital and traditional marketing channels. These programs direct potential bunion surgical candidates to our educational website that further explains the Lapiplasty Procedure and its related benefits and risks. Our “Find a Doctor” tool allows them to search for experienced Lapiplasty Procedure surgeons in their local markets.

The following diagram illustrates our patient outreach program.

   Research and Development
We devote significant resources to research and development of our products. We use internal employee engineering personnel and our Surgeon Advisory Board to generate ideas and develop product innovations. Our Surgeon Advisory Board is comprised of both podiatrists and orthopaedic foot and ankle surgeons who provide us with holistic insights for developing products that fully meet the needs of each group. Our development team is focused on improving clinical outcomes by designing new procedure-specific products and by developing enhanced surgical techniques in attractive subspecialties within the foot and ankle market.
Our initial product development and commercial efforts have been focused on the bunion market, and our Lapiplasty System specifically. We intend to continue iterating our core Lapiplasty System instrumentation and implants to improve surgical efficiency, enhance reproducibility of outcomes and speed up surgical recovery for patients. We are also pursuing the development and potential commercialization, if cleared, of new products that we believe would leverage and expand our position in the market to treat other concomitant pathologies that occur in a high percentage of bunion surgeries. Products provided by other companies are currently utilized in some of our Lapiplasty Procedure cases to treat these concomitant conditions. Providing these ancillary products allows us to capture a higher percentage of the overall product revenue from the surgical case while providing greater efficiency and synergies to the facility and operating room staff by reducing the number of vendors needed to support the case.
Coverage and Reimbursement
The Lapiplasty Procedure is performed by foot and ankle surgeons in both hospital outpatient facilities and ambulatory surgery centers. Hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and surgeons that purchase or use our products generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse for all or part of the costs and fees associated with procedures using our products. As a result, sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which the procedures using our products are covered by third-party payors, including government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care programs. Based on historical claims data from 2017, approximately 63% of Lapidus cases and 60% of all bunion surgical cases were paid by private payors.

Medicare publishes national average rates for each procedure in the hospital outpatient and ambulatory surgery center settings. Medicare rates for procedures involving our products may vary from national averages due to geographic location, the nature of facility in which the procedure is performed (i.e., teaching or community hospital) and other factors. While private payors vary in their coverage and payment policies, many use coverage and payment by Medicare as a benchmark to make their own decisions.

Coding and Reimbursement
When procedures using our products are performed in hospital outpatient or ambulatory surgery center settings, both the surgeon and the health care facility submit claims (bills) for payment to the third-party payor using established medical codes (e.g., CPT codes, diagnosis codes and HCPCS codes) that describe the patient history and medical and surgical treatments. Obtaining appropriate payment for services is dependent in part on the physician and health care facility reporting or billing the CPT code that accurately describes the procedures performed in the case.
The table below sets forth the established CPT codes that are commonly used for Lapidus-type and midfoot fusion surgeries, including the Lapiplasty and Adductoplasty Procedures.
 
Established CPT Codes
CPT 28297 | Correction, bunionectomy, with sesamoidectomy, when performed; with first metatarsal and medial cuneiform joint arthrodesis, any method 
CPT 28730 | Arthrodesis, midtarsal or tarsometatarsal, multiple or transverse 
CPT 28740CPT 28735 | Arthrodesis, midtarsal or tarsometatarsal, single joint Arthrodesis, midtarsal or tarsometatarsal, multiple or transverse; with osteotomy (e.g., flatfoot correction)

 Bunion surgery also often involves multiple concomitant procedures, including Akin osteotomy, Weil osteotomy and hammertoe correction, for example. Each concomitant procedure has an applicable CPT code used for billing third-party payors, which is submitted on the same claim with the Lapiplasty Procedure for reimbursement.
 Intellectual Property
We actively seek to protect the technology, inventions, and improvements that we consider important to our business using patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights in the United States and foreign markets.
As of December 31, 2022, our patent portfolio included 39 owned U.S. patents, one licensed U.S. patent and 10 owned foreign patents. All of the U.S. patents are utility patents. The owned patents cover core Lapiplasty-related hardware and surgical techniques as well as other associated innovations, including the main surgical techniques used by the Lapiplasty Procedure as well as associated tools, techniques and/or implants used during the procedure. Our foreign granted patents are in Australia, the European Patent Convention and Japan. Our owned patents expire in 2035 or later.
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 81 pending patent applications globally, including 46 in the United States. Outside of the United States we have patent applications pending in Australia, Canada, Europe (before the European Patent Office) and Japan as well as through the Patent Cooperation Treaty ("PCT").
 We have also obtained an exclusive license with respect to a third-party United States patent application that has now matured into a granted patent. This licensed patent expires in 2034. Our patents are intended to exclude competitors from practicing the innovations of our currently marketed product offering and to protect potential future commercialization opportunities and to strategically block potential workarounds by competitors.
We own U.S. trademark registrations for several of our most important marks, including "Treace Medical Concepts®", the "Treace Medical Concepts®" logo, "Lapiplasty®", "Fast Grafter®", "FastPitch®", "Adductoplasty®", "SpeedSeeker®" and "The Leader in Hallux Valgus Surgery®". We also have pending U.S. trademark registrations on other valuable marks, including "Align My Toe", "Fix It Right The First Time", "Micro-Lapiplasty", "SpeedPlate", "SpeedRelease", "TriTome" and "3-n-1".
The term of individual patents depends on the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a nonprovisional patent application in the applicable country. We cannot assure that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications or that, if patents are issued, they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection for our technology. Notwithstanding the scope of the patent protection available to us, a competitor could develop treatment methods or devices that are not covered by our patents. Furthermore, numerous U.S. and foreign-issued patents and patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we have commercialized and are developing products. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be

applications unknown to us, which applications may later result in issued patents that our existing or future products or technologies may be alleged to infringe.
There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry. We have initiated lawsuits in the past and may bring lawsuits in the future to enforce patents issued or licensed to us, enforce our rights in trademarks and copyright, to protect our trade secrets or know-how, to defend against claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation is costly and diverts our attention from other functions and responsibilities. Furthermore, even if our patents are found to be valid and infringed, a court may refuse to grant injunctive relief against the infringer and instead grant us monetary damages and/or ongoing royalties. Such monetary compensation may be insufficient to adequately offset the damage to our business caused by the infringer’s competition in the market.
In connection with future additional lawsuits to enforce our patents issued or licensed to us, adverse determinations in such future litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, could require us to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using our product or techniques, any of which could severely harm our business.
Our knowledge and experience, creative product development, marketing staff and trade secret information, with respect to manufacturing processes, materials and product design, are as important as our patents in maintaining our proprietary product lines. As a condition of employment, we require all employees and key contractors to execute an agreement obligating them to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information and assign to us inventions and other intellectual property created during their employment. For more information, refer to Item 1A, "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property".
Royalty and License Agreements
We have entered into product development and fee for service agreements with members of our Surgeon Advisory Board that specify the terms under which the member is compensated for his or her consulting services and grants us rights to the intellectual property created by the member in the course of such services. As products are commercialized with the assistance of members of the Surgeon Advisory Board, we may agree to enter into a royalty agreement if the member’s contributions to the product are novel, significant and innovative.
We have entered into royalty agreements with certain members of our Surgeon Advisory Board providing royalties based on each individual’s level of contribution. Each royalty agreement: (i) confirms the irrevocable transfer to us of all pertinent intellectual property rights; (ii) sets the applicable royalty rate; (iii) sets the period of time during which royalties are payable; (iv) is for a term of three years, renewable by the parties, and may be terminated by either party on 90 days notice for convenience (provided that if terminated by the Company for convenience the obligation to pay royalties is not affected); and (v) prohibits the payment of royalties on products sold to entities and/or individuals with whom the surgeon advisor or any other surgeon advisor entitled to royalties is affiliated. Each of the royalty agreements may be subsequently amended to add the license of additional intellectual property covering new products, and as a result, multiple royalty rates and duration of royalty payments may be included in one royalty agreement.
For more information about royalty payments, please see Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to the Financial Statements.
 Manufacturing and Supply
We currently leverage third-party manufacturing relationships to ensure low-cost production while maintaining a capital efficient business model. We have no long-term supply contracts and generally have multiple sources of supply for critical components of the Lapiplasty System. Our supply agreements do not have minimum manufacturing or purchase obligations. As such, we have no obligation to buy any given quantity of products, and our suppliers have no obligation to sell us or to manufacture for us any given quantity of our products or components for our products. In most cases, we have redundant manufacturing capabilities for each of our products. To date, we have not experienced any significant difficulty obtaining our products or components for our products necessary to meet demand, and we have only experienced limited instances where our suppliers had difficulty supplying products by the requested delivery date. We believe manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet market demand for our products for the foreseeable future.
The suppliers for the Lapiplasty System and our other products are evaluated, qualified and approved through our supplier management program, which includes various evaluations, assessments, qualifications, validations, testing and inspection to ensure the supplier can meet acceptable quality requirements. We implement a robust change control policy with our key suppliers to ensure that no component or process changes are made without our prior approval.

Order quantities and lead times for components purchased from suppliers are based on our forecasts derived from both historical demand and anticipated future demand. Lead times for components may vary depending on the size of the order, time required to fabricate, specific supplier requirements and current market demand for the components, sub-assemblies and materials.
Competition
Our industry is competitive, subject to technological change and significantly affected by new product introductions and market activities of other industry participants. Our existing products are, and any future products we commercialize will be, subject to competition. We believe the principal competitive factors in our markets include:
•The quality of outcomes and adverse event rates. 
 •Patient experience, including patient recovery time and level of discomfort. 
 •Acceptance by surgeons, hospitals and other health care providers. 
 •Physician learning curves and willingness to adopt new techniques. 
 •Ease of use and reliability. 
 •Strength of clinical evidence. 
 •Economic benefits and cost savings. 
 •Strength and scope of intellectual property protections.
 •Effective distribution and marketing to surgeons and potential patients. 
 •Product price and qualification for coverage and reimbursement. 
 •A highly specialized and focused sales force.
 •Speed to market. 
 •Surgeon training and medical education programs. 
 
Our competition includes medical device manufacturers in the orthopaedic foot and ankle market. Stryker Corporation is currently the leader in the orthopaedic foot and ankle market and has significant market share following its acquisition of Wright Medical in November 2020. Additional companies operating in the orthopaedic foot and ankle market with products specifically focused on bunion surgery include CrossRoads Extremity Systems, which was acquired in 2022 by DePuy Synthes Products, Inc., a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary, Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc., Paragon 28, Inc., In2Bones Global, Inc., a subsidiary of CONMED Corporation, Medartis Holding AG, Novastep Inc., Arthrex, Inc., Fusion Orthopedics, LLC, and Enovis Corporation (formerly Colfax). While foot and ankle product sales represent a relatively small percentage of our larger competitors’ overall sales, many recognize the growth opportunities in this market and have been active in product additions through both internal development efforts and acquisitions.
Our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market, expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified research & development, sales, marketing and management personnel, establishing clinical sites and patient registration for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors. In addition to competing for market share for the Lapiplasty Procedure, we also compete against these companies for personnel, including qualified personnel that are necessary to grow our business.
Finally, we may compete with medical device manufacturers outside the United States if and when we pursue plans to market our products internationally. Among other competitive advantages, such companies may have more established sales and marketing programs and networks, established relationships with health care professionals and greater name recognition in such markets.
Government Regulation
Our products and our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and other federal and state authorities in the United States, and if we begin offering our products outside the United States, comparable authorities in foreign jurisdictions. Our products are subject to regulation as medical devices in the United States under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA") as implemented and enforced by the FDA.
United States Regulation
The FDA regulates the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution, and import and export of medical devices to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the FDCA.
FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification or FDA approval of a premarket approval application ("PMA"). Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation ("QSR"), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents.
While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device, also referred to as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life sustaining, life supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Our currently marketed products are Class I exempt devices and Class II devices subject to 510(k) clearance.
 510(k) Clearance Marketing Pathway
Certain of our current products are subject to premarket notification and clearance under section 510(k) of the FDCA. To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed predicate device, i.e., a device that was legally marketed before May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to twelve months but may take longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. In addition, the FDA collects user fees for certain medical device submissions and annual fees for medical device establishments. For fiscal year 2023, the standard user fee for a 510(k) premarket notification application is $19,870.
 If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device.
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval or de novo classification. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k), de novo classification or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance, approval of a PMA, or issuance of a de novo classification. Also, in these circumstances, the manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
PMA Approval Pathway
Class III devices require PMA approval before they can be marketed, although some pre-amendment Class III devices for which FDA has not yet required approval of a PMA are cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA process is more complex, costly and time consuming than the 510(k) premarket notification process. A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including, but not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, preclinical and clinical trials, manufacturing,

and labeling information to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. The PMA application must provide valid scientific evidence that demonstrates to the FDA’s satisfaction reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of the PMA, although in practice, the FDA’s review often takes significantly longer, and can take up to several years. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided, and the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant’s response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA. Also, during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with quality system regulation. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain, and lengthy, and a number of devices for which FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the FDA for marketing. None of our products are marketed pursuant to a PMA.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. All clinical investigations of investigational devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption ("IDE") regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device is determined to present a “significant risk” to human health, the manufacturer may not begin a clinical trial until it submits an IDE application to the FDA and obtains approval of the IDE from the FDA. The IDE must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board ("IRB"), for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements. A clinical trial may be suspended by FDA, the sponsor, or an IRB at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to the study participants outweigh the benefits of participation in the trial. Even if a clinical trial is completed, the results may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a device to the satisfaction of the FDA or may be equivocal or otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval of a device. We are not currently undertaking any FDA IDE trials, as all of our existing products are FDA-cleared through the 510(k) pathway. It is possible, however, that future device development may require IDE clinical trial for approval.
 Post-Market Regulation
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
•establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; 
 •QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process; 
 •labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of investigational products, or the promotion of “off-label” uses of cleared or approved products; 
 •requirements related to promotional activities; 
 •clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices, or approval of certain modifications to PMA-approved devices; 
 •medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur; 
 •correction, removal, and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; 


•the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and 
 •post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. 
 Manufacturing processes for medical devices are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. Manufacturers are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of marketed products. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any marketed products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls.
 The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that a manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:
•warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 
 •recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products; 
 •operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
 •refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products; 
 •withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted; 
 •refusal to grant export approvals for our products; or 
 •criminal prosecution. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement
In the United States, our currently approved products are commonly treated as general supplies utilized in orthopaedic surgery and if covered by third-party payors, are paid for as part of the surgical procedure. Outside of the United States, there are many reimbursement programs through private payors as well as government programs. In some countries, government reimbursement is the predominant program available to patients and hospitals. Our commercial success depends in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for the procedures during which our products are used. Failure by physicians, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and other users of our products to obtain sufficient coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures in which our products are used, or adverse changes in government and private third-party payor's coverage and reimbursement policies could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Based on our experience to date, third-party payors generally reimburse for the surgical procedures in which our products are used only if the patient meets the established medical necessity criteria for surgery. Some payors are moving toward a managed care system and control their health care costs by limiting authorizations for surgical procedures, including elective procedures using our devices. Although no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement among payors in the United States exists and coverage and reimbursement for procedures can differ significantly from payor to payor, reimbursement decisions by particular third-party payors may depend upon a number of factors, including the payor’s determination that use of a product is:
•a covered benefit under its health plan; 
 •appropriate and medically necessary for the specific indication; 
 •cost effective; and 
 •neither experimental nor investigational. 
 Third-party payors are increasingly auditing and challenging the prices charged for medical products and services with concern for upcoding, miscoding, using inappropriate modifiers, or billing for inappropriate care settings. Some third-party payors must approve coverage for new or innovative devices or procedures before they reimburse health care providers who use the products or

therapies. Even though a new product may have been cleared for commercial distribution by the FDA, we may find limited demand for the product unless and until reimbursement approval has been obtained from governmental and private third-party payors.

A key component in ensuring whether the appropriate payment amount is received for physician and other services, including those procedures using our products, is the existence of a Current Procedural Terminology ("CPT") code, to describe the procedure in which the product is used. To receive payment, health care practitioners must submit claims to insurers using these codes for payment for medical services. CPT codes are assigned, maintained and annually updated by the American Medical Association and its CPT Editorial Board. If the CPT codes that apply to the procedures performed using our products are changed or deleted, reimbursement for performance of these procedures may be adversely affected.
In the United States, some insured individuals enroll in managed care programs, which monitor and often require pre-approval of the services that a member will receive. Some managed care programs pay their providers on a per capita (patient) basis, which puts the providers at financial risk for the services provided to their patients by paying these providers a predetermined payment per member per month and, consequently, may limit the willingness of these providers to use our products.
We believe the overall escalating cost of medical products and services being paid for by the government and private health insurance has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the health care and medical device industry to reduce the costs of products and services. All third-party reimbursement programs are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling health care costs through prospective reimbursement and capitation programs, group purchasing, redesign of benefits, requiring second opinions before major surgery, careful review of bills, encouragement of healthier lifestyles and other preventative services and exploration of more cost-effective methods of delivering health care.
In addition to uncertainties surrounding coverage policies, there are periodic changes to reimbursement levels. Third-party payors regularly update reimbursement amounts and also from time to time revise the methodologies used to determine reimbursement amounts. This includes routine updates to payments to physicians, hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers for procedures during which our products are used. These updates could directly impact the demand for our products.
Health Care Reform
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in health care systems with the stated goals of containing health care costs, improving quality or expanding access. Current and future legislative proposals to further reform health care or reduce health care costs may limit coverage of or lower reimbursement for the procedures associated with the use of our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any health care reform initiative implemented in the future could impact our revenue from the sale of our products.
In the United States, the implementation of the Affordable Care Act ("ACA") for example, has changed health care financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers substantially, and affected medical device manufacturers significantly. The ACA, among other things, provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research, and implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain health care services through bundled payment models. Additionally, the ACA expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs and created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. We are also affected by regulatory and legislative changes affecting Medicare payments and processing and reimbursement received by our customers.
We expect additional state and federal health care reform measures to be adopted in the future, some of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.
Federal, State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse and Physician Payment Transparency Laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing and promotion of drugs and devices, other federal and state laws restrict our business practices. These laws include, without limitation, foreign, federal, and state anti-kickback and false claims laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to health care providers.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good,

facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal health care covered business, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions and, in some cases, may apply more broadly to items or services covered by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers and self-pay patients.
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Private parties may initiate “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits against any person or entity under the federal civil False Claims Act in the name of the government and share in the proceeds of the lawsuit.
In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits, among other things, the offer or transfer of remuneration, including waivers of copayments and deductible amounts (or any part thereof), to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program.
 HIPAA also created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased foreign, federal, and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to health care professionals or entities. The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act imposes annual reporting requirements on certain drug, biologics, medical supplies and device manufacturers for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or Children’s Health Insurance Program for payments and other transfers of value provided by them, directly or indirectly, to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician practitioners (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants and certified nurse midwives), and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Certain foreign countries and U.S. states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to health care professionals and entities.
 Penalties for violation of any of the health care laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us include, without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of an entity’s operations.
 Data Privacy & Security
 Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations and standards govern the collection, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information and could apply now or in the future to our operations or the operations of our service providers. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 We believe in the value of a diverse and inclusive team as an enabler to getting the best ideas, innovating, and creating great outcomes for our customers and their patients. To drive great business results, we must have the right people in the right role with great leadership, culture, training and rewards, all aligned with our values and business strategies.
 To achieve these goals, we are committed to developing great talent at all levels of the organization: by growing talent internally, hiring great external talent, and ensuring bench strength and succession plans at all levels throughout the organization. We have a number of initiatives in place to attract, develop and retain great talent in a rewarding and inclusive culture. Some of the highlights of our approach are as follows:
 Talent Acquisition: As of December 31, 2022, we had 423 full-time employees. During 2022, we increased the number of employees by 70% to support the rapid growth of our business, with 65% of the new hires being added to our sales team. As we recruit, we are innovatively expanding external talent pools, and we actively seek talent of diverse backgrounds and strive to provide a work environment where the best ideas are welcomed from anywhere.
Talent Development: On an annual basis, our leadership team participates in a talent review and succession planning exercise to identify organizational needs, development opportunities, and potential future leaders. As a result of these efforts and our commitment to providing growth opportunities for our talent, 18% of our employees were promoted or took new positions during 2022. We experienced a low undesired turnover of under 7%, despite the market's strong competition for talent.
Total Rewards: Our human capital strategies, initiatives, and outcomes are reviewed on a regular basis with the compensation committee of our board of directors. In addition, we partner with consulting firms to regularly benchmark our peer group companies and the broader market, and as a result of this analysis, we have implemented a number of changes to our rewards practices which we believe allows us to maintain our competitiveness in the market. We also believe strongly in providing employees the opportunity to participate as owners in the Company; this is done through broad-based equity programs granting stock options and restricted stock units, with the majority of our employees having received at least one equity grant.
Culture: We are committed to delivering an inclusive culture that fosters creativity and innovation, that allows employees to be their best at work. We offer a collegial, collaborative culture supported by competitive, performance-based compensation and benefits, equity awards, career development opportunities, and access to continual growth through live and remote training. We conducted an employee engagement survey in 2022 that showed that 87% of our employees are engaged, which compares favorably with average engagement of 76% of the approximately 80 medical device and biotechnology companies in the benchmark compiled by the independent third-party consulting firm that conducted the engagement survey. We will use these survey results to determine how we can continue to create work environments that energize our employees and enable them to develop and maintain a positive working culture. In addition, none of our employees are represented by a labor union or are a party to a collective bargaining agreement.
 Facilities
As of December 31, 2022, we leased approximately 125,000 square feet for our corporate headquarters located in Ponte Vedra, Florida under a lease agreement which terminates in July 2032. We believe that this facility is sufficient to meet our current and anticipated needs in the future and that additional space can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms as needed. We are also obligated to lease a part of our previous corporate headquarters location until August 2026. However, we have subleased a portion of this space and continue to market the remainder of the space.
