Item 1. Business 
Our Company and Our Business Strategy
Ashford Inc., a Nevada corporation, is an alternative asset management company with a portfolio of strategic operating businesses that provides products and services primarily to clients in the real estate and hospitality industries, including Ashford Trust and Braemar. We became a public company in November 2014, and our common stock is listed on the NYSE American. As of December 31, 2022, Mr. Monty J. Bennett, Ashford Inc.’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of Ashford Trust and Braemar, and his father, Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr., Chairman Emeritus of Ashford Trust, owned approximately 610,246 shares of our common stock, which represented an approximately 19.6% ownership interest in Ashford Inc., and owned 18,758,600 shares of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series D Convertible Preferred Stock”), which, along with all unpaid accrued and accumulated dividends thereon, is convertible at a price of $117.50 per share into an additional approximate 4,145,385 shares of Ashford Inc. common stock, which if converted as of December 31, 2022 would have increased Mr. Monty J. Bennett and Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr.’s ownership interest in Ashford Inc. to approximately 65.5%.
We provide: (i) advisory services; (ii) asset management services; (iii) hotel management services; (iv) design and construction services; (v) event technology and creative communications solutions; (vi) mobile room keys and keyless entry solutions; (vii) watersports activities and other travel, concierge and transportation services; (viii) hypoallergenic premium room products and services; (ix) debt placement and related services; (x) real estate advisory and brokerage services; and (xi) wholesaler, dealer manager and other broker-dealer services. We conduct these activities and own substantially all of our assets primarily through Ashford LLC, Ashford Services and their respective subsidiaries.
We seek to grow through the implementation of two primary strategies: (i) increasing our assets under management; and (ii) pursuing third-party business to grow our other products and services businesses. 
Advisory Services. We are currently the advisor for Ashford Trust and Braemar. In our capacity as the advisor to Ashford Trust and Braemar, we are responsible for implementing the investment strategies and managing the day-to-day operations of Ashford Trust and Braemar and their respective hotels from an ownership perspective, in each case subject to the respective advisory agreements and the supervision and oversight of the respective boards of directors of Ashford Trust and Braemar. Ashford Trust is focused on investing in full-service hotels in the upscale and upper upscale segments in the United States that have revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) generally less than twice the U.S. national average. Braemar invests primarily in luxury hotels and resorts with RevPAR of at least twice the U.S. national average. Each of Ashford Trust and Braemar is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”), and the common stock of each of Ashford Trust and Braemar is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”).
We provide the personnel and services that we believe are necessary for each of Ashford Trust and Braemar to conduct their respective businesses. We may also perform similar functions for new or additional platforms. In our capacity as an advisor, we are not responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of Ashford Trust or Braemar’s individual hotel properties, which duties are, and will continue to be, the responsibility of the hotel management companies that operate such hotel properties. Additionally, Remington, a subsidiary of the Company, operates certain hotel properties for Ashford Trust, Braemar and third-parties. As of December 31, 2022, Remington provided hotel management services to 118 properties, 45 of which were owned by third-parties. 
In our advisory services business, we earn advisory fees from each company that we advise. The fees earned from each company that we advise include a base fee, payable in cash, on a monthly basis, for managing the respective day-to-day operations of the companies that we advise and the day-to-day operations of their respective hotels from an ownership perspective, in each case in conformity with the respective investment guidelines of such client. The base fee is determined as a percentage of each client’s total market capitalization, subject to a minimum fee. We may also be entitled to receive an incentive fee, payable in cash or a combination of cash and stock, from each of Ashford Trust and Braemar based on their respective out-performance of their peers, as measured by the annual total stockholder return of such company compared to its peers. Incentive advisory fees are measured annually in each year that Ashford Trust’s and/or Braemar’s annual total stockholder return exceeds the average annual total stockholder return for each company’s respective peer group, subject to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Condition (the “FCCR Condition”), and is defined in the respective advisory agreements. Incentive advisory fees, measured with respect to a particular year, are paid over a three-year period, beginning on January 15 immediately following the year of measurement, and each payment is subject to the FCCR Condition, which relates to the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges for Ashford Trust or Braemar, as applicable. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we earned advisory services fees of $34.8 million and $13.1 million from Ashford Trust and Braemar, respectively, of which $0 and $268,000 were incentive fees. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we earned advisory services fees of $36.2 million and $10.8 million from Ashford Trust and Braemar, respectively, of which $0 were incentive fees.
Asset Management Services. We provide asset management services to Ashford Trust and Braemar. Our strategic approach of designating at least one asset manager to each property allows us to leverage our extensive portfolio of subject matter experts, including asset management, revenue optimization, capital management, legal and risk management, data analysis and property tax. Our fees for asset management services are included in advisory services fees as noted above.
Hotel Management Services. As of December 31, 2022, we provide hotel management services to 69 properties for Ashford Trust, four properties for Braemar and 45 properties for third-parties through our subsidiary, Remington. Hotel management services consist of hotel operations, sales and marketing, revenue management, budget oversight, guest service, asset maintenance (not involving capital expenditures) and related services.
In our hotel management business, Remington receives a base management fee based on gross revenues for each hotel, subject to a specified floor (which is subject to increase annually based on increases in the consumer price index) and an incentive fee if a hotel meets and exceeds various thresholds based on hotel revenues and certain profitability targets. Additionally, Remington receives from certain third-party owned properties fixed monthly accounting fees and fees for revenue management services. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we earned hotel management fees of $29.9 million, $3.7 million and $12.9 million from Ashford Trust, Braemar and third-party clients, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we earned hotel management fees of $22.0 million, $2.9 million and $1.3 million from Ashford Trust, Braemar and third-party clients, respectively.

Our Advisory Agreements 
We advise Ashford Trust and Braemar pursuant to our advisory agreements. The provisions of the two advisory agreements are substantially similar, except as otherwise described below. The following summary of the terms of our advisory agreements does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to a copy of the actual agreements, as amended, entered into with Ashford Trust or Braemar, which have been included as exhibits to other documents filed with the SEC and incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K.
General. Pursuant to our advisory agreements with Ashford Trust and Braemar, we provide, or obtain on their behalf, the personnel and services necessary for each of these entities to conduct its respective business, as they have no employees of their own. All of the officers of each of Ashford Trust and Braemar are our employees. We are not obligated to dedicate any of our employees exclusively to either Ashford Trust or Braemar, nor are we or our employees obligated to dedicate any specific portion of time to the business of either Ashford Trust or Braemar, except as necessary to perform the service required of us in our capacity as the advisor to such entities. The advisory agreements require us to manage the business affairs of each of Ashford Trust and Braemar in conformity with the policies and the guidelines that are approved and monitored by the boards of such entities. Additionally, we must refrain from taking any action that would (a) adversely affect the status of Ashford Trust or Braemar as a REIT, (b) subject us to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”), (c) knowingly and intentionally violate any law, rule or regulation of any governmental body or agency having jurisdiction over us, (d) violate any of the rules or regulations of any exchange on which our securities are listed, or (e) violate the charter, bylaws or resolutions of the board of directors of each of Ashford Trust and Braemar, all as in effect from time to time. So long as we are the advisor to Braemar, Braemar’s governing documents permit us to designate two persons as candidates for election as director at any stockholder meeting of Braemar at which directors are to be elected. Such nominees may be our executive officers. If the size of Braemar’s board of directors is increased at any time to more than seven directors, our right to nominate 
shall be increased by such number of directors as shall be necessary to maintain the ratio of directors nominated by us to the directors otherwise nominated, as nearly as possible (rounding to the next larger whole number), equal to the ratio that would have existed if Braemar’s board of directors consisted of seven members.
Our Duties as Advisor. Subject to the supervision of the respective boards of directors of each of Ashford Trust and Braemar, we are responsible for, among other duties: (1) performing and administering the day-to-day operations of Ashford Trust and Braemar, including all of the subsidiaries and joint ventures of such entities; (2) all services relating to the acquisition, disposition and financing of hotels; (3) performing asset management duties; (4) engaging and supervising, on behalf of such companies, third-parties to provide various services including but not limited to overseeing development management, hotel management, and other professional services; and (5) performing corporate governance and other management functions, including financial, capital markets, treasury, financial reporting, internal audit, accounting, tax and risk management services, SEC and regulatory compliance, and retention of legal counsel, auditors and other professional advisors, as well as other duties and services outlined in the advisory agreements.
Any increase in the scope of duties or services to be provided by us must be jointly approved by us and either Ashford Trust or Braemar, as applicable, and is subject to additional compensation as outlined in the advisory agreements.
Under our advisory agreements with Ashford Trust and Braemar, we have the right to provide all services offered by us. At any time that Ashford Trust or Braemar desires to engage a third-party for the performance of services or delivery of products, we have the exclusive right to provide such service or product at market rates.
We also have the power to delegate all or any part of our rights and powers to manage and control the business and affairs of such companies to such officers, employees, affiliates, agents and representatives of ours or such company as we may deem appropriate. Any authority delegated by us to any other person is subject to the limitations on our rights and powers specifically set forth in the advisory agreement or the charter of such company.
We require our employees and officers who provide services to the companies we advise to comply with the codes and the policies of such companies.
On January 14, 2021, the Company entered into the Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, by and among Ashford Trust, Ashford Trust OP, Ashford TRS Corporation, the Company and Ashford LLC. The Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement amended and restated the terms of the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, dated as of June 10, 2015, as amended by the Enhanced Return Funding Program Agreement and Amendment No. 1 to the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, dated as of June 26, 2018 (the “Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement”). The terms of the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement were set forth under the heading “Our Advisory Agreements” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and are incorporated by reference herein. The Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, among other things, provides for the following revised terms:
Term. The Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement replaced the existing perpetual term with an initial 10-year term, subject to an extension by the Company for up to seven successive additional 10-year renewal terms which such extensions shall permit either party to elect to renegotiate the fees to be charged pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement.
Termination. Ashford Trust is no longer permitted to terminate the Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement (i) at the end of each initial or renewal term based on Ashford Trust’s and the Company’s inability to find a resolution on the fees to be charged, based upon the then-current market for such fees or (ii) upon a change of control of the Company. Additionally, the Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement includes certain clarifying language, including provisions making clear that in the event a tender offer, voting event or agreement that, upon consummation, would constitute a Company Change of Control (as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement) is terminated, any amounts deposited into the Termination Fee Escrow Account may be disbursed to Ashford Trust.
Subordination and Deferral of Fees. The Company agreed to subordinate its interest in the termination fee to Ashford Trust’s lenders to the extent, on or before the first anniversary of the Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, Ashford Trust enters into a loan agreement pursuant to which Ashford Trust agrees to pledge all or substantially all of its assets to the lenders thereunder. Additionally, the Company agreed to defer the portion of base fees and incentive fees pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement that exceed 80% of the amount of such fees paid by Ashford Trust to the Company for advisory services rendered during 2019 until the later of (i) two years after the date of an applicable loan entered into by Ashford Trust and (ii) such time as all capitalized interest under the applicable loan has been paid in full (the “Advisory Fee Cap”). On October 12, 2021, Ashford Trust entered into an amendment to the senior secured credit facility with Oaktree which, among other items, suspended Ashford Trust’s obligation to subordinate fees due under the advisory agreement if at any point there is no accrued interest outstanding or any accrued dividends on any of Ashford Trust’s preferred stock and Ashford 
Trust has sufficient unrestricted cash to repay in full all outstanding loans due under Ashford Trust’s senior secured credit facility. On December 13, 2021, Ashford Trust paid the Company $7.2 million for advisory fees that had been deferred as a result of the $29.0 million annual Advisory Fee Cap. No deferral of base fees or incentive fees occurred in the year ended December 31, 2022.
Payment of Fees. The percentage used to calculate the base fee is now fixed at 0.70% such that the base fee payable on a monthly basis will be an amount equal to 1/12th of the sum of (i) 0.70% of the Total Market Capitalization (as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement) of Ashford Trust for the prior month, plus (ii) the Net Asset Fee Adjustment (as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement), if any, on the last day of the prior month during which the Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement was in effect; provided, however, in no event shall the base fee for any month be less than the Trust Minimum Base Fee (as defined below).
Peer Group. The list of peer group members has been revised to remove certain companies which no longer exist.
Liquidated Damages. Upon a Liquidated Damages Event (as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement) Ashford Trust shall pay to the Company the Liquidated Damages Amount (as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement), which amount, less any outstanding amount owed by the Company to Ashford Trust as a result of a judgment, plus reimbursable costs and expenses, shall be deemed liquidated damages and the parties shall have no further obligations under the Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement.
Consolidated Tangible Net Worth. The requirement that Ashford Trust maintain a minimum Consolidated Tangible Net Worth (as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement) has been suspended until the first fiscal quarter beginning after June 30, 2023.
Officers. The concept of a “Designated CEO” was removed, such that in the event the board of directors of Ashford Trust elects to appoint a chief executive officer who was not an individual made available by the Company pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, such officer made available by the Company will no longer be entitled to any role or responsibilities with Ashford Trust.
Company Change of Control. The sale or disposition by Ashford Trust of assets which would constitute a Company Change of Control was revised in order to provide Ashford Trust additional flexibility to dispose of underperforming assets negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. A Company Change of Control will include, from the date of the Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement (the “Effective Date”) until the first anniversary thereof (which occurred on January 14, 2022), the consummation of a sale of disposition by Ashford Trust of assets constituting 40% of the gross book value of Ashford Trust’s assets, exclusive of assets sold or contributed to a platform also advised by the Company (but including certain assets which were foreclosed upon or otherwise returned to Ashford Trust’s lenders during 2020). In addition, Ashford Trust clarified its existing language such that, commencing after the first anniversary of the Effective Date, the consummation of a sale or disposition by Ashford Trust of assets constituting 20% of the gross book value of Ashford Trust’s assets over any one-year period, or the consummation of a sale or disposition by Ashford Trust of assets constituting 30% of the gross book value of Ashford Trust’s assets over any three-year period, exclusive in each case of assets sold or contributed to a platform also advised by the Company, would constitute a change of control. Additionally, a change in the majority composition of the board of directors of Ashford Trust shall no longer be considered a Company Change of Control.
Design and Construction Fees. Ashford Trust and the Company agreed to cause the master project management agreement (the “Ashford Trust Project Management Agreement”), dated as of August 8, 2018, by and among Ashford Trust TRS, Ashford Trust OP, RI Manchester Tenant Corporation, CY Manchester Tenant Corporation and Premier, to have a 10-year initial term commencing on the Effective Date and shall cause the design and construction and related fees to be paid to Premier thereunder to conform to the predetermined fee schedule attached to the Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement.
Certain additional revisions were made in line with market practice and to more closely reflect the advisory terms between the Company and Ashford Trust.
ERFP Agreements
General. On June 26, 2018, the Company entered into the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement with Ashford Trust. The independent members of the board of directors of each of the Company and Ashford Trust, with the assistance of separate and independent legal counsel, engaged to negotiate the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement on behalf of the Company and Ashford Trust, respectively. On January 15, 2019, the Company entered into the Enhanced Return Funding Program Agreement and Amendment No. 1 to the Fifth Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement (the “Braemar ERFP Agreement” and, together with the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement, the “ERFP Agreements”) with Braemar. Under the ERFP Agreements, the Company agreed to provide $50 million (each, an “Aggregate ERFP Amount” and collectively, the “Aggregate ERFP Amounts”) to each of Ashford Trust and Braemar (collectively, the “REITs”), respectively, in connection with each such REIT’s acquisition of hotels recommended by us, with the option to increase each Aggregate ERFP Amount to up to $100 million upon mutual agreement by the parties to the respective ERFP Agreement. Under each of the ERFP Agreements, the Company will pay each REIT 10% of each acquired hotel’s purchase price in exchange for furniture, fixtures and equipment (“FF&E”) at a property owned by such REIT, which will be subsequently leased by us to such REIT rent-free. Upon expiration of any such rent-free lease, Ashford LLC shall convey the applicable FF&E to the Applicable TRS in exchange for the fair market value thereof, payable in cash by the Applicable TRS. Each of the REITs must provide reasonable advance notice to the Company to request ERFP funds in accordance with the respective ERFP Agreement.
If Ashford Trust OP or Braemar OP, respectively, or their subsidiaries dispose of or cause to be disposed any Enhanced Return Hotel Asset or other real property with respect to which Ashford LLC owns FF&E, including by way of a foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure by a mortgage or mezzanine lender of Ashford Trust OP or Braemar OP, respectively, or their subsidiaries, Ashford Trust or Braemar, as applicable, shall promptly identify, and Ashford LLC shall acquire in exchange for such FF&E, FF&E for use at another real property asset leased by the applicable taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) and with a fair market value equal to the value of such FF&E as established in connection with such disposition.
Ashford Trust’s ERFP Acquisitions. On March 13, 2020, the Company entered into the Extension Agreement (the “Extension Agreement”), related to the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement. Under the terms of the Extension Agreement, the remaining ERFP commitment funding deadline under the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement of $11.4 million in connection with Ashford Trust’s acquisition of The Embassy Suites New York Manhattan Times Square on January 23, 2019, was extended from January 22, 2021 to December 31, 2022. 
 On April 20, 2021, the Company received written notice from Ashford Trust of Ashford Trust’s intention not to renew the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement. As a result, the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement terminated in accordance with its terms on June 26, 2021. The expiration of the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement had no impact on the Extension Agreement which continued in full force. The Company remained obligated to provide Ashford TRS with approximately $11.4 million related to Ashford Trust’s acquisition of the Embassy Suites Manhattan hotel (the “ES Manhattan ERFP Balance”), which such hotel constituted an Enhanced Return Hotel Asset (as defined in the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement). On December 16, 2022, the Company entered into a Side Letter with Ashford TRS and Ashford Trust, pursuant to which the parties agreed that on or before December 16, 2022, the Company will transfer to Ashford Trust all right, title and interest held by the Company and its subsidiaries in the Hilton Atlanta/Marietta Hotel and Conference Center (the “Marietta Hotel”) and, in exchange therefor, Ashford Trust will forgive, cancel and discharge in full the outstanding ES Manhattan ERFP Balance. On December 16, 2022, Ashford TRS entered into an Agreement of Purchase and Sale with Ashford LLC, pursuant to which, effective as of December 16, 2022, Ashford TRS acquired one hundred percent (100%) of the equity interests in (i) Marietta Leasehold LP (the “Lessee”), the lessee of the Marietta Hotel, and (ii) Marietta Leasehold GP LLC, the sole general partner of the Lessee and, in exchange therefor, Ashford Trust forgave, cancelled and discharged in full the outstanding ES Manhattan ERFP Balance.
Braemar’s ERFP Acquisitions. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had no remaining ERFP commitment to Braemar. On November 8, 2021, the Company delivered written notice to Braemar of the Company’s intention not to renew the Braemar ERFP Agreement. As a result, the Braemar ERFP Agreement terminated in accordance with its terms on January 15, 2022. 
Relationship with Ashford Trust and Braemar. We advise both Ashford Trust and Braemar. We are also permitted to have other advisory clients, which may include other REITs operating in the real estate industry or having the same or substantially similar investment guidelines as Ashford Trust or Braemar. If either Ashford Trust or Braemar materially revises its initial investment guidelines without our express written consent, we are required only to use our best judgment to allocate investment opportunities to Braemar, Ashford Trust and other entities we advise, taking into account such factors as we deem relevant, in our discretion, subject to any of our then existing obligations to such other entities. Braemar has agreed not to revise its initial investment guidelines to be directly competitive with Ashford Trust. Ashford Trust agrees, pursuant to the terms of the Ashford Trust advisory agreement, that it will revise its investment guidelines as necessary to avoid direct competition with (i) any entity or platform that Ashford Trust may create or spin-off in the future and (ii) any other entity advised by us, provided that in the case of clause (ii), we and Ashford Trust mutually agree to the terms of such revision of Ashford Trust’s investment 
guidelines. The advisory agreements give each of Ashford Trust and Braemar the right to equitable treatment with respect to other clients of ours, but the advisory agreements do not give any entity the right to preferential treatment, except as follows:
• Any new individual investment opportunities that satisfy Ashford Trust’s investment guidelines will be presented to its board of directors, which has up to 10 business days to accept any such opportunity prior to it being available to Braemar or another business advised by us.
• Any new individual investment opportunities that satisfy Braemar’s investment guidelines will be presented to its board of directors, which has up to 10 business days to accept any such opportunity prior to it being available to Ashford Trust or another business advised by us.
To minimize conflicts between Ashford Trust and Braemar, the advisory agreements require each such entity to designate an investment focus by targeted RevPAR, segments, markets and other factors or financial metrics. After consultation with us, such entity may modify or supplement its investment guidelines from time to time by giving written notice to us; however, if either Ashford Trust or Braemar materially changes its investment guidelines without our express written consent, we are required only to use our best judgment to allocate investment opportunities to Ashford Trust, Braemar and other entities we may advise, taking into account such factors as we deem relevant, in our discretion, subject to any then existing obligations we have to such other entities.
When determining whether an asset satisfies the investment guidelines of either Ashford Trust or Braemar, we must make a good faith determination of projected RevPAR, taking into account historical RevPAR as well as such additional considerations as conversions or reposition of assets, capital plans, brand changes and other factors that may reasonably be forecasted to raise RevPAR after stabilization of such initiative.
If Ashford Trust or Braemar elect to spin-off, carve-out, split-off or otherwise consummate a transfer of a division or subset of assets for the purpose of forming a joint venture, a newly created private platform or a new publicly traded company to hold such division or subset of assets constituting a distinct asset type and/or investment guidelines, Ashford Trust and Braemar have agreed that any such new entity will be advised by us pursuant to an advisory agreement containing substantially the same material terms set forth in our advisory agreement with Ashford Trust or Braemar, as applicable.
Limitations on Liability and Indemnification. The advisory agreements provide that we have no responsibility other than to render the services and take the actions described in the advisory agreements in good faith and with the exercise of due care and are not responsible for any action the board of directors of either Ashford Trust or Braemar takes in following or declining to follow any advice from us. The advisory agreements provide that we, and our officers, directors, managers, employees and members, will not be liable for any act or omission by us (or our officers, directors, managers, employees or members) performed in accordance with and pursuant to the advisory agreements, except by reason of acts constituting gross negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct or reckless disregard of our duties under the applicable advisory agreement.
Each of Ashford Trust and Braemar has agreed to indemnify and hold us harmless (including our partners, directors, officers, stockholders, managers, members, agents, employees and each other person or entity, if any, controlling us) to the full extent lawful, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities of any nature whatsoever with respect to or arising from any acts or omission by us (including ordinary negligence) in our capacity as advisor, except with respect to losses, claims, damages or liabilities with respect to or arising out of our gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct, or reckless disregard of our duties set forth in the applicable advisory agreement (for which we have indemnified Ashford Trust or Braemar, as applicable).
Term and Termination of our Advisory Agreement with Ashford Trust. The term of the advisory agreement with Ashford Trust is 10 years, commencing from the effective date of the Second Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement on January 14, 2021, subject to an extension by the Company for up to seven successive additional 10-year renewal terms thereafter. The board of directors of Ashford Trust will review our performance and fees annually and, following the 10-year initial term, may elect to renegotiate the amount of fees payable under the advisory agreement in certain circumstances. Additionally, if Ashford Trust undergoes a change of control transaction, Ashford Trust will have the right to terminate the advisory agreement with the payment of the termination fee described below. If Ashford Trust terminates the advisory agreement without cause or upon a change of control, Ashford Trust will be required to pay us all fees and expense reimbursements due and owing through the date of termination as well as a termination fee equal to 1.1 times the greater of either:
• 12 multiplied by our Net Earnings for the 12-month period preceding the termination date of the advisory agreement. For purposes of this calculation, “Net Earnings” is defined in the advisory agreement as (A) our reported Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the advisory agreement) attributable to the advisory agreement for the 12-month period preceding the termination of the advisory agreement (adjusted to assume the advisory agreement was in place for the full 12-month period if it otherwise was not), as reported in our earnings releases less (B) our pro forma Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the advisory agreement) assuming the advisory agreement was not in place during such period plus (C) all EBITDA (Net Income (per Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”)) plus interest expenses, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) of ours and any of our affiliates and subsidiaries from providing any service or product to Ashford Trust, its operating partnership or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, exclusive of EBITDA directly resulting from the advisory agreement;
• the earnings multiple (calculated as our total enterprise value divided by our adjusted EBITDA) for our common stock per the 12-month period preceding the termination date multiplied by our Net Earnings (as defined above) for the 12 months preceding the termination; or 
• the simple average of our earnings multiples for the three fiscal years preceding the termination (calculated as our total enterprise value divided by our adjusted EBITDA for such periods) multiplied by our Net Earnings (as defined above) for the 12 months preceding the termination; 
plus, in either case, a gross-up amount for federal and state tax liability, based on an assumed combined tax rate of 40%. Any such termination fee will be payable on or before the termination date.
The Company has agreed that its right to receive fees payable under the advisory agreement, including the termination fee and liquidated damages, shall be subordinate under certain circumstances to the payment in full of obligations under Ashford Trust’s senior secured credit facility with Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (“Oaktree”) and has agreed to enter into documents necessary to subordinate the Company’s interest in such fees. On January 15, 2021, the Company, together with certain affiliated entities, entered into a Subordination and Non-Disturbance Agreement (“SNDA”) pursuant to which the Company agreed to subordinate to the prior repayment in full of all obligations under Ashford Trust’s senior secured credit facility with Oaktree, among other things, (1) advisory fees (other than reimbursable expenses) in excess of 80% of such fees paid during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, and (2) any termination fee or liquidated damages amounts under the advisory agreement, or any amount owed under any enhanced return funding program in connection with the termination of the advisory agreement or sale or foreclosure of assets financed thereunder. On October 12, 2021, Ashford Trust entered into an amendment to the senior secured credit facility with Oaktree which, among other items, suspended Ashford Trust’s obligation to subordinate fees due under the advisory agreement if at any point there is no accrued interest outstanding or any accrued dividends on any of Ashford Trust’s preferred stock and Ashford Trust has sufficient unrestricted cash to repay in full all outstanding loans due under Ashford Trust’s senior secured credit facility.
Ashford Trust may also terminate the advisory agreement at any time, including during the 10-year initial term, without the payment of a termination fee, upon customary events of default and our failure to cure during certain cure periods, such as our default in performance of material obligations, the filing of bankruptcy or a dissolution action and other events, as outlined in the advisory agreement.
Upon any termination of the advisory agreement, we are required to cooperate with and assist Ashford Trust in executing an orderly transition of the management of its assets to a new advisor, providing a full accounting of all accounts held in the name of or on behalf of Ashford Trust, returning any funds held on behalf of Ashford Trust (other than the termination fee escrow account, if applicable) and returning any and all of the books and records of Ashford Trust.
The advisory agreement also provides that if: (i) Ashford Trust enters into a letter of intent or definitive agreement that upon consummation would constitute a change of control; (ii) the Ashford Trust board recommends that Ashford Trust’s stockholders accept a third-party tender offer that would, if consummated, result in a third-party beneficially owning 35% or more of Ashford Trust’s voting stock; or (iii) a third-party otherwise becomes a beneficial owner of 35% or more of Ashford Trust voting stock, then we are entitled to transfer Ashford Trust cash to an escrow account in an amount sufficient to pay the termination fee and other amounts set forth in the advisory agreement.
Base Fees under our Advisory Agreement with Ashford Trust. Ashford Trust is required, on a monthly basis, to pay a fee (the “Base Fee”) in an amount equal to 1/12 of (i) 0.70% of the Total Market Capitalization (as defined below) of Ashford Trust for the prior month, plus (ii) the Net Asset Fee Adjustment (as defined below), if any, on the last day of the prior month during which the advisory agreement was in effect; provided, however in no event shall the Base Fee for any month be less than the Trust Minimum Base Fee (as defined below). 
The “Total Market Capitalization” of Ashford Trust for any period is calculated as:
(a)    to the extent Ashford Trust common stock is listed for trading on a national securities exchange for every day during any period for which the Total Market Capitalization is to be calculated, the amount calculated as:
(i)    the average of the volume-weighted average price per share of common stock for Ashford Trust for each trading day of the period (“Average VWAP”) multiplied by the average number of shares of common stock and common units outstanding during such applicable period, on a fully diluted basis (assuming all common units and long term incentive partnership units in Ashford Trust OP that have achieved economic parity with common units in the applicable operating partnership have been converted into shares of common stock and including any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of any convertible preferred stock where the conversion price is less than Average VWAP), plus
(ii)    the average for the applicable period of the aggregate principal amount of the consolidated indebtedness of Ashford Trust (including its proportionate share of debt of any entity that is not consolidated but excluding its joint venture partners’ proportionate share of consolidated debt), plus 
(iii)    the average for the applicable period of the liquidation value of any outstanding preferred equity of Ashford Trust (excluding any convertible preferred stock where the conversion price is less than Average VWAP).
(b)    to the extent Ashford Trust common stock is not listed for trading on a national securities exchange (due to any reason, including but not limited to delisting by the New York Stock Exchange or the occurrence of a change of control) for any day during any period for which the Total Market Capitalization is to be calculated, the greater of: (i) the weighted average Gross Asset Value of all the Ashford Trust’s assets on each day during such period; or (ii) the Total Market Capitalization as calculated pursuant to paragraph (a) of this definition on the last day on which common stock was listed for trading on a national securities exchange, regardless of whether this day occurred during the applicable period.
“Gross Asset Value” shall mean, with respect to any of Ashford Trust’s assets as of any date, the undepreciated carrying value of all such assets including all cash and cash equivalents and capitalized leases and any property and equipment leased to subsidiaries of Ashford Trust to facilitate the purchase of any Ashford Trust Enhanced Return Hotel Asset (as defined below) as reflected on the most recent balance sheet and accompanying footnotes of Ashford Trust filed with the SEC or prepared by the Company in accordance with GAAP consistent with its performance of its duties under the advisory agreement without giving effect to any impairments plus the publicly disclosed purchase price (excluding any net working capital and transferred property and equipment reserves) of any assets acquired after the date of the most recent balance sheet and all capital expenditures made (to the extent not already reflected in the carrying value of the asset) with respect to an asset since the date of its acquisition for any improvements or for additions thereto, that have a useful life of more than one year and that are required to be capitalized under GAAP.
“Net Asset Fee Adjustment” shall be equal to (i) the product of the Sold Non-ERFP Asset Amount (as more particularly defined in the advisory agreement, but generally equal to the net sales prices of real property (other than any asset the purchase of which was funded in part by the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement (“Ashford Trust Enhanced Return Hotel Assets”)) sold or disposed of after the date of the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement, commencing with and including the first such sale) and 0.70% plus (ii) the product of the Sold ERFP Asset Amount (as more particularly defined in the advisory agreement, but generally equal to the net sales prices of Ashford Trust Enhanced Return Hotel Assets sold or disposed of after the date of the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement, commencing with and including the first such sale) and 1.07%.
The “Trust Minimum Base Fee” for each month beginning January 1, 2021 or thereafter will be equal to the greater of:
(i)    90% of the base fee paid for the same month in the prior year; and
(ii)    1/12th of the “G&A ratio” for the most recently completed fiscal quarter multiplied by the Total Market Capitalization of Ashford Trust on the last balance sheet date included in Ashford Trust’s most recent Form 10-Q or Form 10-K filing.
The “G&A ratio” is calculated as the simple average of the ratios of total general and administrative expenses, including any dead deal costs, less any non-cash expenses, paid in the applicable quarter by each member of a select peer group, divided by the total market capitalization of such peer group member. The peer group for Ashford Trust may be adjusted from time-to-time by mutual agreement between us and a majority of the independent directors of Ashford Trust.
Term and Termination of our Advisory Agreement with Braemar. The initial stated term of the advisory agreement with Braemar is 10 years and will expire, unless otherwise extended or earlier terminated, on January 24, 2027. The advisory agreement with Braemar provides for seven successive additional 10-year renewal terms upon written notice to Braemar, given at least 210 days prior to the expiration of the then-current term. The advisory agreement may be terminated by Braemar, with 
no termination fee due and payable, under the following circumstances: (i) upon our conviction (including a plea or nolo contendere) by a court of competent jurisdiction of a felony; (ii) if we commit an act of fraud against Braemar, convert the funds of Braemar or act in a manner constituting gross negligence in the performance of our material duties under the advisory agreement (including a failure to act); (iii) if we undergo a Bankruptcy Event (as defined in the advisory agreement); or (iv) upon the entry by a court of a final non-appealable order awarding monetary damages to Braemar based on a finding that we committed a material breach or default of a material term, condition, obligation or covenant of the advisory agreement, which breach or default had a material adverse effect.
Upon the closing of a change of control with respect to Braemar (as defined in the advisory agreement), either party may terminate the advisory agreement, and Braemar will be required to pay us all fees and expense reimbursements due and owing through the date of termination as well as a termination fee equal to the greater of:
(i)    12 multiplied by (ii) the sum of (A) our Net Earnings (as defined below) for the 12-month period ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter preceding the termination date of the advisory agreement (“LTM Period”) and (B) to the extent not included in Net Earnings, any incentive fees under the advisory agreement that have accrued or are accelerated but have not yet been paid at the time of termination of the advisory agreement;
(ii) the quotient of (A) our total market capitalization (as defined in the advisory agreement) on the trading day immediately preceding the date of payment of the termination fee, divided by (B) our Adjusted EBITDA for the LTM Period (which for purposes of this paragraph shall include the EBITDA (adjusted on a comparable basis to our Adjusted EBITDA)) for the same LTM Period of any person that we acquired a beneficial ownership interest in during the applicable measurement period, in the same proportion as our beneficial ownership of the acquired person, multiplied by (ii) Net Earnings for the LTM Period plus, to the extent not included in Net Earnings, any incentive fees under the advisory agreement that have accrued or are accelerated but have not yet been paid at the time of termination of the advisory agreement; and
(iii) the simple average, for the three years preceding the fiscal year in which the termination fee is due, of (i) the quotient of (A) our total market capitalization on the trading day immediately preceding the date of payment of the termination fee, divided by (B) our Adjusted EBITDA for the LTM Period multiplied by (ii) Net Earnings for the LTM Period plus, to the extent not included in Net Earnings, any incentive fees under the advisory agreement that have accrued or are accelerated but have not yet been paid at the time of termination of the advisory agreement.
For purposes of this calculation, “Net Earnings” is generally defined in the advisory agreement as (A) the total base fees and incentive fees, plus any other revenues reported on our income statement as pertaining to the advisory agreement (in each case, in accordance with GAAP) including all EBITDA of us and our affiliates and certain of our subsidiaries from providing any additional services to Braemar and its affiliates, less (B) the total incremental expenses determined in accordance with the advisory agreement, in each case for the LTM Period (adjusted assuming (i) the agreement was in place for the full LTM Period if it otherwise was not and (ii) all contracts providing for fees owing to us by Braemar were in place for the full LTM Period if they otherwise were not and all fees payable under such contracts shall be annualized as such). In the event we acquire a beneficial ownership interest in a person that reported on its income statement revenues derived from Braemar, then the revenues received by such acquired person from Braemar for the full LTM Period shall be included within clause (A) of the definition of Net Earnings in the same proportion as our beneficial ownership of the acquired person.
Any such termination fee will be payable on or before the termination date. 
Upon any termination of the advisory agreement, we are required to cooperate with and assist Braemar in executing an orderly transition of the management of its assets to a new advisor, providing a full accounting of all accounts held in the name of or on behalf of such company, returning any funds held on behalf of such company and returning any and all of the books and records of such company. Braemar will be responsible for paying all accrued fees and expenses and will be subject to certain non-solicitation obligations with respect to our employees upon any termination of the applicable advisory agreement other than termination as a result of change of control of our company.
The advisory agreement also provides that if: (a) Braemar enters a letter of intent or definitive agreement that upon consummation would constitute a change of control; (b) the Braemar board recommends that Braemar’s stockholders accept a third-party tender offer that would, if consummated, result in a third-party beneficially owning 35% or more of Braemar’s voting stock; or (c) a third-party otherwise becomes a beneficial owner of 35% or more of Braemar voting stock, then we are entitled to transfer Braemar cash to an escrow account in an amount sufficient to pay the termination fee and other amounts set forth in the advisory agreement.
Base Fees under our Advisory Agreement with Braemar. Braemar is required to pay, on a monthly basis, a fee (the “Base Fee”) in an amount equal to 1/12th of the sum of (i) 0.70% of the Total Market Capitalization (as defined below) of Braemar for the prior month, plus (ii) the Net Asset Fee Adjustment (as defined below), if any, on the last day of the prior month during 
which the advisory agreement was in effect; provided, however, in no event shall the Base Fee for any month be less than the Braemar Minimum Base Fee (as defined below). 
The “Total Market Capitalization” of Braemar for any period is calculated on a monthly basis as follows:
(a)    to the extent Braemar common stock is listed for trading on a national securities exchange for every day during any period for which the Total Market Capitalization is to be calculated, the amount calculated as:
(i)    the average of the volume-weighted average price per share of common stock for Braemar for each trading day of the period (“Average VWAP”) multiplied by the average number of shares of common stock and common units outstanding during such applicable period, on a fully diluted basis (assuming all common units and long term incentive partnership units in the applicable operating partnership which have achieved economic parity with common units in the applicable operating partnership have been converted into shares of common stock and including any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of any convertible preferred stock where the conversion price is less than the Average VWAP), plus
(ii)    the average for the applicable period of the aggregate principal amount of the consolidated indebtedness of Braemar (including its proportionate share of debt of any entity that is not consolidated but excluding its joint venture partners’ proportionate share of consolidated debt), plus
(iii)    the average for the applicable period of the liquidation value of any outstanding preferred equity of Braemar (excluding any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of any convertible preferred stock of Braemar where the conversion price is less than the Average VWAP).
(b)     to the extent Braemar common stock is not listed for trading on a national securities exchange (due to any reason, including but not limited to delisting by the New York Stock Exchange or the occurrence of a change of control) for any day during any period for which the Total Market Capitalization is to be calculated, the greater of: (i) the weighted average Gross Asset Value of all Braemar’s assets on each day during such period; or (ii) the Total Market Capitalization as calculated pursuant to paragraph (a) of this definition on the last day on which common stock was listed for trading on a national securities exchange, regardless of whether this day occurred during the applicable period.
“Gross Asset Value” shall mean, with respect to any of Braemar’s assets as of any date, the undepreciated carrying value of all such assets including all cash and cash equivalents and capitalized leases and any property and equipment leased to subsidiaries of Braemar to facilitate the purchase of any Enhanced Return Hotel Asset as reflected on the most recent balance sheet and accompanying footnotes of Braemar filed with the SEC or prepared by the Advisor in accordance with GAAP consistent with its performance of its duties under the advisory agreement without giving effect to any impairments plus the publicly disclosed purchase price (excluding any net working capital and transferred property and equipment reserves) of any assets acquired after the date of the most recent balance sheet and all capital expenditures made (to the extent not already reflected in the carrying value of the asset) with respect to an asset since the date of its acquisition for any improvements or for additions thereto, that have a useful life of more than one year and that are required to be capitalized under GAAP.
“Net Asset Fee Adjustment” shall be equal to (i) the product of the Sold Non-ERFP Asset Amount (as more particularly defined in the advisory agreement, but generally equal to the net sales prices of real property (other than any Enhanced Return Hotel Assets) sold or disposed of after the date of the ERFP Agreement, commencing with and including the first such sale) and 0.70% plus (ii) the product of the Sold ERFP Asset Amount (as more particularly defined in the advisory agreement, but generally equal to the net sales prices of Enhanced Return Hotel Assets sold or disposed of after the date of the ERFP Agreement, commencing with and including the first such sale) and 1.07%.
The “Braemar Minimum Base Fee” for each month will be equal to the greater of:
(i)    90% of the base fee paid for the same month in the prior year; or
(ii)    1/12th of the “G&A ratio” for the most recently completed fiscal quarter multiplied by the total market capitalization of Braemar on the last balance sheet date included in Braemar’s most recent Form 10-Q or Form 10-K filing.
The “G&A ratio” is calculated as the simple average of the ratios of total general and administrative expenses, including any dead deal costs, less any non-cash expenses, paid in the applicable fiscal quarter by each member of a select peer group, divided by the total market capitalization of such peer group member. The peer group for each company may be adjusted from time to time by mutual agreement between us and a majority of the independent directors of Braemar. Each month’s base fee is determined based on prior month results and is payable in cash on the fifth business day of the month for which the fee is applied.
Incentive Fee under the Advisory Agreements with Ashford Trust and Braemar. Incentive advisory fees are measured annually in each year that Ashford Trust’s and/or Braemar’s annual total stockholder return (“TSR”) exceeds the average annual total stockholder return for each company’s respective peer group, subject to the FCCR Condition, as defined in the advisory agreements. Incentive advisory fees are paid over a three-year period and each payment is subject to the FCCR Condition. For purposes of this calculation, Ashford Trust’s TSR is calculated using a year-end stock price equal to the closing price of its common stock on the last trading day of the year as compared to the closing stock price of its common stock on the last trading day of the prior year, in each case assuming all dividends on the common stock during such period are reinvested into additional shares of common stock of Ashford Trust on the day such dividends are paid. Braemar’s TSR is calculated as the sum, expressed as a percentage, of: (A) the change in the Braemar common stock price during the applicable period; plus (B) the dividend yield paid during the applicable period (determined by dividing dividends paid during the applicable period by Braemar’s common stock price at the beginning of the applicable period and including the value of any dividends or distributions with respect to Braemar common stock not paid in cash valued in the reasonable discretion of Ashford LLC). The average TSR for each member of such company’s peer group is calculated in the same manner and for the same time period, and the simple average for the entire peer group is used.
The annual incentive fee is calculated as (i) 5% of the amount (expressed as a percentage but in no event greater than 25%) by which the annual TSR of Ashford Trust or Braemar, as applicable, exceeds the average TSR for its respective peer group, multiplied by (ii) the fully diluted equity value of such company at December 31 of the applicable year. To determine the fully diluted equity value, we assume that all units in the operating partnership of Ashford Trust or Braemar, as applicable, including Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) units that have achieved economic parity with the common units, if any, converted into common stock and that the per share value of each share of common stock of such company is equal to the closing price of its stock on the last trading day of the year. The incentive fee, if any, that is subject to the FCCR Condition, is payable in arrears in three equal annual installments with the first installment payable on January 15 following the applicable year for which the incentive fee relates and on January 15 of the next two successive years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon any termination of the advisory agreement for any reason, any unpaid incentive fee (including any incentive fee as measured for the stub period ending on the termination date) will become fully earned and immediately due and payable without regard to the FCCR Condition. Except in the case when the incentive fee is payable on the date of termination of this Agreement, up to 50% of the incentive fee may be paid by each Ashford Trust or Braemar, at the option of such entity, in shares of its common stock or common units of the applicable operating partnership of such entity, with the balance payable in cash, unless at the time for payment of the incentive fee:
(i)    we or our affiliates own common stock or common units in an amount (determined with reference to the closing price of the common stock of each Ashford Trust or Braemar, as applicable, on the last trading day of the year) greater than or equal to three times the base fee for the preceding four quarters,
(ii)    payment in such securities would cause us to be subject to the provisions of the Investment Company Act, or
(iii)    payment in such securities would not be legally permissible for any reason; in which case, the entire Incentive Fee will be paid by Ashford Trust or Braemar in cash.
Upon the determination of the incentive fee, except in the case of any termination of the advisory agreement in which case the incentive fee for the stub period and all unpaid installments of an incentive fee shall be deemed earned by us and fully due and payable by Ashford Trust and Braemar, as applicable, each one-third installment of the incentive fee shall not be deemed earned by us or otherwise payable by Ashford Trust or Braemar, as applicable, unless such entity, as of the December 31 immediately preceding the due date for the payment of the incentive fee installment, has met the FCCR Condition requiring an FCCR of 0.20x or greater. For purposes of this calculation, FCCR is the ratio of adjusted EBITDA for the previous four consecutive fiscal quarters to fixed charges, which includes all (i) such entity and its subsidiaries’ interest expense, (ii) such entity and its subsidiaries’ regularly scheduled principal payments, other than balloon or similar principal payments which repay indebtedness in full and payments under cash flow mortgages applied to principal and (iii) preferred dividends paid by such entity.
Equity Compensation. To incentivize our employees, officers, consultants, non-employee directors, affiliates and representatives to achieve the goals and business objectives of each of Ashford Trust and Braemar, as established by the boards of directors of such entities, in addition to the base fee and the incentive fee described above, the boards of directors of each of Ashford Trust and Braemar have the authority to make annual equity awards and, during the first and second fiscal quarters of calendar years 2022 and 2023, cash incentive compensation directly to our employees, officers, consultants and non-employee directors, based on achievement of certain financial and other objectives established by such board of directors.
Expense Reimbursement. We are responsible for all wages, salaries, cash bonus payments and benefits related to our employees providing services to Ashford Trust or Braemar (including any of the officers of Ashford Trust or Braemar who are 
also officers or employees of our company), with the exception of any equity compensation and, during the first and second fiscal quarters of calendar years 2022 and 2023, cash incentive compensation that may be awarded by Ashford Trust or Braemar to our employees. We are also responsible for the provision of certain internal audit, asset management and risk management services and the international office expenses described below. Ashford Trust and Braemar are each responsible to pay or reimburse us monthly for all other costs we incur on behalf of such entities or in connection with the performance of our services and duties to such companies, including, without limitation, tax, legal, accounting, advisory, investment banking and other third-party professional fees, director fees, insurance (including errors and omissions insurance and any other insurance required pursuant to the terms of the advisory agreements), debt service, taxes, underwriting, brokerage, reporting, registration, listing fees and charges, travel and entertainment expenses, conference sponsorships, transaction diligence and closing costs, dead deal costs, dividends, office space, the cost of all equity awards or compensation plans established by such companies, including the value of awards made by companies to our employees, and any other costs which are reasonably necessary for the performance by us of our duties and functions, including any expenses incurred by us to comply with new or revised laws or governmental rules or regulations that impose additional duties on Ashford Trust or Braemar or us in our capacity as advisor to such entities. In addition, each of Ashford Trust and Braemar pays a pro rata share of our office overhead and administrative expenses incurred in the performance of our duties and functions under the advisory agreements. There is no specific limitation on the amount of such reimbursements.
In addition to the expenses described above, each of Ashford Trust and Braemar are required to reimburse us monthly for its pro rata share (as reasonably agreed to between us and a majority of the independent directors of such company or its audit committee, chairman of its audit committee or lead director) of all reasonable international office expenses, overhead, personnel costs, travel and other costs directly related to our non-executive personnel who are located internationally or that oversee the operations of international assets or related to our personnel that source, investigate or provide diligence services in connection with possible acquisitions or investments internationally. Such expenses include but are not limited to, salary, wages, payroll taxes and the cost of employee benefit plans. We also pay for the costs associated with Ashford Trust’s current chairman emeritus, which includes a $700,000 annual stipend and the cost of all benefits currently available to him, as well as reimbursement for reasonable expenses incurred by him in connection with his service to Ashford Trust. 
Additional Services. If, and to the extent that, either Ashford Trust or Braemar requests us to render services on behalf of such company other than those required to be rendered by us under the advisory agreement, including, but not limited to, certain services provided by Ashford Services, such additional services will be compensated separately, at market rates, as defined in the advisory agreements.
The Ashford Trademark. We have a proprietary interest in the “Ashford” trademark, and we agreed to license its use to each of Ashford Trust and Braemar. If at any time Ashford Trust or Braemar ceases to retain us to perform advisory services for them, within 60 days following receipt of written request from us, such entity must cease to conduct business under or use the “Ashford” name or logo, as well as change its name and the names of any of its subsidiaries to a name that does not contain the name “Ashford.”
Our Hotel Management Agreements, Project Management Agreements and Mutual Exclusivity Agreements with each of Ashford Trust and Braemar
Ashford Trust Hotel Management Agreement 
General. Remington has a master hotel management agreement with Ashford Trust (the “Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement.”) Pursuant to the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement, Remington manages 68 of Ashford Trust’s 100 hotel properties and WorldQuest as of December 31, 2022. The Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement will also govern the management of hotels Ashford Trust acquires in the future that are managed by Remington, which has the right to manage and operate hotel properties Ashford Trust acquires in the future unless Ashford Trust’s independent directors either (i) unanimously elect not to engage Remington, or (ii) by a majority vote, elect not to engage Remington because they have determined, in their reasonable business judgment, (A) special circumstances exist such that it would be in Ashford Trust’s best interest not to engage Remington for the particular hotel, or (B) based on the prior performance of Remington, another manager could perform the management duties materially better than Remington for the particular hotel. See “Our Hotel Management Agreements, Project Management Agreements and Mutual Exclusivity Agreements with each of Ashford Trust and Braemar—Ashford Trust Hotel Management Mutual Exclusivity Agreement-—Exclusivity Rights of Remington.” 
Term. The Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement provides for an initial term of 10 years as to each hotel governed by the agreement. The term may be renewed by Remington, at its option, subject to certain performance tests, for three successive periods of seven years each and, thereafter, a final term of four years, provided that at the time the option to renew is exercised, Remington is not then in default under the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement. If at the 
time of the exercise of any renewal period, Remington is in default, then the exercise of the renewal option will be conditional on timely cure of such default, and if such default is not timely cured, then Ashford Trust’s TRS lessee may terminate the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement regardless of the exercise of such option and without the payment of any fee or liquidated damages. If Remington desires to exercise any option to renew, it must give Ashford Trust’s TRS lessee written notice of its election to renew the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement no less than 90 days before the expiration of the then-current term of the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement.
Amounts Payable under the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement. Remington receives a base management fee, and if the hotels meet and exceed certain thresholds, an additional incentive fee. The base management fee for each hotel will be due monthly and will be equal to the greater of:
•$16,294 (increased annually based on consumer price index adjustments); or
•3% of the gross revenues associated with that hotel for the related month.
The incentive management fee, if any, for each hotel will be due annually in arrears within 90 days of the end of the fiscal year and will be equal to the lesser of (i) 1% of gross revenues and (ii) the amount by which the actual house profit (gross operating profit of the applicable hotel before deducting management fees or franchise fees) exceeds the target house profit as set forth in the annual operating budget approved for the applicable fiscal year, except with respect to hotels where Remington takes over management upon acquisition by Ashford Trust, in which case, for the first five years, the incentive management fee to be paid to Remington, if any, is the amount by which the hotel’s actual house profit exceeds the projected house profit for such calendar year as set forth in our acquisition pro forma. If, however, based on actual operations and revised forecasts from time to time, it is reasonably anticipated that the incentive fee is reasonably expected to be earned, the TRS lessee will consider payment of the incentive fee pro rata on a quarterly basis.
The incentive fee is designed to encourage Remington to generate higher house profit at each hotel by increasing the fee due to Remington when the hotels generate house profit above certain threshold levels. Any increased revenues should generate increased lease payments under the percentage leases and should thereby benefit our stockholders.
Termination. The Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement may be terminated as to one or more of the hotels earlier than the stated term if certain events occur, including:
•a sale of a hotel;
•the failure of Remington to satisfy certain performance standards;
•for the convenience of Ashford Trust’s TRS lessee;
•in the event of a casualty to, condemnation of, or force majeure involving a hotel; or
•upon a default by Remington or Ashford Trust that is not cured prior to the expiration of any applicable cure periods.
In certain cases of early termination of the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement with respect to one or more of the hotels, Ashford Trust must pay Remington termination fees, plus any amounts otherwise due to Remington pursuant to the terms of the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement. Ashford Trust will be obligated to pay termination fees in the circumstances described below, provided that Remington is not then in default, subject to certain cure and grace periods:
Sale. If any hotel subject to the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement is sold during the first 12 months of the date such hotel becomes subject to the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement, Ashford Trust’s TRS lessee may terminate the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement with respect to such sold hotel, provided that it pays to Remington an amount equal to the management fee (both base fees and incentive fees) estimated to be payable to Remington with respect to the applicable hotel pursuant to the then-current annual operating budget for the balance of the first year of the term. If any hotel subject to the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement is sold at any time after the first year of the term and the TRS lessee terminates the master management agreement with respect to such hotel, Ashford Trust’s TRS lessee will have no obligation to pay any termination fees.
Casualty. If any hotel subject to the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement is the subject of a casualty during the first year of the initial 10-year term and the TRS lessee elects not to rebuild, then Ashford Trust must pay to Remington the termination fee, if any, that would be owed if the hotel had been sold. However, after the first year of the initial 10-year term, if a hotel is the subject of a casualty and the TRS lessee elects not to rebuild the hotel even though sufficient casualty insurance proceeds are available to do so, then the TRS lessee must pay to Remington a termination fee equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) 65% of the aggregate management fees (both base fees and incentive fees) estimated to be paid to Remington 
with respect to the applicable hotel pursuant to the then-current annual operating budget (but in no event less than the management fees for the preceding full fiscal year) by (ii) nine.
Condemnation or Force Majeure. In the event of a condemnation of, or the occurrence of any force majeure event with respect to, any of the hotels, the TRS lessee has no obligation to pay any termination fees if the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement terminates as to those hotels.
Failure to Satisfy Performance Test. If any hotel subject to the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement fails to satisfy a certain performance test, the TRS lessee may terminate the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement after the base 10 year term of the Ashford Trust hotel management agreement applicable to and with respect to such hotel, and in such case, the TRS lessee must pay to Remington an amount equal to 60% of the product obtained by multiplying (i) 65% of the aggregate management fees (both base fees and incentive fees) estimated to be paid to Remington with respect to the applicable hotel pursuant to the then-current annual operating budget (but in no event less than the management fees for the preceding full fiscal year) by (ii) nine. Remington will have failed the performance test with respect to a particular hotel if during any fiscal year during the term (i) such hotel’s gross operating profit margin for such fiscal year is less than 75% of the average gross operating profit margins of comparable hotels in similar markets and geographical locations, as reasonably determined by Remington and the TRS lessee, and (ii) such hotel’s RevPAR yield penetration is less than 80%. Upon a performance test failure, the TRS lessee must give Remington two years to cure. If, after the first year, the performance test failure has not been cured, then the TRS lessee may, in order not to waive any such failure, require Remington to engage a consultant with significant hotel lodging experience reasonably acceptable to both Remington and the TRS lessee, to make a determination as to whether or not another management company could manage the hotel in a materially more efficient manner. If the consultant’s determination is in the affirmative, then Remington must engage such consultant to assist with the cure of such performance failure for the second year of the cure period after that failure. If the consultant’s determination is in the negative, then Remington will be deemed not to be in default under the performance test. The cost of such consultant will be shared by the TRS lessee and Remington equally. If Remington fails the performance test for the second year of the cure period and, after that failure, the consultant again makes a finding that another management company could manage the hotel in a materially more efficient manner than Remington, then the TRS lessee has the right to terminate the Ashford Trust hotel management agreement after the base 10 year term of the Ashford Trust hotel management agreement applicable to and with respect to such hotel upon 45 days’ written notice to Remington and to pay to Remington the termination fee described above. Further, if any hotel subject to the Ashford Trust hotel management agreement is within a cure period due to a failure of the performance test, an exercise of a renewal option shall be conditioned upon timely cure of the performance test failure, and if the performance failure is not timely cured, the TRS lessee may elect to terminate the Ashford Trust Hotel Management Agreement after the base 10 year term of the Ashford Trust Hotel Management Agreement applicable to and with respect to such hotel without paying any termination fee.
For Convenience. With respect to any hotel managed by Remington pursuant to the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement, if the TRS lessee elects for convenience to terminate the management of such hotel, at any time, including during any renewal term, the TRS lessee must pay a termination fee to Remington, equal to the product of (i) 65% of the aggregate management fees for such hotel (both base fees and incentive fees) estimated to be payable to Remington with respect to the applicable hotel pursuant to the then-current annual operating budget (but in no event less than the management fees for the preceding full fiscal year) and (ii) nine.
If the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement terminates as to all of the hotels covered in connection with a default under the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement, the Ashford Trust hotel management MEA (as defined below) can also be terminated at the non-defaulting party’s election. See “Our Hotel Management Agreements, Project Management Agreements and Mutual Exclusivity Agreements with each of Ashford Trust and Braemar—Ashford Trust Hotel Management Mutual Exclusivity Agreement with Remington.”
Maintenance and Modifications. Remington must maintain each hotel in good repair and condition and make such routine maintenance, repairs and minor alterations as it deems reasonably necessary. The cost of all such routine maintenance, repairs and alterations will be paid by the TRS lessee. All non-routine repairs and maintenance, either to a hotel or its property and equipment pursuant to the capital improvement budget described below, will be managed by Premier pursuant to the Ashford Trust Project Management Agreement.
Insurance. Remington must coordinate with the TRS lessee the procurement and maintenance of all workers’ compensation, employer’s liability and other appropriate and customary insurance related to its operations as a hotel manager, the cost of which is the responsibility of the TRS lessee.
Assignment and Subleasing. Neither Remington nor the TRS lessee may assign or transfer the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement without the other party’s prior written consent. However, Remington may assign its rights and 
obligations to an affiliate that satisfies the eligible independent contractor requirements and is “controlled” by Mr. Monty J. Bennett, his father Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr., or their respective family partnerships or trusts, the sole members or beneficiaries of which are at all times lineal descendants of Messrs. Monty J. Bennett or Archie Bennett, Jr. (including step children) and spouses. “Controlled” means (i) the possession of a majority of the capital stock (or ownership interest) and voting power of such affiliate, directly or indirectly, or (ii) the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such affiliate in the capacity of chief executive officer, president, chairman, or other similar capacity where they are actively engaged or involved in providing such direction or control and spend a substantial amount of time managing such affiliate. No assignment will release Remington from any of its obligations under the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement.
Damage to Hotels. If any of our insured properties is destroyed or damaged, the TRS lessee is obligated, subject to the requirements of the underlying lease, to repair or replace the damaged or destroyed portion of the hotel to the same condition as existed prior to such damage or destruction. If the lease relating to such damaged hotel is terminated pursuant to the terms of the lease, the TRS lessee has the right to terminate the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement with respect to such damaged hotel upon 60 days’ written notice. In the event of a termination, neither the TRS lessee nor Remington will have any further liabilities or obligations under the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement with respect to such damaged hotel, except that Ashford Trust may be obligated to pay to Remington a termination fee, as described above. If the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement remains in effect with respect to such damaged hotel, and the damage does not result in a reduction of gross revenues at the hotel, the TRS lessee’s obligation to pay management fees will be unabated. If, however, the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement remains in effect with respect to such damaged hotel, but the damage does result in a reduction of gross revenues at the hotel, the TRS lessee will be entitled to partial, pro rata abatement of the management fees while the hotel is being repaired.
Condemnation of a Property or Force Majeure. If all or substantially all of a hotel is subject to a total condemnation or a partial taking that prevents use of the property as a hotel, the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement, with respect to such hotel, will terminate, subject to the requirements of the applicable lease. In the event of termination, neither the TRS lessee nor Remington will have any further rights, remedies, liabilities or obligations under the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement with respect to such hotel. If any partial taking of a property does not make it unreasonable to continue to operate the hotel, there is no right to terminate the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement. If there is an event of force majeure or any other cause beyond the control of Remington that directly involves a hotel and has a significant adverse effect upon the continued operations of that hotel, then the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement may be terminated by the TRS lessee. In the event of such a termination, neither the TRS lessee nor Remington will have any further rights, remedies, liabilities or obligations under the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement with respect to such hotel.
Annual Operating Budget. The Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement provides that not less than 45 days prior to the beginning of each fiscal year during the term of the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement, Remington will submit to the TRS lessee for each of the hotels, an annual operating budget setting forth in detail an estimated profit and loss statement for each of the next 12 months (or for the balance of the fiscal year in the event of a partial first fiscal year), including a schedule of hotel room rentals and other rentals and a marketing and business plan for each of the hotels. The budget is subject to the TRS lessee approval, which may not be unreasonably withheld. The budget may be revised from time to time, taking into account such circumstances as the TRS lessee deems appropriate or as business and operating conditions shall demand, subject to the reasonable approval of Remington.
Capital Improvement Budget. Remington must prepare a capital improvement budget of the expenditures necessary for replacement of property and equipment and building repairs for the hotels during the following fiscal year and provide such budget to the relevant TRS lessee and landlord for approval at the same time Remington submits the proposed annual operating budget for approval by TRS lessee. Remington may not make any other expenditures for these items without the relevant TRS lessee and landlord approval, except expenditures which are provided in the capital improvements budget or are required by reason of any (i) emergency, (ii) applicable legal requirements, (iii) the terms of any franchise agreement or (iv) are otherwise required for the continued safe and orderly operation of Ashford Trust’s hotels.
Indemnity Provisions. Remington has agreed to indemnify the TRS lessee against all damages not covered by insurance that arise from: (i) the fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence of Remington subject to certain limitations; (ii) infringement by Remington of any third-party’s intellectual property rights; (iii) employee claims based on a substantial violation by Remington of employment laws or that are a direct result of the corporate policies of Remington; (iv) the knowing or reckless placing, discharge, leakage, use or storage of hazardous materials in violation of applicable environmental laws on or in any of our hotels by Remington; or (v) the breach by Remington of the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement, including action taken by Remington beyond the scope of its authority under the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement, which is not cured.
Except to the extent indemnified by Remington as described in the preceding paragraph, the TRS lessee will indemnify Remington against all damages not covered by insurance and that arise from: (i) the performance of Remington’s services under the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement; (ii) the condition or use of Ashford Trust’s hotels; (iii) certain liabilities to which Remington is subjected, including pursuant to the WARN Act, in connection with the termination of the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement; (iv) all employee cost and expenses; or (v) any claims made by an employee of Remington against Remington that are based on a violation or alleged violation of the employment laws.
Events of Default. Events of default under the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement include:
•The TRS lessee or Remington files a voluntary bankruptcy petition, or experiences a bankruptcy-related event not discharged within 90 days.
•The TRS lessee or Remington fails to make any payment due under the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement, subject to a 10-day notice and cure period.
•The TRS lessee or Remington fails to observe or perform any other term of the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement, subject to a 30-day notice and cure period. There are certain instances in which the 30-day notice and cure period can be extended to up to 120 days.
•Remington does not qualify as an “eligible independent contractor” as such term is defined in Section 856(d)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code.
If an event of default occurs and continues beyond any grace period, the non-defaulting party will have the option of terminating the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement, on 30 days’ notice to the other party.
To minimize conflicts between Ashford Trust and Remington on matters arising under the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement, Ashford Trust’s Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that any waiver, consent, approval, modification, enforcement matters or elections which Ashford Trust may make pursuant to the terms of the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement shall be within the exclusive discretion and control of a majority of the independent members of the board of directors (or higher vote thresholds specifically set forth in such agreements). In addition, Ashford Trust’s board of directors has established a Related Party Transaction Committee comprised solely of independent members of Ashford Trust’s board of directors to review all related party transactions that involve conflicts. The Related Party Transaction Committee may make recommendations to the independent members of Ashford Trust’s board of directors (including rejection of any proposed transaction). All related party transactions are approved by either the Related Party Transaction Committee or the independent members of Ashford Trust’s board of directors.
Ashford Trust Hotel Management Mutual Exclusivity Agreement
General. Remington has a mutual exclusivity agreement with Ashford Trust (the “Ashford Trust hotel management MEA”) which gives Ashford Trust a first right of refusal to purchase any lodging-related investments identified by Remington and any of its affiliates that meet Ashford Trust’s initial investment criteria, and Ashford Trust agrees to engage Remington to provide hotel management for hotels Ashford Trust acquired or invested in, to the extent that Ashford Trust has the right or control the right to direct such matters.
Term. The initial term of the Ashford Trust hotel management MEA is 10 years from November 19, 2013. This term automatically extends for three additional renewal periods of seven years each and a final renewal period of four years, for a total of up to 35 years. The agreement may be sooner terminated because of:
•an event of default (see “Events of Default”);
•a party’s early termination rights (see “Early Termination”); or
•a termination of all the Ashford Trust master hotel management agreements between TRS lessee and Remington because of an event of default under the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement that affects all properties (see “Relationship with Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement”).
Modification of Investment Guidelines. In the event that Ashford Trust materially modifies its initial investment guidelines without the written consent of Remington, which consent may be withheld at its sole and absolute discretion, and may further be subject to the consent of Braemar, Remington will have no obligation to present or offer Ashford Trust investment opportunities at any time thereafter. Instead, Remington, subject to the superior rights of Braemar or any other party with which Remington may have an existing agreement, shall use their reasonable discretion to determine how to allocate investment opportunities it identifies. In the event Ashford Trust materially modifies its investment guidelines without the 
written consent of Remington, Braemar will have superior rights to investment opportunities identified by Remington, and Ashford Trust will no longer retain preferential treatment to investment opportunities identified by Remington. A material modification for this purpose means any modification of Ashford Trust’s initial investment guidelines to be competitive with Braemar’s investment guidelines.
Our Exclusivity Rights. Remington and Mr. Monty J. Bennett have granted Ashford Trust a first right of refusal to pursue certain lodging investment opportunities identified by Remington or its affiliates (including Mr. Bennett), including opportunities to buy hotel properties, to buy land and build hotels, or to otherwise invest in hotel properties that satisfy Ashford Trust’s initial investment guidelines and are not considered excluded transactions pursuant to the Ashford Trust hotel management MEA. If investment opportunities are identified and are subject to the Ashford Trust hotel management MEA, and Ashford Trust has not materially modified its initial investment guidelines without the written consent of Remington, then Remington Lodging, Mr. Bennett and their affiliates, as the case may be, will not pursue those opportunities (except as described below) and will give Ashford Trust a written notice and description of the investment opportunity, and Ashford Trust will have 10 business days to either accept or reject the investment opportunity. If Ashford Trust rejects the opportunity, Remington may then pursue such investment opportunity, subject to a right of first refusal in favor of Braemar pursuant to an existing agreement between Braemar and Remington, on materially the same terms and conditions as offered to Ashford Trust. If the terms of such investment opportunity materially change, then Remington must offer the revised investment opportunity to Ashford Trust, whereupon Ashford Trust will have 10 business days to either accept or reject the opportunity on the revised terms.
Reimbursement of Costs. If Ashford Trust accepts an investment opportunity from Remington, Ashford Trust will be obligated to reimburse Remington or its affiliates for the actual out-of-pocket and third-party costs and expenses paid by Remington or its affiliates in connection with such investment opportunity, including any earnest money deposits, but excluding any finder’s fee, brokerage fee, development fee or other compensation paid by Remington or its affiliates. Remington must submit to Ashford Trust an accounting of the costs in reasonable detail.
Exclusivity Rights of Remington. If Ashford Trust elects to pursue an investment opportunity that consists of the management and operation of a hotel property or acquisition of debt, or making of a loan, with respect to such hotel property, Ashford Trust will hire Remington to provide such services unless Ashford Trust’s independent directors either (i) unanimously elect not to engage Remington, or (ii) by a majority vote, elect not to engage Remington because they have determined, in their reasonable business judgment, (A) special circumstances exist such that it would be in Ashford Trust’s best interest not to engage Remington for the particular hotel, or (B) based on the prior performance of Remington, another manager or developer could perform the management duties materially better than Remington for the particular hotel. In return, Remington has agreed that it will provide those services.
Excluded Investment Opportunities. The following are excluded from the Ashford Trust hotel management MEA and are not subject to any exclusivity rights or right of first refusal:
•With respect to Remington, an investment opportunity where Ashford Trust’s independent directors have unanimously voted not to engage Remington as the manager or developer.
•With respect to Remington, an investment opportunity where Ashford Trust’s independent directors, by a majority vote, have elected not to engage Remington as the manager or developer based on their determination, in their reasonable business judgment, that special circumstances exist such that it would be in Ashford Trust’s best interest not to engage Remington with respect to the particular hotel.
•With respect to Remington, an investment opportunity where Ashford Trust’s independent directors, by a majority vote, have elected not to engage Remington as the manager or developer because they have determined, in their reasonable business judgment, that another manager or developer could perform the management, development or other duties materially better than Remington for the particular hotel, based on Remington’s prior performance.
•Existing hotel investments of Remington or its affiliates with any of their existing joint venture partners, investors or property owners.
•Existing bona fide arm’s length third-party management arrangements (or arrangements for other services) of Remington or any of its affiliates with third parties other than Ashford Trust and its affiliates.
•Like-kind exchanges made pursuant to existing contractual obligations by any of the existing joint venture partners, investors or property owners in which Remington or its affiliates have an ownership interest, provided that Remington provides Ashford Trust with notice 10 days prior to such transaction.
Management or Development. If Ashford Trust hires Remington to manage or operate a hotel, it will be pursuant to the terms of the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement agreed to between Ashford Trust and Remington.
Events of Default. Each of the following is a default under the Ashford Trust hotel management MEA:
•Ashford Trust or Remington experience a bankruptcy-related event;
•Ashford Trust fails to reimburse Remington as described under “Reimbursement of Costs,” subject to a 30-day cure period; and
•Ashford Trust or Remington does not observe or perform any other term of the agreement, subject to a 30-day cure period (which may be increased to a maximum of 120 days in certain instances).
If a default occurs, the non-defaulting party will have the option of terminating the Ashford Trust hotel management MEA subject to 30 days’ written notice and pursuing its rights and remedies under applicable law.
Early Termination. Remington has the right to terminate the exclusivity rights granted to Ashford Trust if:
•Mr. Monty J. Bennett is removed without cause as chairman of Ashford Trust’s board of directors or is not re-appointed to such position, or he resigns as chairman of its board of directors for good reason or as a result of a change of control, or the employment agreement of Mr. Monty J. Bennett with the Company is not renewed;
•Mr. Archie Bennett Jr. is removed as Chairman Emeritus or Ashford Trust breaches the Chairman Emeritus Agreement dated January 7, 2013;
•upon expiration of the non-compete restrictions contained in the employment agreement of Mr. Monty J. Bennett;
•Mr. Monty J. Bennett is no longer chairman of the board of Ashford Trust and subject to the non-compete restrictions in his employment agreement, and three times in any fiscal year during the term of the Ashford Trust hotel management MEA, in any combination of the following: (i) Ashford Trust’s independent directors elect not to pursue a Remington transaction (as specified in the Ashford Trust hotel management MEA) or elect not to engage Remington with respect to the management opportunities part of a Remington transaction which Ashford Trust has elected to pursue pursuant to the Ashford Trust hotel management MEA, or (ii) Ashford Trust fails to close on a Remington transaction presented to Ashford Trust, and the failure to close is caused by an Ashford Trust affiliate; or
•Ashford Trust terminates the Remington exclusivity rights pursuant to the terms of the Ashford Trust hotel management MEA.
Ashford Trust may terminate the exclusivity rights granted to Remington if:
•Remington fails to qualify as an “eligible independent contractor” as defined in Section 856(d)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and for that reason, Ashford Trust terminates the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement with Remington;
•If Mr. Monty J. Bennett resigns as chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors of Ashford Trust without good reason or if Mr. Monty J. Bennett’s employment agreement with the Company is terminated for cause;
•Ashford Trust experiences a change in control provided that Ashford Trust first pays to Remington the termination fees payable in connection with a termination for convenience pursuant to the Ashford Trust hotel management MEA; and
•Remington terminates Ashford Trust’s exclusivity rights pursuant to the terms of the Ashford Trust hotel management MEA or the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement for all of the properties then covered.
Assignment. The Ashford Trust hotel management MEA may not be assigned by any of the parties without the prior written consent of the other parties, provided that Remington can assign its interest in the Ashford Trust hotel management MEA, without the written consent of the other parties, to a “manager affiliate entity” as that term is defined in the agreement, so long as such affiliate qualifies as an “eligible independent contractor” at the time of such transfer.
Relationship with Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement. The rights provided to Ashford Trust and to Remington in the Ashford Trust hotel management MEA may be terminated if the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement between Ashford Trust and Remington terminates in its entirety because of an event of default as to all of the then-managed properties. A termination of Remington’s management rights with respect to one or more hotels (but not all hotels) does not terminate the Ashford Trust hotel management MEA. A termination of the Ashford Trust hotel management MEA does not terminate the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement either in part or in whole, and the Ashford Trust Master Hotel Management Agreement would continue in accordance with its terms as to the hotels covered, despite a termination of the Ashford Trust hotel management MEA.
Ashford Trust Project Management Agreement 
Pursuant to our Ashford Trust Project Management Agreement, Ashford TRS Corporation, a subsidiary of Ashford Trust OP, and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “Ashford Trust TRS”) has appointed Premier as its sole, exclusive and continuing manager to manage, coordinate, plan and execute the capital improvement budget and all major repositionings of hotels owned or leased by Ashford Trust TRS (collectively, “Ashford Trust Hotels”) and to provide construction management, interior design, architectural, property and equipment purchasing, property and equipment expediting/freight management, property and equipment warehousing, and property and equipment installation and supervision services (collectively, “Project Services”).
The Ashford Trust Project Management Agreement provides that Premier shall be paid a design and construction fee equal to four percent of the total project costs associated with the implementation of the capital improvement budget (both hard and soft) payable monthly in arrears based upon the prior calendar month’s total expenditures under the capital improvement budget until such time that the capital improvement budget and/or renovation project involves the expenditure of an amount in excess of five percent of the gross revenues of the applicable Ashford Trust Hotel, whereupon the design and construction fee shall be reduced to three percent of the total project costs in excess of the five percent of gross revenue threshold. In addition, the Ashford Trust Project Management Agreement provides that Premier shall also provide to Ashford Trust Hotels the following services, and shall be paid the following fees: (i) architectural (6.5% of total construction costs); (ii) construction management for projects without a general contractor (10% of total construction costs); (iii) interior design (6% of the purchase price of the property and equipment designed or selected by Premier); and (iv) property and equipment purchasing (8% of the purchase price of the property and equipment purchased by Premier; provided that if the purchase price exceeds $2.0 million for a single hotel in a calendar year, then the purchasing fee is reduced to 6% of the property and equipment purchase price in excess of $2.0 million for such hotel in such calendar year).
The Ashford Trust Project Management Agreement provides for an initial term of 10 years as to each hotel governed by the agreement. The term may be renewed by Premier, at its option, for three successive periods of seven years each and, thereafter, a final term of four years, provided that at the time the option to renew is exercised, Premier is not then in default under the Ashford Trust Project Management Agreement. In certain cases of early termination of the Ashford Trust Project Management Agreement with respect to one or more of the hotels, Ashford Trust must pay Premier termination fees as described in the Ashford Trust Project Management Agreement, plus any amounts otherwise due to Premier.
Ashford Trust Project Management Mutual Exclusivity Agreement 
Pursuant to our Ashford Trust Mutual Exclusivity Agreement, Premier has given Ashford Trust a first right of refusal to purchase any lodging-related investments identified by Premier and any of its affiliates that meet Ashford Trust’s initial investment criteria, and Ashford Trust has agreed to engage Premier to provide development and construction, capital improvement, refurbishment, project management and other services, such as purchasing, interior design, freight management, and construction management, for hotels Ashford Trust acquires or invests in, to the extent that Ashford Trust has the right or controls the right to direct such matters, unless Ashford Trust’s independent directors either: (i) unanimously vote not to hire Premier; or (ii) based on special circumstances or past performance, by a majority vote elect not to engage Premier because they had determined, in their reasonable business judgment, that it would not be in Ashford Trust’s best interest to engage Premier or that another manager or developer could perform the project management or development duties materially better.
The Ashford Trust Mutual Exclusivity Agreement provides for a term ending August 29, 2027, including extensions exercised to date. The term will be automatically extended for one seven year period and, thereafter, a final term of four years, provided that at the time of any such extension an event of default under the Ashford Trust Mutual Exclusivity Agreement does not exist.
Braemar Hotel Master Hotel Management Agreement 
General. Remington has a master hotel management agreement with Braemar (the “Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement”). Pursuant to the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement, Remington currently manages the Pier House Resort & Spa, the Bardessono Hotel & Spa, Hotel Yountville, and Mr. C Beverly Hills Hotel. The Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement will also govern the management of hotels Braemar acquires in the future that are managed by Remington, which has the right to manage and operate hotel properties Braemar acquires in the future unless Braemar’s independent directors either (i) unanimously elect not to engage Remington, or (ii) by a majority vote, elect not to engage Remington because they have determined, in their reasonable business judgment, (A) special circumstances exist such that it would be in Braemar’s best interest not to engage Remington for the particular hotel, or (B) based on the prior performance of Remington, another manager or developer could perform the management duties materially better than Remington for the particular hotel. See “Our Hotel Management Agreements, Project Management Agreements and Mutual Exclusivity 
Agreements with each of Ashford Trust and Braemar—Braemar Hotel Management Mutual Exclusivity Agreement with Remington—Exclusivity Rights of Remington.”
Term. The Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement provides for an initial term of 10 years as to each hotel governed by the agreement. The term may be renewed by Remington, at its option, subject to certain performance tests, for three successive periods of seven years each and, thereafter, a final term of four years, provided that at the time the option to renew is exercised, Remington is not then in default under the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement. If at the time of the exercise of any renewal period, Remington is in default, then the exercise of the renewal option will be conditional on timely cure of such default, and if such default is not timely cured, then Braemar’s TRS lessee may terminate the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement regardless of the exercise of such option and without the payment of any fee or liquidated damages. If Remington desires to exercise any option to renew, it must give Braemar’s TRS lessee written notice of its election to renew the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement no less than 90 days before the expiration of the then-current term of the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement.
Amounts Payable under the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement. Remington receives a base management fee, and if the hotels meet and exceed certain thresholds, an additional incentive fee. The base management fee for each hotel will be due monthly and will be equal to the greater of:
•$16,294 (increased annually based on consumer price index adjustments); or
•3% of the gross revenues associated with that hotel for the related month.
The incentive management fee, if any, for each hotel will be due annually in arrears within 90 days of the end of the fiscal year and will be equal to the lesser of (i) 1% of gross revenues and (ii) the amount by which the actual house profit (gross operating profit of the applicable hotel before deducting management fees or franchise fees) exceeds the target house profit as set forth in the annual operating budget approved for the applicable fiscal year, except with respect to hotels where Remington takes over management upon acquisition by Braemar, in which case, for the first five years, the incentive management fee to be paid to Remington, if any, is the amount by which the hotel’s actual house profit exceeds the projected house profit for such calendar year as set forth in our acquisition pro forma. If, however, based on actual operations and revised forecasts from time to time, it is reasonably anticipated that the incentive fee is reasonably expected to be earned, the TRS lessee will consider payment of the incentive fee pro rata on a quarterly basis.
The incentive fee is designed to encourage Remington to generate higher house profit at each hotel by increasing the fee due to Remington when the hotels generate house profit above certain threshold levels. Any increased revenues will generate increased lease payments under the percentage leases and should thereby benefit our stockholders.
Termination. The Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement may be terminated as to one or more of the hotels earlier than the stated term if certain events occur, including:
•a sale of a hotel;
•the failure of Remington to satisfy certain performance standards;
•for the convenience of Braemar’s TRS lessee;
•in the event of a casualty to, condemnation of, or force majeure involving a hotel; or
•upon a default by Remington or Braemar that is not cured prior to the expiration of any applicable cure periods.
In certain cases of early termination of the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement with respect to one or more of the hotels, Braemar must pay Remington termination fees, plus any amounts otherwise due to Remington pursuant to the terms of the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement. Braemar will be obligated to pay termination fees in the circumstances described below, provided that Remington is not then in default, subject to certain cure and grace periods:
Sale. If any hotel subject to the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement is sold during the first 12 months of the date such hotel becomes subject to the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement, Braemar’s TRS lessee may terminate the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement with respect to such sold hotel, provided that it pays to Remington an amount equal to the management fee (both base fees and incentive fees) estimated to be payable to Remington with respect to the applicable hotel pursuant to the then-current annual operating budget for the balance of the first year of the term. If any hotel subject to the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement is sold at any time after the first year of the term and the TRS lessee terminates the master hotel management agreement with respect to such hotel, Braemar’s TRS lessee will have no obligation to pay any termination fees.
Casualty. If any hotel subject to the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement is the subject of a casualty during the first year of the initial 10-year term and the TRS lessee elects not to rebuild, then Braemar must pay to Remington the termination fee, if any, that would be owed if the hotel had been sold. However, after the first year of the initial 10-year term, if a hotel is the subject of a casualty and the TRS lessee elects not to rebuild the hotel even though sufficient casualty insurance proceeds are available to do so, then the TRS lessee must pay to Remington a termination fee equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) 65% of the aggregate management fees (both base fees and incentive fees) estimated to be paid to Remington with respect to the applicable hotel pursuant to the then-current annual operating budget (but in no event less than the management fees for the preceding full fiscal year) by (ii) nine.
Condemnation or Force Majeure. In the event of a condemnation of, or the occurrence of any force majeure event with respect to, any of the hotels, the TRS lessee has no obligation to pay any termination fees if the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement terminates as to those hotels.
Failure to Satisfy Performance Test. If any hotel subject to the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement fails to satisfy a certain performance test, the TRS lessee may terminate the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement with respect to such hotel, and in such case, the TRS lessee must pay to Remington an amount equal to 60% of the product obtained by multiplying (i) 65% of the aggregate management fees (both base fees and incentive fees) estimated to be paid to Remington with respect to the applicable hotel pursuant to the then-current annual operating budget (but in no event less than the management fees for the preceding full fiscal year) by (ii) nine. Remington will have failed the performance test with respect to a particular hotel if during any fiscal year during the term (i) such hotel’s gross operating profit margin for such fiscal year is less than 75% of the average gross operating profit margins of comparable hotels in similar markets and geographical locations, as reasonably determined by Remington and the TRS lessee, and (ii) such hotel’s RevPAR yield penetration is less than 80%. Upon a performance test failure, the TRS lessee must give Remington two years to cure. If, after the first year, the performance test failure has not been cured, then the TRS lessee may, in order not to waive any such failure, require Remington to engage a consultant with significant hotel lodging experience reasonably acceptable to both Remington and the TRS lessee, to make a determination as to whether or not another management company could manage the hotel in a materially more efficient manner. If the consultant’s determination is in the affirmative, then Remington must engage such consultant to assist with the cure of such performance failure for the second year of the cure period after that failure. If the consultant’s determination is in the negative, then Remington will be deemed not to be in default under the performance test. The cost of such consultant will be shared by the TRS lessee and Remington equally. If Remington fails the performance test for the second year of the cure period and, after that failure, the consultant again makes a finding that another management company could manage the hotel in a materially more efficient manner than Remington, then the TRS lessee has the right to terminate the Braemar hotel management agreement with respect to such hotel upon 45 days’ written notice to Remington and to pay to Remington the termination fee described above. Further, if any hotel subject to the Braemar hotel management agreement is within a cure period due to a failure of the performance test, an exercise of a renewal option shall be conditioned upon timely cure of the performance test failure, and if the performance failure is not timely cured, the TRS lessee may elect to terminate the Braemar hotel management agreement without paying any termination fee.
For Convenience. With respect to any hotel managed by Remington pursuant to the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement, if the TRS lessee elects for convenience to terminate the management of such hotel, at any time, including during any renewal term, the TRS lessee must pay a termination fee to Remington, equal to the product of (i) 65% of the aggregate management fees for such hotel (both base fees and incentive fees) estimated to be payable to Remington with respect to the applicable hotel pursuant to the then-current annual operating budget (but in no event less than the management fees for the preceding full fiscal year) and (ii) nine.
If the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement terminates as to all of the hotels covered in connection with a default under the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement, the Braemar hotel management MEA (as defined below) can also be terminated at the non-defaulting party’s election. See “Our Hotel Management Agreements, Project Management Agreements and Mutual Exclusivity Agreements with each of Ashford Trust and Braemar—Braemar Hotel Management Mutual Exclusivity Agreement with Remington.”
Maintenance and Modifications. Remington must maintain each hotel in good repair and condition and make such routine maintenance, repairs and minor alterations as it deems reasonably necessary. The cost of all such routine maintenance, repairs and alterations will be paid by the TRS lessee. All non-routine repairs and maintenance, either to a hotel or its property and equipment pursuant to the capital improvement budget described below, will be managed by Premier pursuant to the master project management agreement.
Insurance. Remington must coordinate with the TRS lessee the procurement and maintenance of all workers’ compensation, employer’s liability, and other appropriate and customary insurance related to its operations as a hotel manager, the cost of which is the responsibility of the TRS lessee.
Assignment and Subleasing. Neither Remington nor the TRS lessee may assign or transfer the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement without the other party’s prior written consent. However, Remington may assign its rights and obligations to an affiliate that satisfies the eligible independent contractor requirements and is “controlled” by Mr. Monty J. Bennett, his father Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr., or their respective family partnerships or trusts, the sole members or beneficiaries of which are at all times lineal descendants of Messrs. Monty J. Bennett or Archie Bennett, Jr. (including step children) and spouses. “Controlled” means (i) the possession of a majority of the capital stock (or ownership interest) and voting power of such affiliate, directly or indirectly, or (ii) the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such affiliate in the capacity of chief executive officer, president, chairman, or other similar capacity where they are actively engaged or involved in providing such direction or control and spend a substantial amount of time managing such affiliate. No assignment will release Remington from any of its obligations under the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement.
Damage to Hotels. If any of our insured properties is destroyed or damaged, the TRS lessee is obligated, subject to the requirements of the underlying lease, to repair or replace the damaged or destroyed portion of the hotel to the same condition as existed prior to such damage or destruction. If the lease relating to such damaged hotel is terminated pursuant to the terms of the lease, the TRS lessee has the right to terminate the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement with respect to such damaged hotel upon 60 days’ written notice. In the event of a termination, neither the TRS lessee nor Remington will have any further liabilities or obligations under the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement with respect to such damaged hotel, except that Braemar may be obligated to pay to Remington a termination fee, as described above. If the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement remains in effect with respect to such damaged hotel, and the damage does not result in a reduction of gross revenues at the hotel, the TRS lessee’s obligation to pay management fees will be unabated. If, however, the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement remains in effect with respect to such damaged hotel, but the damage does result in a reduction of gross revenues at the hotel, the TRS lessee will be entitled to partial, pro rata abatement of the management fees while the hotel is being repaired.
Condemnation of a Property or Force Majeure. If all or substantially all of a hotel is subject to a total condemnation or a partial taking that prevents use of the property as a hotel, the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement, with respect to such hotel, will terminate, subject to the requirements of the applicable lease. In the event of termination, neither the TRS lessee nor Remington will have any further rights, remedies, liabilities or obligations under the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement with respect to such hotel. If any partial taking of a property does not make it unreasonable to continue to operate the hotel, there is no right to terminate the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement. If there is an event of force majeure or any other cause beyond the control of Remington that directly involves a hotel and has a significant adverse effect upon the continued operations of that hotel, then the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement may be terminated by the TRS lessee. In the event of such a termination, neither the TRS lessee nor Remington will have any further rights, remedies, liabilities or obligations under the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement with respect to such hotel.
Annual Operating Budget. The Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement provides that not less than 45 days prior to the beginning of each fiscal year during the term of the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement, Remington will submit to the TRS lessee for each of the hotels, an annual operating budget setting forth in detail an estimated profit and loss statement for each of the next 12 months (or for the balance of the fiscal year in the event of a partial first fiscal year), including a schedule of hotel room rentals and other rentals and a marketing and business plan for each of the hotels. The budget is subject to the TRS lessee approval, which may not be unreasonably withheld. The budget may be revised from time to time, taking into account such circumstances as the TRS lessee deems appropriate or as business and operating conditions shall demand, subject to the reasonable approval of Remington.
Capital Improvement Budget. Remington must prepare a capital improvement budget of the expenditures necessary for replacement of property and equipment and building repairs for the hotels during the following fiscal year and provide such budget to the relevant TRS lessee and landlord for approval at the same time Remington submits the proposed annual operating budget for approval by TRS lessee. Remington may not make any other expenditures for these items without the relevant TRS lessee and landlord approval, except expenditures which are provided in the capital improvements budget or are required by reason of any (i) emergency, (ii) applicable legal requirements, (iii) the terms of any franchise agreement or (iv) are otherwise required for the continued safe and orderly operation of Braemar’s hotels.
Indemnity Provisions. Remington has agreed to indemnify the TRS lessee against all damages not covered by insurance that arise from: (i) the fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence of Remington subject to certain limitations; (ii) infringement by Remington of any third-party’s intellectual property rights; (iii) employee claims based on a substantial violation by Remington of employment laws or that are a direct result of the corporate policies of Remington; (iv) the knowing or reckless placing, discharge, leakage, use or storage of hazardous materials in violation of applicable environmental laws on or in any of our hotels by Remington; or (v) the breach by Remington of the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement, including action taken by Remington beyond the scope of its authority under the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement, which is not cured.
Except to the extent indemnified by Remington as described in the preceding paragraph, the TRS lessee will indemnify Remington against all damages not covered by insurance and that arise from: (i) the performance of Remington’s services under the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement; (ii) the condition or use of Braemar’s hotels; (iii) certain liabilities to which Remington is subjected, including pursuant to the WARN Act, in connection with the termination of the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement; (iv) all employee cost and expenses; or (v) any claims made by an employee of Remington against Remington that are based on a violation or alleged violation of the employment laws.
Events of Default. Events of default under the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement include:
•The TRS lessee or Remington files a voluntary bankruptcy petition, or experiences a bankruptcy-related event not discharged within 90 days.
•The TRS lessee or Remington fails to make any payment due under the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement, subject to a 10-day notice and cure period.
•The TRS lessee or Remington fails to observe or perform any other term of the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement, subject to a 30-day notice and cure period. There are certain instances in which the 30-day notice and cure period can be extended to up to 120 days.
•Remington does not qualify as an “eligible independent contractor” as such term is defined in Section 856(d)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code.
If an event of default occurs and continues beyond any grace period, the non-defaulting party will have the option of terminating the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement, on 30 days’ notice to the other party.
To minimize conflicts between Braemar and Remington on matters arising under the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement, Braemar’s Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that any waiver, consent, approval, modification, enforcement matters or elections which Braemar may make pursuant to the terms of the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement shall be within the exclusive discretion and control of a majority of the independent members of the board of directors (or higher vote thresholds specifically set forth in such agreements). In addition, Braemar’s board of directors has established a Related Party Transaction Committee comprised solely of independent members of Braemar’s board of directors to review all related party transactions that involve conflicts. The Related Party Transaction Committee may make recommendations to the independent members of Braemar’s board of directors (including rejection of any proposed transaction). All related party transactions are approved by either the Related Party Transaction Committee or the independent members of Braemar’s board of directors.
Braemar Hotel Management Mutual Exclusivity Agreement 
General. Remington has a mutual exclusivity agreement with Braemar (the “Braemar hotel management MEA”) which gives Braemar a first right of refusal to purchase any lodging-related investments identified by Remington and any of its affiliates that meet Braemar’s initial investment criteria, and Braemar agrees to engage Remington to provide hotel management for hotels Braemar acquired or invested in, to the extent that Braemar has the right or control the right to direct such matters.
Term. The initial term of the Braemar hotel management MEA is 10 years from November 19, 2013. This term automatically extends for three additional renewal periods of seven years each and a final renewal period of four years, for a total of up to 35 years. The agreement may be sooner terminated because of:
•an event of default (see “Events of Default”),
•a party’s early termination rights (see “Early Termination”), or
•a termination of all the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreements between TRS lessee and Remington because of an event of default under the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement that affects all properties (see “Relationship with Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement”).
Modification of Investment Guidelines. In the event that Braemar materially modifies its initial investment guidelines without the written consent of Remington, which consent may be withheld at its sole and absolute discretion, and may further be subject to the consent of Ashford Trust, Remington will have no obligation to present or offer Braemar investment opportunities at any time thereafter. Instead, Remington, subject to the superior rights of Ashford Trust or any other party with which Remington may have an existing agreement, shall use their reasonable discretion to determine how to allocate investment opportunities it identifies. In the event Braemar materially modifies its investment guidelines without the written consent of Remington, Ashford Trust will have superior rights to investment opportunities identified by Remington, and Braemar will no longer retain preferential treatment to investment opportunities identified by Remington. A material modification for this 
purpose means any modification of Braemar’s initial investment guidelines to be competitive with Ashford Trust’s investment guidelines.
Our Exclusivity Rights. Remington and Mr. Monty J. Bennett have granted Braemar a first right of refusal to pursue certain lodging investment opportunities identified by Remington or its affiliates (including Mr. Bennett), including opportunities to buy hotel properties, to buy land and build hotels, or to otherwise invest in hotel properties that satisfy Braemar’s initial investment guidelines and are not considered excluded transactions pursuant to the Braemar hotel management MEA. If investment opportunities are identified and are subject to the Braemar hotel management MEA, and Braemar has not materially modified its initial investment guidelines without the written consent of Remington, then Remington, Mr. Bennett and their affiliates, as the case may be, will not pursue those opportunities (except as described below) and will give Braemar a written notice and description of the investment opportunity, and Braemar will have 10 business days to either accept or reject the investment opportunity. If Braemar rejects the opportunity, Remington may then pursue such investment opportunity, subject to a right of first refusal in favor of Ashford Trust pursuant to an existing agreement between Ashford Trust and Remington, on materially the same terms and conditions as offered to Braemar. If the terms of such investment opportunity materially change, then Remington must offer the revised investment opportunity to Braemar, whereupon Braemar will have 10 business days to either accept or reject the opportunity on the revised terms.
Reimbursement of Costs. If Braemar accepts an investment opportunity from Remington, Braemar will be obligated to reimburse Remington or its affiliates for the actual out-of-pocket and third-party costs and expenses paid by Remington or its affiliates in connection with such investment opportunity, including any earnest money deposits, but excluding any finder’s fee, brokerage fee, development fee or other compensation paid by Remington or its affiliates. Remington must submit to Braemar an accounting of the costs in reasonable detail.
Exclusivity Rights of Remington. If Braemar elects to pursue an investment opportunity that consists of the management and operation of a hotel property, Braemar will hire Remington to provide such services unless Braemar’s independent directors either (i) unanimously elect not to engage Remington, or (ii) by a majority vote, elect not to engage Remington because they have determined, in their reasonable business judgment, (A) special circumstances exist such that it would be in Braemar’s best interest not to engage Remington for the particular hotel, or (B) based on the prior performance of Remington, another manager or developer could perform the management duties materially better than Remington for the particular hotel. In return, Remington has agreed that it will provide those services.
Excluded Investment Opportunities. The following are excluded from the Braemar hotel management MEA and are not subject to any exclusivity rights or right of first refusal:
•With respect to Remington, an investment opportunity where Braemar’s independent directors have unanimously voted not to engage Remington as the manager or developer.
•With respect to Remington, an investment opportunity where Braemar’s independent directors, by a majority vote, have elected not to engage Remington as the manager or developer based on their determination, in their reasonable business judgment, that special circumstances exist such that it would be in Braemar’s best interest not to engage Remington with respect to the particular hotel.
•With respect to Remington, an investment opportunity where Braemar’s independent directors, by a majority vote, have elected not to engage Remington as the manager or developer because they have determined, in their reasonable business judgment, that another manager or developer could perform the management, development or other duties materially better than Remington for the particular hotel, based on Remington’s prior performance.
•Existing hotel investments of Remington or its affiliates with any of their existing joint venture partners, investors or property owners.
•Existing bona fide arm’s length third-party management arrangements (or arrangements for other services) of Remington or any of its affiliates with third parties other than Braemar and its affiliates.
•Like-kind exchanges made pursuant to existing contractual obligations by any of the existing joint venture partners, investors or property owners in which Remington or its affiliates have an ownership interest, provided that Remington provides Braemar with notice 10 days prior to such transaction.
Management or Development. If Braemar hires Remington to manage or operate a hotel, it will be pursuant to the terms of the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement agreed to between Braemar and Remington.
Events of Default. Each of the following is a default under the Braemar hotel management MEA:
•Braemar or Remington experience a bankruptcy-related event;
•Braemar fails to reimburse Remington as described under “Reimbursement of Costs,” subject to a 30-day cure period; and
•Braemar or Remington does not observe or perform any other term of the agreement, subject to a 30-day cure period (which may be increased to a maximum of 120 days in certain instances).
If a default occurs, the non-defaulting party will have the option of terminating the Braemar hotel management MEA subject to 30 days’ written notice and pursuing its rights and remedies under applicable law.
Early Termination. Remington has the right to terminate the exclusivity rights granted to Braemar if:
•Mr. Monty J. Bennett is removed as Braemar’s chairman of its board of directors or is not re-appointed to such position, or he resigns as chairman of its board of directors;
•Braemar terminates the Remington exclusivity rights pursuant to the terms of the Braemar hotel management MEA; or
•Braemar’s advisory agreement with Ashford LLC is terminated for any reason pursuant to its terms and Mr. Monty J. Bennett is no longer serving as Braemar’s chairman of its board of directors.
Braemar may terminate the exclusivity rights granted to Remington if:
•Remington fails to qualify as an “eligible independent contractor” as defined in Section 856(d)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and for that reason, Braemar terminates the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement with Remington;
•Braemar experiences a change in control and terminates the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement between Braemar and Remington with respect to all hotels and have paid a termination fee equal to the product of (i) 65% of the aggregate management fees budgeted in the annual operating budget applied to the hotels for the full current fiscal year in which such termination is to occur for such hotels (both base fees and incentive fees, but in no event less than the base fees and incentive fees for the preceding full fiscal year) and (ii) nine;
•the Remington parties terminate Braemar’s exclusivity rights pursuant to the terms of the Braemar hotel management MEA; or
•Braemar’s advisory agreement with Ashford LLC is terminated for any reason pursuant to its terms and Mr. Monty J. Bennett is no longer serving as Braemar’s chairman of its board of directors.
Assignment. The Braemar hotel management MEA may not be assigned by any of the parties without the prior written consent of the other parties, provided that Remington can assign its interest in the Braemar hotel management MEA, without the written consent of the other parties, to a “manager affiliate entity” as that term is defined in the agreement, so long as such affiliate qualifies as an “eligible independent contractor” at the time of such transfer.
Relationship with Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement. The rights provided to Braemar and to Remington in the Braemar hotel management MEA may be terminated if the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement between Braemar and Remington terminates in its entirety because of an event of default as to all of the then-managed properties. A termination of Remington’s management rights with respect to one or more hotels (but not all hotels) does not terminate the Braemar hotel management MEA. A termination of the Braemar hotel management MEA does not terminate the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement either in part or in whole, and the Braemar Master Hotel Management Agreement would continue in accordance with its terms as to the hotels covered, despite a termination of the Braemar hotel management MEA.
Braemar Project Management Agreement
Pursuant to the Braemar Project Management Agreement, Braemar TRS Corporation, a subsidiary of Braemar OP (“Braemar TRS”) has appointed Premier as its sole, exclusive and continuing manager to manage, coordinate, plan and execute the capital improvement budget and all major repositionings of hotels owned or leased by Braemar TRS (collectively, “Braemar Hotels”) and to provide Project Services.
The Braemar Project Management Agreement provides that Premier shall be paid a design and construction fee equal to four percent of the total project costs associated with the implementation of the capital improvement budget (both hard and soft) payable monthly in arrears based upon the prior calendar month’s total expenditures under the capital improvement budget until such time that the capital improvement budget and/or renovation project involves the expenditure of an amount in excess of five percent of the gross revenues of the applicable Braemar Hotel, whereupon the design and construction fee shall be reduced to three percent of the total project costs in excess of the five percent of gross revenue threshold. In addition, the Braemar Project Management Agreement provides that Premier shall also provide to Braemar Hotels the following services and shall be paid the following fees: (i) architectural (6.5% of total construction costs); (ii) construction management for projects without a general contractor (10% of total construction costs); (iii) interior design (6% of the purchase price of the property and equipment 
designed or selected by Premier); and (iv) property and equipment purchasing (8% of the purchase price of property and equipment purchased by Premier; provided that if the purchase price exceeds $2.0 million for a single hotel in a calendar year, then the purchasing fee is reduced to 6% of the property and equipment purchase price in excess of $2.0 million for such hotel in such calendar year).
The Braemar Project Management Agreement provides for an initial term of 10 years as to each hotel governed by the agreement. The term may be renewed by Premier, at its option, for three successive periods of seven years each and, thereafter, a final term of four years, provided that at the time the option to renew is exercised, Premier is not then in default under the Braemar Project Management Agreement. In certain cases of early termination of the Braemar Project Management Agreement with respect to one or more of the hotels, Braemar must pay Premier termination fees as described in the Braemar Project Management Agreement, plus any amounts otherwise due to Premier.
 Braemar Project Management Mutual Exclusivity Agreement 
Pursuant to the Braemar Mutual Exclusivity Agreement, Premier has given Braemar a first right of refusal to purchase any lodging-related investments identified by Premier and any of its affiliates that meet Braemar’s initial investment criteria, and Braemar has agreed to engage Premier to provide development and construction, capital improvement, refurbishment, project management and other services, such as purchasing, interior design, freight management, and construction management, for hotels Braemar acquires or invests in, to the extent that Braemar has the right or controls the right to direct such matters, unless Braemar’s independent directors either: (i) unanimously vote not to hire Premier; or (ii) based on special circumstances or past performance, by a majority vote elect not to engage Premier because they had determined, in their reasonable business judgment, that it would not be in Braemar’s best interest to engage Premier or that another manager or developer could perform the project management or development duties materially better.
The Braemar Mutual Exclusivity Agreement provides for an initial term until November 19, 2023. The initial term will be automatically extended for three successive periods of seven years each and, thereafter, a final term of four years, provided that at the time of any such extension an event of default under the Braemar Mutual Exclusivity Agreement does not exist.
The foregoing descriptions of the Amended and Restated Mutual Exclusivity Agreement with Remington Lodging, Mutual Exclusivity Agreements with Braemar and Ashford Trust, and Master Project Management Agreements with Braemar and Ashford Trust are qualified in their entirety by reference to the agreements, which have been included as exhibits to other documents filed with the SEC and are incorporated by reference to this Form 10-K.
Our Investor Rights Agreement, Merger and Registration Rights Agreement, Non-Competition Agreement, Transition Cost Sharing Agreement and Hotel Services Agreement with the Bennetts
Investor Rights Agreement
In connection with the acquisition of the hotel management business conducted by Remington Lodging which closed on November 6, 2019, the Company, Mr. Monty J. Bennett, Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr., MJB Investments, LP, Mr. James L. Cowen, Mr. Jeremy Walter, Mr. Mark A. Sharkey, Ms. Marissa A. Bennett and other related parties entered into an investor rights agreement (the “Investor Rights Agreement”) governing the relationship of such parties subsequent to such closing. The Investor Rights Agreement supersedes and replaces the previously existing investor rights agreement, dated August 8, 2018, in all respects.
Board Designation Rights. For so long as the holders of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (together with each person that succeeds to their respective interests as the result of a transfer permitted under the Investor Rights Agreement, the “Covered Investors”) beneficially own no less than 20% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock (taking into account the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis), Mr. Monty J. Bennett, during his lifetime, and the Covered Investors holding 55% of the common stock (taking into account the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis held by all Covered Investors) thereafter, will be entitled to nominate one individual (other than Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr.), and Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr., during his lifetime, and the Covered Investors holding 55% of the common stock (taking into account the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis held by all Covered Investors) thereafter, will be entitled to nominate one individual (other than Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr.) for election as a member of our board of directors (each, a “Seller Nominee”). Initially, Mr. Monty J. Bennett will serve as the Seller Nominee of Mr. Monty J. Bennett, and Mr. W. Michael Murphy will serve as the Seller Nominee of Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr.
In the event we fail to pay the accrued preferred dividends on the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock for two consecutive quarterly periods, the Covered Investors agree that one of the two additional board designation rights arising under the Certificate of Designation (as defined below) shall be vested in Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr., during his lifetime, and the other such board designation right shall be vested in Mr. Monty J. Bennett, during his lifetime. In furtherance of the foregoing, each 
Covered Investor agrees that it will vote all of such Covered Investor’s Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, and consent to any action by the holders of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock without a meeting as permitted under appropriate state law, as may be directed Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr., or Mr. Monty J. Bennett, respectively, in connection with their designation of the individuals to fill such board seats.
Transfer Restrictions. For five years after the closing of the acquisition of Remington Lodging, each of the Covered Investors are prohibited from transferring our common stock or Series D Convertible Preferred Stock to any person that is or would become, together with such person’s affiliates and associates, a beneficial owner of 10% or more of the then outstanding shares of our common stock, taking into account the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock on an as converted basis, except (i) to family members and in connection with estate planning, (ii) as a result of any voting agreement between Mr. Monty J. Bennett and Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr., (iii) transfers in which no transferee (or group of affiliated or associated transferees) would purchase or receive 2% or more of the outstanding voting shares of the Company, (iv) in connection with any widespread public distribution of shares of our common stock or Series D Convertible Preferred Stock registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or (v) a transfer to any transferee that would beneficially own more than 50% of our outstanding common stock and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock without any transfer from a Covered Investor, unless such transfer restrictions have been waived by the affirmative vote of the majority of our stockholders that are not affiliates or associates of the Covered Investors.
Voting Limitations. The Investor Rights Agreement provides that the Covered Investors agree that on matters submitted to a vote of the holders of voting securities of the Company, the Covered Investors will have the right to vote or direct or cause the vote of the shares as to which they hold sole voting power or are held by immediate family members (or a trust for the benefit of such person) (collectively, the “Sole Voting Shares”) as the Covered Investors determine, in their sole discretion, except if, prior to August 8, 2023 only with respect to the voting securities of the Company, the combined voting power of the Reference Shares (as defined below) of the Company exceeds 40.0% (plus the combined voting power of (A) any common stock of the Company purchased by any Covered Investor in an arm’s length transaction after the closing of the Transactions from a person other than the Company or a subsidiary of the Company, for cash, including through open market purchases, and (B) privately negotiated transactions or any distributions of our common stock by either of Ashford Trust or Braemar to its respective stockholders pro rata) of the combined voting power of all of our outstanding voting securities entitled to vote on any given matter, then Reference Shares of the Company representing voting power equal to such excess will be deemed to be “Company Cleansed Shares” under the Investor Rights Agreement. The Covered Investors agree that they will vote, or cause to be voted, out of the Covered Investors’ Sole Voting Shares, shares constituting voting power equal to the voting power of the Company Cleansed Shares in the same proportion as the holders of such class or series of voting securities of the Company vote their shares with respect to such matters, exclusive of the Reference Shares of the Company voted by the Covered Investors. These restrictions may be waived by a majority vote or consent of our independent directors that have no personal interest in the matter to be voted upon. “Reference Shares” means all voting securities of the Company that are (without duplication): (i) beneficially owned by any Covered Investor, including any such voting securities as to which any Covered Investor has sole or shared voting power; (ii) beneficially owned by any member of a Group of which any Covered Investor is a member; or (iii) subject to or referenced in any derivative or synthetic interest that (A) conveys any voting right in our common stock or (B) is required to be, or is capable of being, settled through delivery of our common stock in either case, that is held or beneficially owned by any Covered Investor or any controlled affiliate or any Covered Investor. The Covered Investors also agree among themselves that the total number of votes attributable to Reference Shares that are not Cleansed Shares will be proportionately allocated among the Covered Investors based on a percentage, the numerator of which is the number of Reference Shares held by such Covered Investor, and the denominator of which is the total number of Reference Shares held by all Covered Investors in the aggregate.
The Holder Group Investors (as defined below) will not, subject to certain exceptions and until the aggregate voting power of the Holder Group Investors is less than 25% of the combined voting power of all of the outstanding voting securities of the Company on any given matter, until the fifth anniversary of the closing of the Transactions: (i) take any action, vote such Holder Group Investor’s securities, or into any transaction, including by acting in consent with another person, that would result in the Company being treated as a “controlled company” under the applicable rules of the NYSE American nor (ii) take any action, vote such Holder Group Investor’s securities, or into any transaction, including by acting in concert with another person, that results in the Company engaging in a Rule 13e-3 Transaction (as defined in the rules and regulations issued by the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), provided, that the restriction set forth in this clause (ii) may be waived by the affirmative vote of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of our voting stock (taking into account the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis) that are not beneficially owned by the Holder Group Investors (provided that, for purposes of clause (ii), our voting stock that is owned of record by Ashford Trust or Braemar shall not be deemed to be beneficially owned by the Holder Group Investors so long as the decision to vote such shares on such waiver is solely determined by a majority of the members of the board of directors of the applicable entity who are independent within the meaning of applicable rules of the NYSE American (or any exchange on which our voting stock is 
then listed) and do not have a material financial interest in such Rule 13e-3 Transaction (or a duly appointed board committee consisting only of such independent and disinterested board members)).
Put Option. Each Covered Investor has the option, exercisable with respect to each and every Change of Control (defined below) that may occur following the date of the Investor Rights Agreement, to sell to the Company all or any portion of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock then owned by such Covered Investor (the “Change of Control Put Option”) at any time during the ten business day consecutive period following the consummation of a Change of Control. “Change of Control” means, with respect to any Covered Investor, any of the following, in each case that was not voted for or consented to by such Covered Investor solely in its capacity as a stockholder of the Company (but not in any other capacity): (i) any person (other than Mr. Monty J. Bennett, Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr., MJB Investments, LP their controlled affiliates, any trust or other estate in which any of them has a substantial beneficial interest or as to which any of them serves as trustee or in a similar fiduciary capacity, any immediate family member of Mr. Monty J. Bennett or Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr., or any group (as defined in Rule 13d-5(b) under the Exchange Act)) acquires beneficial ownership of securities of the Company that, together with the securities of the Company previously beneficially owned by the first such person, constitutes more than 50% of the total voting power of our outstanding securities, or (ii) the sale, lease, transfer or other disposition (other than as collateral) of all or a majority of our (taken as a whole) assets or income or revenue generating capacity, other than to any direct or indirect majority-owned and controlled affiliate of the Company.

Preemptive Rights. The Investor Rights Agreement also provides that, except for issuances contemplated by the transaction documents entered into under the Combination Agreement, we will not issue any equity securities, rights to acquire equity securities of the Company or debt convertible into equity securities of the Company (collectively, the “New Securities”), unless we give the Bennetts and each person that succeeds to the interests of the Bennetts and certain permitted transferees (“Holder Group Investors”) notice of its respective intention to issue New Securities and the right of such Holder Group Investor to acquire such Holder Group Investor’s pro rata share of the New Securities.

A Covered Investor will automatically cease to be bound by the Investor Rights Agreement solely in its capacity as a Covered Investor at such time as such Covered Investor no longer owns any of our common stock or any Series D Convertible Preferred Stock.
Merger and Registration Rights Agreement
In connection with the acquisition of the hotel management business conducted by Remington Lodging which closed on November 6, 2019, the Company, Ashford Merger Sub Inc., the Bennetts and the Covered Investors entered into the Merger and Registration Rights Agreement (the “Merger Agreement”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company filed a registration statement on March 5, 2020 under the Securities Act to permit the resale of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock and our common stock into which the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible. The registration statement was declared effective on March 12, 2020.

In certain circumstances, including at any time that we are in possession of material nonpublic information, we will have the right to suspend sales under the registration statement.
Non-Competition Agreement
In connection with the acquisition of the hotel management business conducted by Remington Lodging which closed on November 6, 2019, the Company and the Bennetts entered into a non-competition agreement (the “Non-Competition Agreement”). Subject to certain exclusions, the Non-Competition Agreement provides that for a period of the later of five years following the closing of the Transactions, or three years following the date on which Mr. Monty J. Bennett is no longer our principal executive officer, each of Mr. Monty J. Bennett and Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr. will not, and will cause its controlled affiliates not to, directly or indirectly (i) engage in, or have an interest in a person that engages directly or indirectly in, (a) the hotel management business conducted by Remington and its subsidiaries within the lodging industry, including hotel operations, sales and marketing, revenue management, budget oversight, guest service, asset maintenance (not involving capital expenditures) and related services conducted by Remington and its subsidiaries or (b) the design and construction business conducted by Premier, within the lodging industry, including construction management, interior design, architecture, and the purchasing, expediting, warehousing, freight management, installation and supervision of property and equipment, and related services, in each case in clause (a) or (b) anywhere in the United States (excluding certain passive investments and existing relationships); or (ii) intentionally interfere in any material respect with the business relationships between Remington, Premier and their respective customers, clients or vendors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Bennetts may, among other things, (A) freely pursue any opportunity to acquire ownership, directly or indirectly, in any interests in real properties in the lodging industry if such opportunity has been presented to the board of each of the Company, Ashford Trust and Braemar and none of the foregoing elect to pursue or participate in such opportunity and (B) with respect to any hotel properties in which the Bennetts, or any of their controlled affiliates, own, directly or indirectly (other than through their ownership interests in Ashford Trust or Braemar), in the aggregate at least a 5% interest (such hotel properties, “Bennett-Owned Properties”), each Bennett, and any of his controlled affiliates, directly or indirectly: (x) may self-manage the provision of hotel management business services or design and construction business services to such Bennett-Owned Properties, but may not provide any such services to any other hotels not constituting Bennett-Owned Properties, or (y) may require that the Company provide hotel management business services and design and construction business services pursuant to the terms of the Hotel Services Agreement (as defined below).
Transition Cost Sharing Agreement
In connection with the acquisition of the hotel management business conducted by Remington Lodging which closed on November 6, 2019, the Bennetts entered into a transition cost sharing agreement (the “Transition Cost Sharing Agreement”) with us, pursuant to which the Company and Remington will provide the Bennetts with family office related services, including accounting, tax, legal and general office and administrative support services (collectively, the “Services”) generally in accordance with Remington’s past practice prior to the closing. The Bennetts will pay to the Company and Remington the actual costs incurred by the Company and Remington, including salaries, employment taxes and benefits applicable to the employees of the Company and Remington providing the Services, based on the percentage of time spent by such employees in providing the Services, relative to the time spent by such employees on matters not related to the Services, plus applicable allocated overhead and other expenses incurred, in each case without mark-up. Subject to certain exceptions, the Services are required to be provided by the Company and Remington until the last to occur of: (i) the tenth anniversary of the date of the Transition Cost Sharing Agreement; (ii) the death of Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr. and (iii) 30 days following the date on which Mr. Monty J. Bennett is no longer employed by us as our chief executive officer, or substantially similar executive position, or ceases to serve as a member of our board of directors.

In connection with the acquisition of the hotel management business conducted by Remington Lodging which closed on November 6, 2019, the Bennetts entered into a hotel services agreement (the “Hotel Services Agreement”) with us, pursuant to which we will provide specified hotel design and construction and hotel management services to any hotel in which the Bennetts, in the aggregate, directly or indirectly (other than through their ownership of interests in Ashford Trust and Braemar) own at least a 5% interest, in exchange for fees in an amount equal to the cost of such services provided plus 5%, until the last to occur of: (i) the tenth anniversary of the commencement of services or (ii) the death of Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr. and Mr. Monty J. Bennett.
Agreements with Lismore
Lismore Agreement with Ashford Trust
On March 20, 2020, Lismore, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into an agreement with Ashford Trust (the “Ashford Trust Agreement”). Pursuant to the Ashford Trust Agreement, Lismore shall, during the term of the agreement (which commenced on March 20, 2020 and shall end on the date that is twelve months following the commencement date, or upon it being terminated by Ashford Trust on not less than thirty days written notice) negotiate the refinancing, modification or forbearance of the existing mortgage debt on Ashford Trust’s hotels. For the purposes of the Ashford Trust Agreement, financing shall include, without limitation, senior or subordinate loan financing, provided in any single transaction or a combination of transactions, including, mortgage loan financing, mezzanine loan financing, or subordinate loan financing encumbering the applicable hotel or unsecured loan financing.
On July 1, 2020, Lismore and Ashford Trust amended and restated the Ashford Trust Agreement with an effective date of April 6, 2020. Pursuant to the amended and restated agreement, the term of the agreement was extended to 24 months following the commencement date. In connection with the services to be provided by Lismore under the amended and restated agreement, Lismore received a fee of $2.6 million in three equal installments of $857,000 per month beginning July 20, 2020, and ending on September 20, 2020. Lismore is also entitled to receive a fee that is calculated and payable as follows: (i) a fee equal to 25 basis points (0.25%) of the amount of a loan, payable upon the acceptance by the applicable lender of any forbearance or extension of such loan, or in the case where a third-party agent or contractor engaged by Ashford Trust has secured an extension of the maturity date equal to or greater than 12 months of any such loan, then the amount payable to Lismore shall be reduced to 10 basis points (0.10%); (ii) a fee equal to 75 basis points (0.75%) of the amount of any principal reduction of a loan upon the acceptance by any lender of any principal reduction of such loan; and (iii) a fee equal to 150 basis points (1.50%) of the implied conversion value (but in any case, no less than 50% of the face value of such loan or loans) of a loan upon the acceptance by any lender of any debt to equity conversion of such loan.
The Ashford Trust Agreement additionally allows for the Company to receive certain fees for refinancings performed within eight months after the Ashford Trust Agreement terminates. The Ashford Trust Agreement terminated effective April 6, 2022. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized revenue of $2.4 million, $10.3 million and $5.7 million, respectively. Revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes a $1.2 million cumulative catch-up adjustment to revenue which was previously considered constrained. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company recorded $0 and $2.4 million, respectively, as deferred income. The deferred income related to the various Lismore fees described above was recognized over the 24 month term of the agreement on a straight line basis as the service was rendered, only to the extent it was probable that a significant reversal of revenue would not occur. Constraints relating to variable consideration were resolved generally upon the closing of a transaction or financing event and the resulting change in the transaction price was adjusted on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period a transaction or financing event closed. 
Lismore Agreement with Braemar
On March 20, 2020, Lismore entered into an agreement to seek modifications, forbearances or refinancing of Braemar’s loans (the “Braemar Agreement”). Pursuant to the Braemar Agreement, Lismore shall, during the term of the agreement (which commenced on March 2020 and terminated on March 20, 2021) negotiate the refinancing, modification or forbearance of the existing mortgage and mezzanine debt on Braemar’s hotels. For the purposes of the Braemar Agreement, financing shall include, without limitation, senior or subordinate loan financing, provided in any single transaction or a combination of transactions, including, mortgage loan financing, mezzanine loan financing, or subordinate loan financing encumbering the applicable hotel or unsecured loan financing. 
In connection with the services provided by Lismore, Lismore shall be paid an advisory fee of up to 50 basis points (0.50%) of the aggregate amount of the modifications, forbearances or refinancing, of Braemar’s mortgage and mezzanine debt and Braemar’s secured revolving credit facility (the “Braemar Financings”) calculated and payable as follows: (i) 0.125% of the aggregate amount of potential Braemar Financings upon execution of the Braemar Agreement; (ii) 0.125% payable in six equal 
installments beginning April 20, 2020 and ending on September 20, 2020; provided, however, in the event Braemar does not complete, for any reason, Braemar Financings during the term of the Braemar Agreement equal to or greater than $1.1 billion, then Braemar shall offset, against any fees owed by Braemar or its affiliates pursuant to the advisory agreement, a portion of the fee paid by Braemar to Lismore pursuant to this section equal to the product of (x) the amount of Braemar Financings completed during the term of the Braemar Agreement minus $1.1 billion multiplied by (y) 0.125%; and (iii) 25 basis points (0.25%) payable upon the acceptance by the applicable lender of any Braemar Financing.
Upon entering into the Braemar Agreement, Braemar made an initial payment of approximately $1.4 million. Braemar also paid the Company a total of $1.4 million in six equal installments beginning April 20, 2020 and ending September 20, 2020, of which $681,000 was subject to claw back and was set-off against the cash payment of Braemar’s base advisory fees upon the termination of the Braemar Agreement in March 2021. Braemar additionally paid the Company approximately $1.4 million in success fees in connection with signed forbearance or other agreements, of which no amounts were available for claw back. In total, Braemar paid approximately $4.1 million under the Braemar Agreement.
For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized revenue of $0, $853,000, and $2.6 million, respectively, related to the Braemar Agreement. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have any deferred income related to the Braemar Agreement. The Braemar Agreement terminated effective March 20, 2021.
Regulation 
General. The Company, Ashford Trust, and Braemar, as applicable, are subject, in certain circumstances, to supervision and regulation by state and federal governmental authorities and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions, which, among other things regulate public disclosures, reporting obligations and capital raising activity. As an advisor to companies that own hotel properties, the operations and properties of such entities are subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas and fire and safety requirements.
REIT Regulations. Each of Ashford Trust and Braemar has elected and is qualified and expects to continue to qualify to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. As REITs, such companies must currently distribute, at a minimum, an amount equal to 90% of their taxable income. In addition, such companies must distribute 100% of taxable income to avoid paying corporate federal income taxes. REITs are also subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements in order to elect and maintain REIT status. These requirements include specific share ownership tests and assets and gross income composition tests. If either Ashford Trust or Braemar fails to continue to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it is subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on its taxable income at regular corporate tax rates. Even if such companies continue to qualify for taxation as REITs, they may be subject to state and local income taxes and to federal income tax and excise tax on their undistributed income.
Americans with Disabilities Act. As the advisor to Ashford Trust and Braemar, we are responsible for ensuring that the hotels owned by such entities comply with applicable provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (the “ADA”) to the extent that such hotels are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. Non-compliance with the ADA could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we continue to assess the hotels and to advise Ashford Trust or Braemar, as applicable, to make alterations as appropriate in this respect.
Affordable Care Act. Changes in laws and regulations could reduce our profits or increase our costs. We are subject to a variety of laws, regulations and policies including the employer mandate provisions of the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), which imposes penalties on employers failing to offer affordable, minimum value health care coverage to substantially all full-time equivalent employees and their dependents. We do not anticipate incurring any significant penalties under the ACA. Any such penalty would be based on the number of full-time employees. As of December 31, 2022, we had 127 full-time domestic corporate employees and approximately 7,700 employees at our consolidated subsidiaries that provide products and services primarily to the lodging industry.
Environmental Matters. Under various laws relating to the protection of the environment, a current or previous owner or operator (including tenants) of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances at that property and may be required to investigate and clean up such contamination at that property or emanating from that property. These costs could be substantial and liability under these laws may attach without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the contaminants, and the liability may be joint and several. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at the hotels owned by Ashford Trust or Braemar may expose such entities, and potentially us, to third-party liability or materially and adversely affect the ability to sell, lease or develop the real estate or to incur debt using the real estate as collateral.
The hotels owned by Ashford Trust and Braemar are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that address a wide variety of issues, including, but not limited to, storage tanks, air emissions from emergency generators, storm water and wastewater discharges, lead-based paint, mold and mildew and waste management. These hotels incur costs to comply with these laws and regulations, and we or the property owners could be subject to fines and penalties for non-compliance.
Some of these hotels may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other adverse conditions, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediation. The presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of the hotels owned by Ashford Trust or Braemar could require a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected hotel or increase indoor ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from guests or employees at the hotels and others if property damage or health concerns arise.
In the judgment of management, while we may incur significant expense complying with the various regulation to which we are subject, existing statutes and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business. However, it is not possible to forecast the nature of future legislation, regulations, judicial decisions, orders or interpretations, nor their impact upon our future business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
Distributions and Our Distribution Policy
Evaluation of our distribution policy and the decision to make a distribution is made solely at the discretion of our board of directors and is based on factors including, but not limited to, our ability to generate income, availability of existing cash balances, the performance of our business, capital requirements, applicable law, access to cash in the capital markets and other financing sources, general economic conditions and economic conditions that more specifically impact our business or prospects and other factors our board of directors deems relevant.
Future distribution levels are subject to adjustment based upon any one or more of the factors set forth above, the matters discussed under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other document we file with the SEC under the Exchange Act and other factors that our board of directors may, from time to time, deem relevant to consider when determining an appropriate distribution. Our board of directors may also determine not to make any distribution.
Competition
The asset management industry is highly competitive. We compete on an industry, regional and niche basis based on a number of factors, including ability to raise capital, investment opportunities and performance, transaction execution skills, access to and retention of qualified personnel, reputation, range of products, innovation and fees for our services. Our clients compete with many third parties engaged in the hotel industry, including other hotel operating companies, ownership companies (including hotel REITs) and national and international hotel brands. Some of these competitors, including other REITs and private real estate companies and funds may have substantially greater financial and operational resources than Ashford Trust or Braemar and may have greater knowledge of the markets in which we seek to invest. Such competitors may also enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies. Future competition from new market entrants may limit the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to Ashford Trust and Braemar. It may also result in higher prices, lower yields and a more narrow margin over the borrowing cost for Ashford Trust and Braemar, making it more difficult to originate or acquire new investments on attractive terms. Certain competitors may also be subject to different regulatory regimes or rules that may provide them more flexibility or better access to pursue potential investments and raise capital for their managed companies. In addition, certain competitors may have higher risk tolerance, different risk assessment or a lower return threshold, which could allow them to consider a broader range of investments and to bid more aggressively for investment opportunities that we may want to pursue.
Ashford Trust and Braemar each compete with many third parties engaged in the hotel industry. Competition in the hotel industry is based on a number of factors, most notably convenience of location, brand affiliation, price, range of services, guest amenities or accommodations offered and quality of customer service. Competition is often specific to the individual markets in which properties are located and includes competition from existing and new hotels. We believe that hotels that are affiliated with leading national brands, such as the Marriott or Hilton brands, will enjoy the competitive advantages associated with operating under such brands. Increased competition could have a material adverse effect on the occupancy rate, average daily room rate and RevPAR of the hotels owned by Ashford Trust or Braemar or may require capital improvements that otherwise would not have to be made, which may result in decreases in the profitability of Ashford Trust or Braemar and decreased advisory fees to us. Since the fees we receive are based in part upon total equity market capitalization and total shareholder returns, such fees are impacted by relative performance of the share price of Ashford Trust and Braemar compared to competitive REITs.
Insurance
We are required under our advisory agreements to maintain errors and omissions insurance coverage and other insurance coverage in amounts which are carried by managers performing functions similar to those we provide.
Shareholder Rights Plan
On August 30, 2022, we adopted a shareholder rights plan by entering into a Rights Agreement, dated August 30, 2022, with ComputerShare Trust Company, N.A., as rights agent (the “Rights Agreement”). The Rights Agreement was adopted in response to recent volatility of the stock market and trading of our common stock and is intended to protect the Company and its stockholders from efforts to obtain control or rapid share accumulations that are inconsistent with the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Our board of directors implemented the rights plan by declaring (i) a dividend to the holders of the Company’s common stock of one preferred share purchase right (a “Right”) for each share of common stock and (ii) a dividend to the holders of the Company’s Series D Convertible Preferred Stock of one Right in respect of each share of the Company’s common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. The dividends were distributed on September 9, 2022, to our stockholders of record on that date. Each of those Rights become exercisable on the date on which the Rights separate and begin trading separately from our common stock and entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of our Series F Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Series F Preferred Stock”), at a price of $275 per one one-thousandth of a share of our Series F Preferred Stock represented by such Right, subject to adjustment. The Rights will expire on July 30, 2023, unless the expiration date is extended or unless the Rights are earlier redeemed by the Company. The value of the Rights was de minimis.
Initially, the Rights will be attached to all common stock and Series D Preferred Share certificates and no separate certificates evidencing the Rights (“Right Certificates”) will be issued. The Rights Agreement provides that, until the Distribution Date (as defined below), or earlier expiration or redemption of the Rights: (i) the Rights will be transferred with and only with the common stock and the Series D Preferred Shares, (ii) new common stock and the Series D Preferred Shares certificates issued after September 9, 2022 (the “Record Date”) or upon transfer or new issuance of common stock and Series D Preferred Shares will contain a notation incorporating the Rights Agreement by reference, and (iii) the surrender for transfer of any certificates for common stock or Series D Preferred Shares outstanding as of the Record Date, even without such notation or a copy of the Summary of Rights being attached thereto, will also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the common stock or the Series D Preferred Shares represented by such certificate. The Rights would separate and begin trading separately from the common stock and the Series D Preferred Shares, and Right Certificates will be caused to evidence the rights on the earlier to occur of:
i.10 business days following a public announcement, or the public disclosure of facts indicating, that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons has acquired Beneficial Ownership (as defined below) of 10% or more of the outstanding common stock (with certain exceptions as described below, an “Acquiring Person”) (or, in the event an exchange is effected in accordance with Section 24 of the Rights Agreement and our board of directors determines that a later date is advisable, then such later date that is not more than 20 days after such public announcement); or
ii.10 business days (or such later date as may be determined by action of our board of directors prior to such time as any person becomes an Acquiring Person) following the commencement of, or announcement of an intention to make, a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a person or group of 10% or more of the outstanding common stock (the earlier of such dates, the “Distribution Date”). 
An Acquiring Person shall not include (i) the Company, (ii) any subsidiary of the Company, (iii) any employee benefit plan of the Company or of any subsidiary of the Company, (iv) any entity or trustee holding (or acting in a fiduciary capacity in respect of) common stock for or pursuant to the terms of any such employee benefit plan or for the purpose of funding any such plan or funding other employee benefits for employees of the Company or of any subsidiary of the Company, (v) Monty J. Bennett and his affiliates and associates and (vi) any person who or which, at the close of business on the Record Date, was a Beneficial Owner of 10% or more of the common stock of the Company then outstanding, other than a person who or which is not an affiliate or associate of the Beneficial Owner (as defined in the Rights Agreement) on the Record Date and who or which subsequently becomes an affiliate or associate of such Beneficial Owner without the prior written approval of the Board (a “Grandfathered Stockholder”); provided, however, that if a Grandfathered Stockholder becomes, after the Record Date, the Beneficial Owner of additional common stock (other than as a result of certain corporate actions of the Company), regardless of whether, thereafter or as a result thereof, there is an increase, decrease or no change in the percentage of common stock then outstanding beneficially owned by such Grandfathered Stockholder, then such Grandfathered Stockholder shall be deemed an Acquiring Person unless, upon such acquisition of beneficial ownership of additional common stock, such Grandfathered Stockholder is not the Beneficial Owner of 10% or more of the common stock then outstanding; provided further that upon the first decrease of a Grandfathered Stockholder’s beneficial ownership below 10%, such Grandfathered Stockholder shall no 
longer be considered a Grandfathered Stockholder and this clause (vi) shall have no further force or effect with respect to such Grandfathered Stockholder.
If a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person at any time after the date of the Rights Agreement (with certain limited exceptions) the Rights will become exercisable for common stock (or, in certain circumstances, Preferred Shares or other similar securities of the Company) having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the Right. From and after the announcement that any person has become an Acquiring Person, if the Rights evidenced by a Right Certificate are or were at any time on or after the earlier of (i) the date of such announcement or (ii) the Distribution Date acquired or beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person or an associate or affiliate of an Acquiring Person, such Rights shall become void, and any holder of such Rights shall thereafter have no right to exercise such Rights.
If, at any time after a person becomes an Acquiring Person: (i) the Company consolidates with, or merges with and into, any other person; (ii) any person consolidates with the Company, or merges with and into the Company, and the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation of such merger and, in connection with such merger, all or part of the common stock are or will be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other person (or the Company) or cash or any other property; or (iii) 50% or more of its consolidated assets or Earning Power (as defined in the Rights Agreement) are sold, then proper provision will be made so that each holder of a Right will thereafter have the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at the then current exercise price of the Right, that number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company which at the time of such transaction will have a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right. Upon the occurrence of a flip-in or flip-over event, if the Board so elects, the Company shall deliver upon payment of the exercise price of a Right an amount of cash or securities equivalent in value to the common stock issuable upon exercise of a Right; provided that, if the Company fails to meet such obligation within 30 days following of the announcement that a person has become an Acquiring Person, the Company must deliver, upon exercise of a Right but without requiring payment of the exercise price then in effect, common stock (to the extent available) and cash equal in value to the difference between the value of the common stock otherwise issuable upon the exercise of a Right and the exercise price then in effect. The Board may extend the 30-day period described above for up to an additional 60 days to permit the taking of action that may be necessary to authorize sufficient additional common stock to permit the issuance of common stock upon the exercise in full of the Rights.
