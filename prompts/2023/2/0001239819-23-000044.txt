 ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Company Overview and Business Model
Luna Innovations Incorporated ("we" or the "Company") is a leader in advanced optical technology, providing high performance fiber optic test, measurement and control products for the telecommunications and photonics industries; and distributed fiber optic sensing solutions that measure and monitor materials and structures for applications in aerospace, automotive, oil and gas, security and infrastructure. We have a broad range of products for these applications based on proprietary technology covered by a portfolio of over 700 patents either owned or exclusively in-licensed.
Our communications test and control products help customers test their fiber optic networks and assemblies with speed and precision in both lab and production environments. Our test and measurement products accelerate the development of high speed fiber optic components like photonic integrated circuits ("PICs"), coherent receivers and short-run fiber networks. 
Our distributed fiber optic sensing products help designers and manufacturers more efficiently develop new and innovative products by measuring stress, strain, and temperature at a high resolution for new designs or manufacturing processes. In addition, our distributed fiber optic sensing products ensure the safety and structural integrity or operational health of critical assets in the field, by monitoring stress, strain, temperature and vibration in large civil and industrial infrastructure such as bridges, roads, pipelines and borders. We manufacture and sell “terahertz” (THz) products for layer thickness measurements for materials like plastics, rubber, and paint. Our THz products are used in the aerospace and automotive/EV sectors. We also provide applied research services, primarily under federally funded development programs that leverage our sensing and instrumentation technologies to meet the specific needs and applications of our customers. 
Prior to September 30, 2021, we were organized into two main reporting segments, our Lightwave segment and our Luna Labs segment. We now have one reportable segment, Lightwave, following the determination that our Luna Labs segment met held-for-sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria at the end of the third quarter of 2021. Our Lightwave segment consists of our fiber optics testing, measurement and sensing solutions. On March 8, 2022, we completed the sale of substantially all of our equity interests in Luna Labs. Prior to the sale, our Luna Labs segment performed applied research principally in the areas of sensing and instrumentation, advanced materials, optical technologies and health sciences.
Dispositions and Acquisitions
Luna Labs
On March 8, 2022, we completed the sale of substantially all of our equity interests in our Luna Labs business to certain members of Luna Labs’ senior management team and a group of outside investors for an initial purchase price of $20.4 million before working capital and escrow adjustments and transaction fees. We had been actively marketing our Luna Labs segment to prospective buyers during 2021 as part of our growth strategy for our Lightwave segment. 
LIOS Sensing
On March 10, 2022, we acquired NKT Photonics GmbH and LIOS Technology Inc. (collectively, “LIOS Sensing”) for €20.0 million, or $22.1 million. LIOS Sensing, based in Cologne, Germany and formerly owned by NKT Photonics A/S, provides temperature and strain sensing products which are highly complementary to our existing portfolio of fiber optic offerings. 
Lightwave 
Our Lightwave segment develops, manufactures and markets optical measurement technologies, including the following:
•Sensing, including
–short, medium and long-range distributed fiber optic sensing solutions; and
–Terahertz, “THz” measurement products.
•Communications test and photonic control, including
–test equipment for communications devices and networks; and
–specialty laser and photonic components.

Our Lightwave segment also performs applied research principally in the areas of optical sensing and THz technologies. 
Our key initiative for long term growth is to become a leading provider of products and solutions in these two markets. For our sensing market, the acquisition of OptaSense Holdings Limited ("OptaSense") in 2020 added distributed acoustic sensing technology to our existing suite of sensing products and provided for expansion into high-growth markets such as security and perimeter detection, smart infrastructure monitoring and oil and gas. Our products have historically been strong shorter-range and discrete applications, which are best when specific, known locations need to be monitored. OptaSense's product offering has helped us fill a gap for long range, fully distributed measurement, which is best for applications where signals can occur anywhere along the length of the sensor. 
The addition of the Lios sensing portfolio brings long range, distributed temperature and strain measurement capability to our sensing solutions portfolio. This additional capability compliments our sensing products to bring what we believe is a complete set of fiber optic measurement and monitoring solutions.
Our two primary markets as described above are described in more detail below.
Communications Test and Photonic Controls Products
Test and Measurement Equipment for Fiber Optic Components and Sub-Assemblies
    Our optical test and measurement products primarily serve the telecommunications industry, as well as provide valuable applications in other fields. Our test and measurement products test and monitor the integrity of fiber optic network components and sub-assemblies. These products are designed for manufacturers and suppliers of optical components and sub-assemblies allowing them to reduce development, test and production costs and improve the quality of their products. 
Our products are particularly useful for characterizing and testing photonic integrated circuits, such as silicon photonics components, which are a critical technology enabling the growing worldwide demand for internet connectivity. Most manufacturers and suppliers of optical components and modules currently use a combination of different types of optical test equipment to measure performance and identify failures in optical networks, such as bad splices, bends, crimps and other reflective and non-reflective events that can cause defects and negatively impact product performance. Our optical test equipment products eliminate the need to employ multiple test products by addressing all stages of the end user’s product development lifecycle, including design verification, component qualification, assembly process verification and failure analysis.
Polarization Control
    Our polarization control products include components, modules and instruments to measure, manage and control polarization and group delay in fiber optic networks. The laser light that is used in all modern fiber communication and other photonic architectures is polarized in nature. We manufacture the tools used to measure, monitor and manipulate the polarization of laser light in a fiber optic system or network. 
Our proprietary fiber optic squeezing technology enables a high- performance polarization control and measurement system for the accurate measurement of polarization properties of light sources and optical materials. We also manufacture and sell fiber optic coils for use in gyroscopes.
Tunable Lasers
    Our swept tunable lasers are integrated into current and new products to help customers build faster, more flexible and cost-effective test and measurement products. Our laser has desirable properties in the quality of the laser light produced, the speed at which it can operate, the small size of the package, and the environmental conditions in which it can operate, making it possible to bring these capabilities out of the laboratory, and into more demanding environments such as aircraft structural health monitoring, automotive manufacturing, green energy and industrial applications.
We have developed and/or licensed all of the intellectual property related to our tunable lasers and we manufacture them. These lasers are used in our various different product platforms and are also sold as OEM modules to our customers in applications including fiber sensing and medical robotics.
Single Frequency Lasers
Through the acquisition of OptaSense, we acquired laser manufacturing capabilities for a range of highly coherent, integrated, very narrow line-width lasers for use in long range sensing applications. These lasers are manufactured under our “RIO” trade name and are used as the primary light source for our long range, DAS sensing products. We also sell these lasers as OEM components to other sensing and Light Detection and Ranging ("LiDAR") system manufacturers.

Sensing and Non-Destructive Test Products
ODiSI Sensing Solution
    Our ODiSI products provide fully distributed strain and temperature measurements delivering an extraordinary amount of information by using an optical fiber as a continuous sensor to produce measurements every millimeter for a sensor up to 50 meters in length (x8 sensors per system). Compared to traditional sensing methods, such as electrical strain gages, this technology provides greater insight into the performance, tolerances and failure mechanisms of composite structures and vehicles and can be integrated into locations and environments not accessible with traditional sensors. We believe our ODiSI products provide exceptional value to the aerospace and automotive industries as they continue to adopt electrification and move to lighter weight systems made of composite structures.
ODiSI incorporates multiple channels of fiber optic sensors whose inputs are integrated through an advanced measurement system and software using fiber optic sensing technology with our innovative monitoring system that allows several thousand sensors to be networked along a single optical fiber.
Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) System
Our DTS system, which we acquired as part of the LIOS business, monitors temperature over long distances or across large surfaces, such as submarine or underground power cables, by using a single strand of optical fiber as a sensor as an alternative to installing countless numbers of conventional sensors. DTS uses light scattering in the fiber to measure temperature. Because the DTS system can accurately locate the position down the length of the fiber that the scattering is originated, temperature can be mapped with high precision and accuracy over very long lengths.
DTS provides a long range, fully distributed temperature and strain sensing capability that complements our legacy offerings, brings a diverse, blue-chip customer base, representing a significant opportunity for cross-selling, expands our intellectual property portfolio, augments our international presence, building upon our already strong international customer base and sales capability, generates rapid expansion opportunities into high-growth markets such as green energy power generation, smart infrastructure monitoring and oil and gas, and leverages our acquisition of LIOS to grow our operations, customer base, offerings, and financial profile.
Because DTS uses passive optical fibers as distributed sensors, a LIOS sensing system is immune to vibration, electromagnetic noise, dust, cryogenic temperatures, and moisture. Our DTS sensing systems have been installed worldwide in critical applications such as fire detection in road and rail tunnels, special hazardous buildings, power cable and aerial transmission line monitoring, in oil & gas exploration, and in industrial induction furnaces and LNG tanks.
Hyperion Sensing Solution
Our Hyperion sensing products expand our capabilities in fiber optic sensing by providing distributed sensing using hundreds of Fiber-Bragg Grating ("FBG") or Extrinsic Fabry-Perot ("FP") sensors integrated into long-rage sensors of up to 40km in length, measured at sampling rates up to 5KHz. Hyperion enables rapid full-spectrum data acquisition and flexible peak detect algorithms of FBGs, Long Period FBGs and FP sensors with low-latency access to data for closed-loop feedback applications. Our Hyperion products target fiber optic sensing applications that require more dynamic measurement capabilities or longer distances than provided by our ODiSI platform, like monitoring of large, civil and industrial infrastructure. 
Terahertz Sensing Systems
    Our THz gauging and imaging product line uses pulsed THz waves to provide precise single- and multi-layer thickness, density, basis weight and caliper thickness measurements to serve the industrial, non-destructive testing, and research markets. Similar to x-ray images, THz wavelengths penetrate through most non-conductive materials and can easily reveal imperfections such as voids, cracks, and density variations. THz offers a significant advantage over x-rays because the radiation is non-ionizing and thus is completely safe.  THz technology, unlike other traditional methods, is non-contact, works with both opaque and translucent materials, and works well for multilayer structures. The ability to accurately measure layer thickness is critical for ensuring consistent quality, minimizing defects and reducing material usage for products such as tubing, tires, plastic bottles, adhesives and coatings. Handheld THz sensors can measure and scan specialty coatings and multilayer structures to check thickness consistency and locate subsurface defects. THz systems can be used to inspect the high-performance coatings used on military aircraft, verifying thickness of applied coatings with submicron accuracy.

Distributed Acoustic Sensing Products
Our line of advanced DAS interrogator units delivers superior measurements for a wide range of applications from advanced industrial monitoring through high performance geophysical measurements. Applications of these units include real-time pipeline monitoring preventing disruption flow, advance monitoring and evaluation of reservoir and wellbore to reduce risk and optimize recovery, real-time information detection on highways and railways for traffic management and ensuring safety, cost-effective surveillance of borders and national assets and the precise detection of faults in power and utility infrastructure. Our DAS operations include a market leading laser technology company that supports and vertically integrates the most critical element of the DAS system, its internal laser. 
Sales and Marketing
    We primarily market our fiber optic test, measurement and control products to telecommunications companies, defense agencies, government system integrators, researchers, original equipment manufacturers, distributors, testing labs and strategic partners worldwide. We have a regional sales force that markets and sells our products directly as well as through manufacturer representative organizations to customers in North America and through partner and distribution channels for sales outside of North America, including the EMEA, LATAM and APAC regions. We have a dedicated sales force for direct marketing of our distributed sensing products, with an initial focus on customers in the automotive, aerospace, and energy industries.
    We sell and market our THz instruments primarily to original equipment manufacturers through a mix of technical sales engineers, value added resellers and independent sales representatives. We market these products and capabilities through industry specific channels, including the internet, industry trade shows and through trade journals.
    We believe that we provide a high level of support in developing and maintaining our long-term relationships with our customers. Customer service and support are provided through our offices and those of our partners that are located throughout the world.
Intellectual Property
    We seek patent protection on inventions that we consider important to the operations of our business. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We control access to our proprietary technology and enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and confidentiality agreements with other third parties.
    Our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain, maintain and enforce patent and trade secret protection for our products, including successfully defending our patents against third-party challenges both in the United States and in other countries. We will only be able to protect our technologies from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that we own or have licensed valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover them. Furthermore, the degree of future protection of our proprietary rights is uncertain because we may not be able to obtain patent protection on some or all of our technology and because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage.
    Currently, we own or license approximately 745 U.S. and international patents and approximately 68 U.S. and international patent applications. Our issued patents generally have terms that are scheduled to expire between 2023 and 2042. The patents scheduled to expire in 2023 are not expected to have a significant impact on our revenues or results of operations. Patents may not be issued for any pending or future pending patent applications owned by or licensed to us. Claims allowed under any issued patent or future issued patent owned or licensed by us may not be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technologies. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us now or in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and, in addition, the rights under such patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. To the extent we elect to pursue, intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture or increase their market share with respect to related technologies.
    A discussion of our material in-licensed patents is set forth below.
Shape Sensing Patents
    As a part of our sale of assets associated with our fiber optic shape sensing technology in the medical field to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. ("Intuitive") in 2014, we transferred our related patents to Intuitive. Also, as a part of this transaction, we entered into a license agreement with Intuitive pursuant to which we have the right to use all of our transferred technology outside the field of medicine and in respect of our existing non-shape sensing products in certain non-robotic medical fields. The license is 
Table of Contents

revocable with ability to remedy, but only in the case that Luna were to enter competitively into the medical robotics space. Two U.S. patents that we now license back from Intuitive cover the use of optical frequency domain reflectometry and multiple, closely spaced Bragg gratings for shape sensing, and the use of the inherent scatter as a strain sensor for shape sensing. These two patents expire in July 2025. We also license back from Intuitive patents and patent applications that cover certain refinements to the measurements covered in the foregoing two patents and related technologies, which are necessary in order to achieve the necessary accuracies for medical and other applications. These patent applications were filed in the United States, the European Patent Office, China, India, Russia, Brazil, Japan, Indonesia and elsewhere. These patents and patent applications can support other nonmedical applications of our fiber optic shape sensing technology.
Corporate History
We were incorporated in the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1990 and reincorporated in the State of Delaware in April 2003. We completed our initial public offering in June 2006. Our executive offices are located at 301 1st St SW, Suite 200, Roanoke, Virginia 24011 and our main telephone number is (540) 769-8400.
Competition
We compete with a variety of companies in several different product markets. The products that we have developed or are currently developing will compete with other technologically innovative products, as well as products incorporating conventional materials and technologies. We expect that we will compete with companies that manufacture test and measurement equipment for a wide range of industries, including aerospace, defense, healthcare, telecommunications, energy (including oil and gas and green energy), industrial measurement, and security applications. Although there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so, we believe that we compete favorably in these areas because our products leverage advanced technologies to offer superior performance. If we are unable to effectively compete in these areas in the future, we could lose business to our competitors, which could harm our operating results.
We also compete, or will compete, for government, university and corporate research contracts relating to a broad range of technologies. Competition for contract research is intense and the industry has few barriers to entry. We compete against a number of in-house research and development departments of major corporations, as well as a number of small, limited-service contract research providers and companies backed by large venture capital firms. The contract research industry continues to experience consolidation, which has resulted in greater competition for clients. Increased competition might lead to price and other forms of competition that could harm our operating results. We compete for contract research on the basis of a number of factors, including reliability, past performance, expertise and experience in specific areas, scope of service offerings, technological capabilities and price.
Government Regulation
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulation
    Our facilities and current and proposed activities involve the use of a broad range of materials that are considered hazardous under applicable laws and regulations. Accordingly, we are subject to a number of domestic and foreign laws and regulations and other requirements relating to employee health and safety, protection of the environment, product labeling and product take back. Regulated activities include the storage, use, transportation and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous or potentially hazardous materials and wastes. Our current and proposed activities also include potential exposure to physical hazards associated with work environment and equipment. We could incur costs, fines, civil and criminal penalties, personal injury and third-party property damage claims, or we could be required to incur substantial investigation or remediation costs, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or requirements. Liability under environmental, health and safety laws can be joint and several and without regard to fault. There can be no assurance that violations of environmental, health and safety laws will not occur in the future as a result of the inability to obtain permits in a timely manner, human error, equipment failure or other causes. Environmental, health and safety laws could also become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations, which could harm our business. Further, violations of present and future environmental, health and safety laws could restrict our ability to expand facilities and pursue certain technologies, as well as require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur potentially significant costs to comply with environmental, health and safety regulations and other requirements.
    We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to comply with current and future environmental, health and safety laws. We anticipate that we could incur additional capital and operating costs in the future to comply with existing environmental, health and safety laws and new requirements arising from new or amended statutes and regulations. In addition, because the applicable regulatory agencies have not yet promulgated final standards for some existing environmental, health and safety programs, we cannot at this time reasonably estimate the cost for compliance with these additional requirements. The 
Table of Contents

amount of any such compliance costs could be material. We cannot predict the impact that future regulations will impose upon our business.
Human Capital Management
    We seek to fulfill our mission by attracting talented people, fostering innovation and managing aspects of our business in an ethical manner that benefits our stakeholders, including the communities in which we operate. We promote and empower a diverse workforce who are dedicated to helping solve our customers’ toughest challenges. As of December 31, 2022, we had 337 full-time employees and 7 part-time employees, including approximately 23% employed in research, development and engineering positions, approximately 52% employed in operations, approximately 11% employed in sales and marketing, and approximately employed 14% in administrative positions. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
