 Overview
 We are a clinical-stage, next-generation gene editing company harnessing high-efficiency targeted gene integration to develop a new class of therapies to potentially cure a wide range of serious and life-threatening diseases. Our precision gene editing approach aims to achieve one of medicine’s most elusive goals: to precisely “find & replace” any gene in the genome. We have a next-generation gene editing platform that is designed to precisely correct mutations, replace entire disease-causing genes with normal genes, or insert new genes into predetermined, safe locations. We believe our approach could enable broad applications to transform human health, including directly correcting mutations, engineering cells to permanently deliver therapeutic proteins, and precisely engineering effector cells to treat or cure a wide range of serious genetic and other diseases, including cancer, autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases.
In January 2023, we announced a voluntary pause of our Phase 1/2 CEDAR study of our lead product candidate nulabeglogene autogedtemcel (nula-cel, formerly GPH101) for sickle cell disease (SCD) due to a serious adverse event in the first patient dosed, which we concluded is likely related to study treatment. In February 2023, we announced our decision to discontinue the development of nula-cel and initiate a process to explore strategic alternatives. Nula-cel was designed to provide a highly differentiated approach with the potential to directly correct the mutation that causes sickle cell disease (SCD) and restore normal adult hemoglobin (HgbA) expression. Curing sickle cell disease by correcting the disease-causing point mutation to normal is viewed as the gold-standard for curing SCD and has been the dream of treating physicians for generations.
Our technology builds on first-generation proven CRISPR technology to achieve high rates of targeted gene integration. Our platform technology includes patent rights and proprietary technology exclusively licensed from The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University (Stanford) and developed in the Stanford laboratories of two of our scientific founders, both pioneers in gene therapy and gene editing: Matthew Porteus, M.D., Ph.D., and Maria Grazia Roncarolo, M.D. Dr. Porteus is considered to be one of the founders of the field of gene editing and was a scientific founder of CRISPR Therapeutics AG. He was the first to demonstrate that an engineered nuclease could be used to correct genes by harnessing precision cellular DNA repair machinery. Dr. Roncarolo is a pioneer in multipotent hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy and her work led to the first approved HSC gene therapy product. She established and is Director of the Stanford Center for Definitive and Curative Medicine to treat patients with currently incurable diseases through the development of innovative stem cell- and gene-based therapies. Drs. Porteus and Roncarolo, both practicing physicians, came together with the conviction that targeted gene integration could lead to an entirely new class of potentially curative therapies.
Our approach has broad therapeutic applications and has enabled high-efficiency targeted gene integration in a wide range of primary human cell types. In our initial programs, we applied our approach ex vivo in a patient’s own HSCs which are reinfused after gene integration (autologous HSCT). HSCs are multipotent stem and progenitor cells that can give rise to all cells of the blood and immune system and have proven their curative potential across dozens of diseases as demonstrated by allogenic HSC transplant (allo-HSCT). 
Our approach can be thought of as “find & replace,” using CRISPR to find a target gene and homology directed repair (HDR) to replace DNA in the target gene with DNA copied from a template. We create a precise incision in a target gene using a modified, high fidelity CRISPR-based nuclease and then induce conditions in target cells that overwhelmingly favor HDR, a natural and precise cellular DNA repair process. Using a non-integrating AAV6 vector, we deliver a donor DNA template strand to the target gene which is copied via HDR to create a new coding strand. We then apply our HSC biology expertise to optimally engineer and manufacture HSCs, a historically intractable cell type for harnessing HDR. Using our next-generation gene editing approach, we have achieved gene integration efficiencies in excess of expected curative thresholds and demonstrated preclinical proof-of-concept across models of multiple diseases. Beyond nula-cel, which leverages our gene correction technology, we have previously pursued multiple programs such as GPH102 for beta-thalassemia and GPH201 for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome (XSCID), which leveraged our gene replacement technology; GPH301 for Gaucher disease and an early-stage research program for alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, which leveraged our targeted gene insertion technology; and multiple undisclosed programs in both HSCs and other cell types. Given these programs use the same gene editing platform technology as nula-cel, we do not currently intend to continue development of these programs.
Our approach differs from first generation gene and base editing technologies due to:
•Direct targeting and correction of genetic lesions: We harness HDR to replace the disease-causing mutation or the entire disease-causing gene with the normal, wild-type genetic sequence. This is in contrast to first generation gene editing approaches that have focused on knocking-out genes. 


•Efficiency of targeted gene integration: In our nula-cel sickle cell gene correction program, we have demonstrated up to approximately 70% gene correction efficiency in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in ex vivo studies. In gene replacement and targeted gene insertion applications, we have consistently demonstrated efficiencies of approximately 30-50% in HSPCs across a range of gene targets and templates in preclinical studies. We believe these efficiencies are above the expected curative threshold for a broad array of indications, including SCD. Prior to the development of our gene integration platform, efficiencies using HDR in HSPCs were approximately 10%. 
 •Breadth of applications: We can replace genes of up to 4 kilobases (kb) allowing us to correct not only single point mutations but also multiple mutations within the same gene, and to address gene deletions. We can also precisely insert genes under control of a native promoter for naturally regulated expression, into a safe harbor location under the control of an exogenous promoter, or under the control of a lineage specific cellular promoter.
 •Uniquely suited to expand the patient population eligible for potential one-time curative HSC therapies: We believe that the high efficiency and precision of our targeted gene integration platform could potentially reduce threshold bone marrow engraftment levels. This could potentially obviate the need for full chemotherapeutic myeloablative bone marrow conditioning (the current standard for allo-HSCT and most gene editing and gene therapy approaches in development). In addition, our approach is designed to avoid the theoretical risk of insertional oncogenesis, an increased risk of cancer that can arise from the insertion of a functional gene near a gene that is important in cell growth or division results in uncontrolled cell division, from integrating viral vectors. Our approach also incorporates a high fidelity CRISPR-based nuclease for potentially improved safety. Pairing these advantages with targeted and safer bone marrow conditioning could bring HSC-based curative therapies to much larger numbers of patients. 
 We believe our technology can be applied in the following three key settings: Gene Correction, Gene Replacement, and Targeted Gene Insertion.



Gene Correction
Our approach is designed to allow us to precisely correct pathogenic genes by directly targeting and correcting the specific disease-causing mutation to restore the normal, wild-type sequence.
In January 2023, we announced a voluntary pause of our Phase 1/2 CEDAR study of nula-cel, our lead product candidate for sickle cell disease (SCD), due to a serious adverse event in the first patient dosed, which we concluded is likely related to study treatment. In February 2023, we announced our decision to discontinue the development of nula-cel and initiate a process to explore strategic alternatives.
Nula-cel is designed to directly correct the genetic mutation responsible for SCD. The mortality and morbidity associated with SCD, all caused by a single mutation, has made curing SCD a dream of many clinicians. Multiple genetic therapies are in development to address SCD, but due to technical limitations, these therapies are primarily focused on expressing alternate hemoglobin genes such as fetal hemoglobin (HgbF) or a transgenic hemoglobin. Our approach is the first in industry to directly correct the SCD-causing mutation by replacing it with the natural genetic sequence to thereby reduce harmful sickle hemoglobin (HgbS) production and restore normal adult hemoglobin (HgbA) expression. We have optimized our process to correct the majority of HSPCs. Of the remaining cells, which are not corrected, many contain two INDEL sickle globin alleles (knockout alleles). These knockout stem cells are not able to produce sickle red blood cells, and have the effect of increasing the proportion of functional stem cells which have been corrected. This increases

our confidence in our ability to exceed the 20% expected curative threshold in patients. Under IND-enabling GMP manufacturing conditions, we can precisely correct the SCD mutation in over 55% of treated cells, which we believe can achieve the threshold required to cure patients (estimated to be engraftment of 20% corrected cells). These treated HSPCs are fully functional and can engraft in vivo in a humanized mouse, and can produce functionally normal red blood cells expressing normal adult hemoglobin ex vivo. Furthermore, we have demonstrated in a mouse model of SCD that our approach significantly increased normal HgbA expression, reduced HgbS production, extended red blood cell (RBC) lifespan from two days in sickle mice to up to 19 days in gene corrected mice, and eliminated RBC sickling. We believe this data supports the curative potential of our approach.
 Gene Replacement
Our gene replacement approach is designed to allow us to replace dysfunctional genes with a new normal copy of an entire gene at its normal location in the chromosome. We had initiated two gene replacement programs, one for beta-thalassemia and another for XSCID. Given these programs use the same gene editing platform technology as nula-cel, we do not currently intend to continue development of these programs mentioned below.
 •Our research program, GPH102 for the treatment of beta-thalassemia, leverages our gene replacement platform technology by replacing one or both copies of the mutated beta-globin (HBB) gene through HDR to restore HgbA expression to levels similar to healthy individuals who do not have disease or to individuals who carry one copy of the mutated HBB gene (beta-thalassemia trait). Our approach contrasts with alternative and indirect approaches in development that seek to induce HgbF expression or produce transgenic hemoglobin from a randomly integrated transgene. We believe that, if approved, GPH102 has the potential to produce levels of HgbA expression sufficient to normalize physiology (normal or beta-thalassemia trait levels), even in the most severe forms of beta-thalassemia (/); can lead to the production of normal HgbA to preserve oxygen delivery to tissues, in contrast to HgbF; and can support highly precise integration into the native promoter, in contrast to random integration that could present risks of insertional oncogenesis. 
 •GPH201 is an investigational treatment for XSCID, a rare, life-threatening disease where multiple mutations in a single gene (IL2RG) prevent normal immune system function. We believe our gene replacement approach leading to normal regulated expression of the IL2RG gene could be an optimal cure for XSCID. We believe that the survival advantage of the progeny of gene edited cells combined with our high efficiency of gene replacement could enable patients to benefit from GPH201 without undergoing chemotherapy-based conditioning. We have an agreement with Jasper Therapeutics, Inc. (Jasper) to investigate the potential use of JSP191, Jasper’s clinical-stage non-genotoxic HSC targeted antibody-based bone-marrow conditioning (non-genotoxic HSC targeted conditioning, or NGTC) regimen, with GPH201. We and Jasper will each retain commercial rights to our respective technologies under the agreement. We believe that GPH201 will generate preliminary data on combining our autologous HSC therapies with NGTC, and our clinical experience could accelerate our ability to use NGTC with our other product candidates. Although XSCID is an ultra-orphan indication with a small number of severely affected patients, we believe GPH201 could address an important unmet need, and data from this program, potentially in combination with JSP191, could be informative to our platform and pipeline.
 Targeted Gene Insertion
Our technology aims to enable the targeted insertion of entire gene cassettes into chosen chromosomal locations. We believe that this could have broad therapeutic applications by allowing for permanent production of therapeutic proteins and enzymes, in specific cell lineages, and from targeted genomic locations. This approach was designed to prevent the variability in gene expression and the potential risk of insertional oncogenesis which are limitations of random gene integration approaches like using lentiviral vectors (LVV). Permanent therapeutic protein production applications of HSC targeted integration include expression of proteins and enzymes in target organs, including the nervous system (CNS) by tissue resident HSC-derived myeloid cells, as well as efficient systemic delivery of secreted proteins in the circulation. Potential applications include enzyme replacement for metabolic disease, CNS delivery of therapeutic proteins, or antibodies for neurodegenerative diseases, and production of plasma proteins for coagulation and complement disorders. However, given these programs use the same gene editing platform technology as nula-cel, we do not currently intend to continue development of the programs mentioned below.
 Our candidates developed to-date harness two genomic locations for targeted insertion, the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) safe harbor locus and the alpha globin locus:
•Our lead product candidate from our CCR5 locus technology is GPH301, which we were developing for the treatment of Gaucher disease, a genetic disorder that results in a deficiency in the glucocerebrosidase (GCase) enzyme. The CCR5 gene encodes the CCR5 protein and is considered a non-essential gene because its inactivation has been observed to have no general detrimental impact on human health. With GPH301, we insert a functional copy of the gene for GCase into the chromosomal locus of the CCR5 gene. This locus is known as a “safe harbor” both because of the lack of deleterious effects associated with gene insertions that occur there and because the expression of inserted genes can be reliably and precisely controlled by regulatory elements inserted together with the gene of interest. We use a lineage specific promoter so that GCase expression is limited to monocytes and macrophages which can migrate into tissues including crossing the blood brain barrier into the CNS. We inserted GCase into approximately 35% of targeted CCR5 alleles in HSPCs (resulting in 


approximately 50% of cells having at least one allele targeted) which in a mouse model subsequently engrafted, differentiated, and expressed GCase from macrophages at levels that could lead to a functional cure. Because HSC-derived myeloid cells can cross the blood brain barrier, we believe GPH301 may also have potential for the treatment of glucosidase beta acid (GBA)-associated (and GCase-deficient) Parkinson’s disease. This same approach can be used for therapeutic protein production in many other diseases, including other lysosomal storage diseases. We believe that proof of concept in Gaucher disease can accelerate development of a CCR5 safe harbor protein production pipeline given there are significant synergies and regulatory efficiencies because these programs will use the same RNA guide and preclinical safety assessment.
•Our second approach for therapeutic protein production harnesses the alpha-globin locus, which uses the alpha-globin promoter to express high protein levels from the red blood cell lineage and normalize plasma protein levels to potentially develop HSC-based cures and treatments. Our high-efficiency gene editing technology has been shown using human cells and/or animal models to be applicable to a broad range of HSC-based indications as well as other tissues, such as airway stem cells (cystic fibrosis), neural stem cells, pluripotent stem cells and keratinocytes (wound healing). We believe there is potential to develop therapies for other diseases based on these findings. 
We believe there is the potential for NGTC to expand the number of patients and indications addressable with precision engineered, one-time HSC-based treatments and cures. Distinct from our research collaboration with Jasper on JS191, we are evaluating and assessing additional novel conditioning agents and have initiated discovery research efforts to develop antibody-based NGTC candidates.

Our Strategy
In January 2023, we announced a voluntary pause of our Phase 1/2 CEDAR study of nula-cel for sickle cell disease due to a serious adverse event in the first patient dosed, which we concluded is likely related to study treatment. In February 2023, we announced our decision to discontinue the development of nula-cel and initiate a process to explore strategic alternatives. As a result of this decision, we announced a corporate restructuring that will result in an approximately 50% reduction in workforce. We also disclosed our intention to continue research activities associated with our early-stage non-genotoxic conditioning program, with the goal of advancing toward one or more potential development candidates.
Current Approaches to Gene Therapy and Gene Editing and Their Limitations
Background on Genetic Disorders
A genetic disorder is a disease caused by an abnormal change in a person’s DNA. Most genetic disorders are caused by a mutation in a single gene (monogenic disorder) which results in deficient or defective protein function. These mutations come in many different forms, including:
•Single point mutations—caused by a single base point mutation that causes a “misspelling” in diseases such as SCD. 
 •Multiple point mutations in the same gene—in diseases such as XSCID. 
 •Gene deletions—most or all of a gene is missing, in diseases such as beta-thalassemia. 
 •Gene expansion—extra abnormal DNA is inserted in diseases such as Huntington’s disease. 
 Mutations that cause genetic disease can either cause loss of function or a toxic gain of function of an important protein. For example, XSCID is caused by lack of functional IL2RG protein, Gaucher is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the GBA1 gene leading to dysfunctional GCase, and cystic fibrosis is caused by the lack of functional CFTR protein. Examples of toxic gain of function, where mutations can cause a protein to have an abnormal and disease-causing function, include SCD where sickle hemoglobin (HgbS), which has a tendency to polymerize in red blood cells, causes damage to the red blood cells, or Huntington’s disease where the huntingtin proteins injure neurons.
Evolution of Genetic Medicines
Genetic medicines have advanced rapidly over the past decade. Initial gene addition approaches have yielded multiple approved products. CRISPR-Cas9 approaches for gene knock-outs are now being translated into the clinic. Base editing builds upon CRISPR-Cas9 and enables targeted editing of certain point mutations.
Figure: Evolution of Genetic Medicines
  Gene Addition

In gene addition, a functional copy of a normal gene is introduced into a cell, typically by a non-integrating viral vector, to drive expression of a normal protein. Recently approved therapies use this approach for spinal muscular atrophy and mutation-associated retinal dystrophy. Other approaches use viral vectors, such as retroviruses and LVV, which randomly integrate a therapeutic gene into the genome for permanent expression.
The principal limitations of gene addition approaches are:
•limited durability for non-integrating viral vectors; 
 •risk of insertional oncogenesis for permanent integrating viral vector (e.g. LVV); 
 •variability in vector copy number per cell leading to variable gene expression; 
 •lack of normal endogenous regulation of gene expression; 
 •inability to correct the disease-causing mutation; and 
 •potentially curative only for loss of function mutations. 
 Gene Editing
Gene editing approaches using CRISPR-Cas9 or similar CRISPR nuclease-based technologies are in, or will shortly be initiating, clinical development. CRISPR-Cas9 creates double-stranded breaks in DNA which can be repaired in two primary ways: 1) non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) which creates targeted insertions or deletions (INDELs) or 2) HDR, which can precisely replace DNA at the target cut site by copying from a template. When CRISPR was first shown to be a gene editing tool in human cells, the primary goal and most powerful anticipated application was to use CRISPR with HDR to allow precise gene correction, replacement and insertion. However, repair following CRISPR overwhelmingly favors NHEJ, and due to technical challenges and limitations, efficient use of HDR was not possible in human cells. For this reason, current CRISPR nuclease-based technology is being developed using NHEJ to create INDELs that cannot repair genes, but can alter gene expression. Because RNA guides are used to target Cas9 enzyme (or other CRISPR nucleases) to specific DNA sites, gene editing has much higher precision than earlier methods of permanently modifying the genome, such as gene addition by viral vector integration, and reduces the theoretical risks of insertional oncogenesis with these methods.
CRISPR-Cas9 mediated INDEL (insertions or deletion of bases in an organism’s genome) formation is well suited to introducing new mutations that can disrupt and knock out a target gene. Because the vast majority of genetic diseases are caused by a mutation resulting in loss of function of an important protein, CRISPR INDEL approaches to potentially cure genetic diseases generally require an indirect approach to treat disease and are not able to directly correct the disease-causing mutation. For instance, in SCD, emerging approaches in preclinical and clinical development attempt to knock out Bcl11a function in order to induce fetal hemoglobin expression, rather than directly correcting the point mutation in the HBB gene that causes SCD. Three programs using CRISPR INDEL approaches are currently in clinical development, of which one program has provided initial clinical validation for the safety and potential efficacy of using such approaches for autologous cell therapies.
 The principal limitations of gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 are:
•introduces new mutations at the target; 
 •generally requires an indirect approach (i.e., knocking out another gene rather than fixing the disease-causing gene); and 
 •an indirect approach may provide clinical benefit but is unlikely to be the optimal curative approach to most serious genetic diseases. 
 Base Editing
Base editing harnesses CRISPR-Cas9 to deliver a deaminase to a target DNA site, resulting in making a single nucleotide change in the target DNA. This is potentially an advance over nuclease only approaches because it allows direct targeting of a subset of mutations that cause genetic disease. To our knowledge, no base editors have entered clinical development.

The principal limitations of base editing are:
•base editing programs currently in development can only correct two of six potential nucleotide changes (e.g., cannot change A to T (adenine to thymine) as is required to correct the sickle mutation and convert sickle hemoglobin to normal adult hemoglobin); 
 •can only correct or introduce a single point mutation at a time; and 
 •guide-independent potential off target risks to both DNA and RNA resulting from deaminases modifying bases that are not being targeted. 
 Our Next-Generation Gene Editing Approach
Our approach builds on the precision and clinical validation for current gene editing approaches to achieve an entirely new outcome—high-efficiency targeted gene integration. This has the potential to expand the therapeutic opportunities for gene editing beyond conventional gene editing and base editing to enable efficient correction of any type of disease-causing genetic lesion. Beyond gene correction and replacement, this approach is designed to allow the insertion of new therapeutic genes into cells with significantly greater precision and efficiency than existing approaches. We believe this enables broad therapeutic applications ranging from correcting mutations, engineering cells to permanently deliver therapeutic proteins, and precisely engineering effector cells to treat or cure a wide range of serious genetic and other diseases, including cancer, autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases.
Our innovative approach is a new platform technology built using our deep stem cell biology experience and proven CRISPR technology to efficiently harness a high-fidelity DNA repair process called HDR to integrate DNA copied from a DNA template into genes. Our approach can be described as “find & replace.” We employ CRISPR technology to find and cut a target gene and harness HDR to “copy and paste” replacement DNA from a template. We have demonstrated high-efficiency targeted gene integration across numerous cell types and curative potential in multiple animal models.
Our next generation gene editing technology was designed to create a precise incision in a target gene using a modified, high fidelity CRISPR-based nuclease and we then induce conditions in target cells that overwhelmingly favor DNA repair by a mechanism that relies on HDR rather than the less desirable and more error-prone repair mechanism known as non-homologous end joining or NHEJ. HDR repairs DNA using a DNA template and results in high fidelity copying of template DNA into the correction site while reducing the introduction of DNA mutations that occur with first generation NHEJ gene editing approaches. We achieve HDR-mediated repair by using a non-integrating AAV6 viral vector to deliver template DNA (also called donor DNA) to the target gene. The donor DNA contains 400 base pair DNA segments homologous to sequences (homology arms) on either side of the targeted DNA break, and up to 4 kb of new DNA sequences between these homology arms. The cell’s natural DNA repair process uses the homology arms to align the template in the correct location, and then copies and pastes the new DNA into the genome at the targeted gene cleavage site. This process enables correction or replacement of a mutated gene, or insertion of a new therapeutic gene in a precise location.
High Precision CRISPR-Based Nuclease
Our founders discovered that chemically modified guide RNAs can enhance Cas9 activity and subsequently showed that delivering Cas9 as a recombinant protein instead of as mRNA further increased cutting efficiency. These approaches are now widely used and widely considered to be state of the art for gene editing. We have continued to optimize the CRISPR component of our platform and employ an improved Cas9 enzyme with dramatically reduced off-target activity in preclinical models. We employ high fidelity (HiFi)

Cas9, which was co-discovered by our founders and for which we have exclusively licensed patent rights from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (IDT) in certain fields, to reduce off target cutting by 20-fold on average and 30-fold on average for the SCD gene in preclinical models, thus providing potential improved safety. We believe this is a unique advantage for our programs.
Harnessing HDR
Cells naturally have the ability to repair their DNA if damaged. One highly specialized repair pathway is called HDR because the cell uses a homologous template to precisely “copy and paste” DNA sequences to repair a DNA break without introducing errors. Normally, the template used in HDR comes from the sister chromosome. Because of its precision and ability to use a template, harnessing the HDR pathway to achieve therapeutic targeted gene integration has been a long-sought but elusive goal due to its potential to dramatically expand gene editing’s applications and curative potential.



To achieve “find & replace,” as described above, we deliver an optimized, synthetic DNA template via a non-integrating AAV6 viral vector which is transduced into cells. Our founders evaluated various approaches before discovering that AAV6 achieved the most efficient transduction in comparison to nine other AAV serotypes, while optimally preserving stem cell function. Our AAV6 donor DNA template was iteratively optimized to maximize the efficiency of targeted gene integration. No viral genes are present in the template, and the template itself exists only transiently in the target cell population.
Process Optimization
HDR is most active during cell division and is inefficient in slowly dividing cells like HSCs. Achieving HDR at potentially curative efficiency in HSCs has been an elusive and highly sought goal because HSCs are long-term multi-potent stem cells with broad therapeutic potential and potential lifetime durability. In our process, we use clinically validated and standard methods to isolate HSPCs from patients, which are comprised of both slowly dividing HSCs (lower rates of HDR) and more rapidly dividing progenitors (higher rates of HDR). Although edited HSPCs are the standard drug product for any gene edited autologous stem cell therapy, the therapeutic effect comes from the long-term HSCs that are a subset of the cells in the drug product. Harnessing our stem cell biology expertise, we optimized the timing of template delivery and cell culture conditions to improve gene correction frequency from approximately 20% in initial experiments to approximately 70% in human HSPCs in nula-cel, our sickle cell program. We believe this gene correction rate in

HSPCs ensures that the correction rate in the long-term stem cells can achieve the threshold required to cure patients (estimated to be engraftment of 20% corrected cells).




We believe our technology platform is revolutionary because it brings together proven individual technologies, new discoveries, and systematic process optimization to, for the first time, achieve HDR-mediated targeted gene integration at efficiencies of up to approximately 70% in human HSPCs in ex vivo studies. We have serially optimized our GMP process to retain high and potentially curative gene correction rates at clinical scale.
Our approach differs from first generation gene and base editing technologies:
•Direct targeting and correction of genetic lesions: We harness HDR to replace the disease-causing mutation or the entire disease-causing gene with the normal, wild-type genetic sequence. This is in contrast to first generation gene editing approaches that have focused on knocking-out or excising genes. 
 •Efficiency of targeted gene integration: In our nula-cel sickle cell gene correction program, we have demonstrated up to approximately 70% gene correction efficiency in HSPCs in ex vivo studies. In gene replacement and targeted gene insertion applications, we have consistently demonstrated efficiencies of approximately 30-50% in HSPCs across a range of gene targets and templates. We believe these efficiencies are above the expected curative threshold for a broad array of indications, including SCD. Prior to the development of our gene integration platform, efficiencies using HDR in HSPCs were approximately 10%. 
 •Breadth of applications: We can replace genes of up to 4 kb allowing us to correct not only single point mutations but also multiple mutations within the same gene, and to address gene deletions. We can also precisely insert genes under control of a native promoter for naturally regulated expression, into a safe harbor location under the control of an exogenous promoter, or under the control of a lineage specific cellular promoter of choice. 
 •Uniquely suited to expand the patient population eligible for potential one-time curative HSC therapies: We believe that the high efficiency and precision of our targeted gene integration platform can reduce threshold bone marrow engraftment levels. This could potentially obviate the need for full chemotherapeutic myeloablative bone marrow conditioning (the current standard for allo-HSCT and most gene editing and gene therapy approaches in development). In addition, our approach has been designed to avoid the theoretical risk of insertional oncogenesis from integrating viral vectors and incorporates a high fidelity CRISPR-based nuclease. We believe pairing these advantages with targeted and safer bone marrow conditioning could bring HSC-based curative therapies to much larger numbers of patients. 






Key Differentiated Components of Our Technology Platform
Our platform combines two powerful, well-characterized biologic approaches—CRISPR and HDR—with our HSC expertise and know-how to achieve high-efficiency targeted gene integration.
Efficient cutting with a CRISPR-based nuclease is an important first step in our process. Our founders discovered that chemically modified guide RNAs can enhance Cas9 activity and subsequently showed that delivering Cas9 as a recombinant protein instead of as mRNA further increased cutting efficiency. These approaches are now widely used and widely considered to be state of the art for gene editing. We have continued to optimize the CRISPR component of our platform as described below together with additional differentiated and proprietary components in our technology and process:
•Use of high fidelity (HiFi) Cas9 to reduce off-target DNA cleavage. One of the concerns about CRISPR-based nuclease gene targeting systems is unintended cleavage at other sites that may closely match but are not identical to the sequence targeted by the guide RNA. As shown in the figure below, we observed in our preclinical studies that a Cas9 variant, known as HiFi Cas9, can reduce off-target DNA cleavage by as much as 20-fold on average and 30-fold on average for the SCD gene with no meaningful change in the rate of on-target cleavage. We believe that this increased precision is one of the factors that could increase the safety and overall benefit/risk profile of our targeted gene integration therapies, potentially expanding patient eligibility and potential indications for our product candidates. We have exclusively licensed patent rights that cover HiFi Cas9 from IDT in certain fields. 





Figure: HiFi Cas9 had an approximately thirty-fold reduction in off-target DNA cleavage compared to wild-type Cas9.
 •Use of AAV6 to deliver DNA template. To harness HDR, we deliver a DNA template via a non-integrating AAV6 viral vector which is transduced into cells. Our founders evaluated various AAV serotypes before discovering that AAV6 achieved the most efficient transduction, or the transfer of genetic material into a cell. 
 To determine relative transduction efficiencies across AAV serotypes, human primary hematopoietic progenitors were infected with ten AAV serotypes each carrying the green fluorescence protein (GFP) reporter gene. The experiment was designed to determine relative transduction efficiency rather than to maximize transduction. As shown in the figure below, we observed that AAV6 was most efficient in comparison to nine other AAV serotypes. Our founders later discovered that additional optimization and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) electroporation prior to AAV6 transduction further enhanced AAV transduction efficiency.


Figure: AAV transduction of human primary hematopoietic progenitor cells.
 •Ability to achieve high rates of gene integration in a wide range of therapeutic cell types, including HSCs. HDR is a cellular process that is primarily active during cell replication and, for this reason, slowly dividing cells like HSCs have been historically recalcitrant to HDR based gene editing. In preclinical studies, we have shown that stimulating cell replication with growth factors, reducing cell density and other factors can increase the proportion of cells that undergo HDR and site-specific gene integration. As shown in the figure below (left), we observed that HSCs which are pre-stimulated with cytokines and subsequently cycled four times achieve approximately twice the rate of gene integration. As shown in the figure below (right), HSCs plated at 10-fold less density achieved nearly twice the rate of gene integration. We believe that this optimization is crucial to inducing the conditions that significantly favor the repair of CRISPR-Cas9-driven DNA break by HDR. 




Figure: Optimization of HSC cell culture conditions led to an increase in the rate of homologous repair and gene insertion.
 We have found that each of these optimization steps and our other know-how can contribute to the creation of a highly efficient targeted gene integration process. We have further optimized our process to maintain high levels of efficiency at clinical scale using HSPCs isolated from healthy donors.
Expanding Eligible Patients and Potential Indications: Combining Our High-Efficiency Approach with Advances in Non-Genotoxic HSC Targeted Conditioning (NGTC)
 One of our key strategic priorities is to make our potential one-time curative HSC-based therapies available, if approved, to as many appropriate patients as possible. We intend to do this by harnessing industry and internal research advances in non-genotoxic HSC targeted conditioning (NGTC) regimens. We believe the high precision and high efficiency with which we can consistently introduce genes by HDR has the potential to greatly expand the application to treat more patients and address more types of diseases for which gene editing-based therapies are feasible.
A limitation of therapies based on ex vivo genetic manipulation of HSCs is that the patient must be pre-conditioned with non-targeted, genotoxic conditioning agents, to both eliminate the dysfunctional endogenous HSCs and to create room for the modified cells to engraft and expand. This approach is standard for allogeneic bone marrow transplant (e.g., for SCD) and for approved HSC gene therapy products and has safety risks such as transient neutropenia, which necessitates prolonged hospitalization, potential fertility impairment, and the risk of secondary malignancies. These risks may reserve use of ex vivo HSC-based genetic and potentially curative therapies for diseases with limited treatment options, and for the most severely affected patients.
Applications Enabled by Our Technology
We believe our platform can be applied in the following three key settings: gene correction, gene replacement and targeted gene insertion.
•Gene Correction: Fix an existing gene by directly correcting the specific mutation in a dysfunctional gene. 
 •Gene Replacement: Replace dysfunctional genes with a new normal copy of an entire gene at its normal location in the chromosome.
 •Targeted Gene Insertion: Targeted insertion of entire gene cassettes into chosen chromosomal locations initially applied to drive permanent production of therapeutic proteins. 




Our Product Candidates
Gene Correction: nulabeglogene autogedtemcel (nula-cel) for the Treatment of SCD
Overview of nula-cel
 In January 2023, we announced a voluntary pause of our Phase 1/2 CEDAR study of our lead product candidate nula-cel due to a serious adverse event in the first patient dosed, which we concluded is likely related to study treatment. In February 2023, we announced our decision to discontinue the development of nula-cel and initiate a process to explore strategic alternatives. 
Nula-cel is a next generation gene-edited autologous HSC product candidate that is designed to directly correct the mutation responsible for SCD. The mortality and morbidity associated with SCD, all caused by a single mutation, has made curing SCD by direct gene correction a dream of many clinicians. Indeed, multiple genetic therapies are in development to address SCD, but due to technical limitations of other approaches, these therapies are primarily focused on expressing alternate hemoglobin genes such as fetal hemoglobin or a transgenic hemoglobin. Our approach is the first in industry to directly correct the SCD-causing mutation to restore normal adult hemoglobin expression.
Overview of Sickle Cell Disease
SCD is caused by a single nucleotide substitution in the gene encoding the beta subunit of hemoglobin (Hb), resulting in the production of sickle hemoglobin (HgbS). SCD is an autosomal recessive disease, meaning individuals with SCD have two copies of the mutated beta-globin gene. HgbS polymerizes in red blood cells to form rigid rod-like structures, damaging cell membranes and causing red blood cells to take on a characteristic sickle shape ultimately resulting in hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells) and vaso-occlusion (blockages in blood vessels), the two major pathophysiologic features of SCD. The anemia and vaso-occlusion cause severe symptoms, serious morbidity including multiple organ damage, and shortened lifespan.
SCD is the most common monogenic blood disorder with an estimated global incidence of over 300,000 births annually. Population estimates suggest that there are approximately 100,000 persons living with SCD in the United States with an additional 67,000 people living with the disease in the European Union. The global prevalence of the disease is estimated to be about 20-25 million. Unaffected biological parents of individuals with SCD have sickle cell trait. Sickle cell trait is the benign carrier status (one copy of normal and one copy of mutated beta-globin) of SCD present in over 100 million people worldwide.
SCD is a serious and life-threatening disease. Quality of life is often poor and life expectancy is reduced by 20-30 years. Patients experience severe, often daily symptoms of pain and fatigue, suffer from acute painful episodes often requiring hospitalization, and are at risk for serious complications and organ damage including stroke, silent cerebral infarction, osteonecrosis, renal failure, pulmonary hypertension and cardiomyopathy.
Sickle Cell Disease—Available Treatments and Unmet Needs
There are four available therapies approved by the FDA for SCD treatment: hydroxyurea, L-glutamine, and Adakveo (crizanlizumab) to reduce the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs), and Oxbryta (voxelotor) to increase hemoglobin levels and reduce hemolysis. These therapies require lifelong usage and may in some cases reduce but do not eliminate SCD’s serious symptoms or complications. None of these therapies have been shown to prevent pain or organ damage, or to increase survival. Chronic blood

transfusion therapy is another treatment option for some SCD patients. While transfusion therapy has a role in decreasing risk of stroke, a dreaded SCD complication, it has significant side effects including iron overload. Despite advancements in current care, progressive organ damage continues to cause early mortality and severe morbidity.
Allo-HSCT remains the only curative therapy for SCD and is considered the gold-standard for potentially curative therapies. The HSCT procedure ablates the patient’s endogenous HSCs that produce sickle red blood cells and replaces them with normal HSCs, typically from a matched sibling donor with sickle trait. HSCT is considered curative because donor cells contain at least one corrected copy of the beta-globin gene and produce normal adult HgbA yielding normal red blood cells, thereby preventing disease complications. HSCT with donor sickle trait cells has been shown to be curative because every red blood cell contains approximately 55% HgbA protein and 45% HgbS protein and does not sickle. In patients who have been cured by HSCT, this results in the elimination of VOCs and prevention of the progressive organ damage that leads to shortened lifespan. HSCT is the only therapy for SCD proven to have an impact on VOCs, organ damage and mortality. However, HSCT is rarely used due to the difficulty in finding a matched donor (as low as 16-19%), safety risks, including graft-versus-host-disease, and need for long-term immunosuppression.
Despite HSCT’s limitations (including approximately 90% of African Americans not having an available matched sibling donor, and the need for life-long immunosuppression), more than 150 HSCT procedures are performed in the United States annually. We believe this indicates substantial underlying demand for curative options, which is driven by SCD’s severity and the limitations of other current treatment options.
Sickle Cell Disease—Emerging Curative Treatments and Potential Limitations
Gene therapy and gene editing approaches are attractive alternatives to HSCT because a patient’s own cells (autologous cells) are genetically modified and therefore do not face the high risk of rejection or graft-versus-host disease associated with allo-HSCTs. However, it is unclear whether gene therapy (gene addition) and gene editing (HgbF induction) approaches currently in the clinic can achieve long term benefits similar to allo-HSCT, which directly replaces stem cells with HbSS genotype with normal (HbAA) or sickle trait (HbAS) stem cells from a matched sibling donor.
 Gene addition approaches coopt a LVV to semi-randomly integrate a modified gene for non-sickling beta (or gamma) hemoglobin into the genome, leaving the disease-causing sickle globin gene intact. Results from these trials are promising and demonstrate that patients treated using this approach have reduced VOC incidence, significant hemoglobin increases and reduction in hemolysis. However, the random insertion of newly introduced genes raises safety concerns for a potential increased risk of tumorigenesis. Use of viruses such as LVV to insert genes also results in a high variability in the number of gene copies that are inserted into the genome. This leads to variable expression levels of transgenic hemoglobin such that a significant proportion of red blood cells may not be protected. Finally, LVVs have a biologic preference for integrating into the introns of actively expressed genes, which could cause long-term perturbations of HSC function that may take years to manifest themselves.
A different, yet indirect, approach uses CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to reduce or eliminate the suppression of HgbF expression, thereby increasing HgbF levels. As with LVV gene addition, this approach also leaves the disease-causing sickle mutation intact. The rationale for this approach is that rare patients with naturally occurring elevated HgbF levels may have reduced or minimal SCD symptoms. Data available on three treated patients suggests that this HgbF induction also reduces the rate of VOCs and results in significant hemoglobin increases and reduction in hemolysis. HgbF serves to transfer oxygen from the maternal blood stream to the fetus because it has a higher oxygen affinity compared to adult hemoglobin. HgbF is normally expressed only in the fetus and replaced by HgbA within one year of birth. Due to its abnormally elevated oxygen affinity for adults, prolonged elevated HgbF expression may result in adverse physiological consequences. Additionally, HgbF has not been shown to have an impact on end organ damage, which is the main cause of early mortality in patients with SCD.
 Therefore, we believe that current gene editing and gene addition approaches, while promising, stop short of correcting the underlying disease-causing mutation and addressing all of the complications associated with the disease, which remains the ultimate goal of a curative therapy for SCD.
Nula-cel
 Although we have discontinued the development of nula-cel in SCD, nula-cel was the first targeted genetic therapy in clinical development designed to efficiently and precisely correct the disease-causing gene, simultaneously eliminating HgbS production and restoring normal HgbA expression. At the DNA level, we believe this is the first approach in the industry that seeks to convert an SCD genotype (two genes with sickle mutations, HbSS) to a normal genotype (at least one normal beta-globin gene). By correcting the SCD-causing mutation, our next-generation gene editing approach has the potential to overcome a major limitation of current gene addition

and gene editing approaches that take an indirect approach. Our goal with nula-cel is to replace a sufficient quantity of a patient’s HSCs with gene corrected cells to definitively cure SCD.




Figure: nula-cel removes the mutated region of HbS and replaces it with that of a normal hemoglobin gene.
 In order for this approach to be curative in patients, it is not necessary to correct all sickle globin genes nor to correct all HSPCs. Because sickle cell trait individuals have benign SCD carrier status, correcting one out of the two sickle globin genes in a cell is sufficient to correct that cell. Furthermore, to cure the disease, it is not necessary to correct all SCD HSPCs. In patients who received allo-HSCT from a matched sibling donor with sickle trait—long-term, persistent mixed donor chimerism where only 20% of HSCs have normal hemoglobin resulted in cures, and clinical benefits were observed with as low as 5% corrected cells. Per the figure below, we have shown under IND-enabling GMP manufacturing conditions that we can achieve correction (meaning one or more corrected copies of the sickle globin gene) in over 55% of treated HSPCs, which we believe to be well above the predicted curative threshold.



Figure: We have shown that under IND-enabling GMP manufacturing conditions, we can achieve HbS gene correction above the predicted threshold required for cure.
 We believe that nula-cel has the potential to be the optimal curative approach, because it is designed to directly correct the mutation responsible for SCD and restore normal biology by eliminating HgbS production and restoring HgbA expression. Based on existing allo-HSCT data, this supports nula-cel’s potential to address the complications associated with the disease and provide a definitive cure.
Preclinical Data
We have used both healthy donor and sickle cell disease patient-derived hematopoietic stem cells in our preclinical studies. Although correction of the sickle mutation requires sickle hematopoietic stem cells, we can also perform the same process on cells from healthy donors because the DNA template introduces additional silent (no change to amino acid coding sequence) nucleotide changes by HDR. Overall, our data highlight that HBB (beta-globin) gene correction is equivalent in healthy donor as well as sickle cell disease patient-derived hematopoietic stem cells.

We have taken three experimental approaches to generate preclinical proof of concept data for nula-cel. The first approach evaluates HDR efficiency in HSPCs from healthy donors subsequently measuring both the frequencies of HBB allele editing in the bulk population and edited cell HBB genotypes (e.g., the percentage of cells with at least one corrected allele). The second approach corrects the HbS gene in HSPCs isolated from patients, then measures the function of treated cells both ex vivo and in a humanized mouse model. The third approach corrects the HbS mutation in HSCs from a sickle mouse model and assesses corrected cells’ ability to modify the disease.



In experimental approach 1, illustrated in the left panel of the figure below, HSPCs were isolated from healthy donors. We then used CRISPR to target HBB alleles and then introduced silent mutations by HDR from the AAV6-delivered donor DNA template, a process equivalent to the intended process for clinical samples. In these healthy donor cells, HDR modified HBB alleles are equivalent to corrected alleles, and unchanged alleles are equivalent to sickle alleles. Over 40% of HBB alleles were corrected, approximately 40% had INDELs, and approximately 20% of HBB alleles remained unchanged. We anticipate from this experiment that creating INDELs in the HbS gene may be beneficial to SCD patients because INDELs may prevent sickle hemoglobin expression through knockout of the HbS gene, and stem cells containing biallelic sickle globin INDELs will not be able to produce sickle RBCs. To understand the impact of corrected and INDEL alleles on stem and progenitor cell genotype, and on the probability of achieving the predicted curative threshold of 20% corrected cells, we next genotyped individual stem and progenitor cell colonies. Results are shown in the right panel of the figure below. We observed that 40% of corrected alleles translated into 56% of stem cells being the equivalent of corrected (monoallelic or biallelic HDR), 23% are equivalent of sickle (unchanged), and 21% are knockout (INDEL/INDEL). Because knockout stem cells do not make functional RBCs, the proportion of functional corrected stem cells is approximately 70% (56% corrected colonies divided by 79% colonies that can make normal adult hemoglobin), which is well above the expected curative threshold of 20%. Thus, our approach of both knocking out the disease-causing mutation and applying subsequent gene correction to restore the HbA gene has the potential to lead to higher than anticipated cell correction rates and increases our confidence in the ability to exceed the expected curative threshold.



SCD Patient Derived HSPCs
In experimental approach 2, HSPCs were isolated from SCD patients and edited utilizing a process similar to the intended process for clinical samples, as illustrated below in the left panel of figure below. Due to our optimized process, over 60% of HbS alleles were

corrected, approximately 20% had INDELs and only approximately 10% of HbS alleles remained intact. We believe that the INDELs may be beneficial to SCD patients since INDELs prevent expression of sickle hemoglobin from the uncorrected intact HbS genes.
Next, these edited HSPCs were differentiated into red blood cells ex vivo and their hemoglobin expression was measured. As illustrated in the middle panel of the figure below, analysis of HgbA and HgbS expression (subtracting background HgbF levels) showed over 90% normal hemoglobin A and only approximately 10% sickle hemoglobin. We believe this result was better than expected for sickle trait, where red blood cells contain 55% HgbA protein and 45% HgbS protein, because INDEL formation in uncorrected sickle alleles eliminated most HgbS expression. As illustrated in the right panel of the figure below, when transplanted into immunodepleted NSG mice, these cells engrafted in a long-term (16 weeks), stable fashion with approximately 30% of sickle alleles corrected. This translates into approximately 40% of the long-term HSCs being corrected by containing at least one corrected sickle allele, double the expected curative threshold in humans. We can measure corrected alleles more directly than corrected cells; the curative threshold based on corrected alleles is anticipated to be approximately 15% because the percent of cells that have at least one corrected allele is approximately 1.3 times higher than the percent of corrected alleles. Possible reasons for the approximately two-fold difference in gene correction between the infused HSPCs (approximately 70%) and the HSCs engrafted in the mice (approximately 35%) include that long term engrafting HSCs have lower efficiency HDR than progenitor cells that comprise the majority of HSPCs; that this is a feature specific to the mouse model; or that the gene correction process impairs functionality of some of the HSCs. Regardless of the explanation, the 30% gene correction seen in vivo in engrafting HSCs is predicted to be curative in humans.

 Mouse SCD Model (Townes Model)
The Townes model of SCD is a transgenic mouse model in which the mouse hemoglobin locus is replaced with human HbA and HbS genes. These mice express sickle cell hemoglobin and exhibit many of the symptoms of human SCD including red blood cell sickling and short red blood cell half-life. In this experimental approach HSCs were isolated from sickle mice and edited utilizing the same process as the process for human HSPCs. As illustrated in the left panel of the figure below, we observed that approximately 20% of sickle alleles were corrected in the mouse HSCs, likely because of processes that were optimized for human and not mouse HSCs. Given the estimated curative threshold in humans of 20% HSCs, we predicted that mice achieving 20% or greater correction of engrafted cells (15% of alleles) would show substantial benefit of disease features. As illustrated in the center panel of the figure below, all mice with greater than 15% allele correction showed a profile of hemoglobin expression consistent with a potential cure with over 55% HgbA protein (same HgbA level as sickle trait). Furthermore, red blood cells from gene-corrected mice had a half-life that was approximately

ten-fold longer than SCD mice. As illustrated in the right panel of the figure below, we observed that these gene-corrected red blood cells were resistant to sickling.




Figure: Gene correction in a humanized SCD mouse model resulted in over 70% normal hemoglobin expression leading to reduced red blood cell sickling.
 Nula-cel Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial
In November 2021, we initiated a Phase 1/2 open label clinical trial of nula-cel in approximately 15 patients with severe SCD. The primary objective of this trial was to assess safety. Secondary objectives of the trial were to evaluate engraftment success, gene correction rates, total hemoglobin, hemoglobin A and S, effect on clinical events such as VOCs and exploratory endpoints that could generate initial evidence of nula-cel’s ability to restore red blood cell health and have an impact on end organ damage. In January 2023, we announced a voluntary pause of our Phase 1/2 CEDAR study of nula-cel for SCD due to a serious adverse event in the first patient dosed, which we concluded is likely related to study treatment. In February 2023, we announced our decision to discontinue the development of nula-cel and initiate a process to explore strategic alternatives.
Gene Replacement: GPH102 for the Treatment of Beta-Thalassemia and GPH201 for the Treatment of XSCID
GPH102 for the Treatment of Beta-Thalassemia
 Given this program leverages the same gene editing platform technology as nula-cel, we do not currently intend to continue development of this program.
 Beta-thalassemia is a genetic disorder characterized by reduced production of beta-globin, a protein that forms functional, oxygen-carrying hemoglobin with alpha-globin (HbA, a2b2). In its most severe form, beta-thalassemia is caused by mutations in both alleles of the HBB gene. These patients fail to produce functional beta-globin, resulting in severe anemia. More than 300 beta-thalassemia mutations are known; most are small nucleotide insertions, substitutions, or deletions within or directly adjacent to the HBB gene.
The most common treatment for beta-thalassemia is chronic blood transfusions. Transfusion-dependent patients typically receive transfusions every two to four weeks. Chronic administration of blood often leads to elevated levels of iron in the body, which can cause organ damage over a relatively short period of time. Patients are often given iron chelators, or medicines to reduce iron levels in the blood, which are associated with their own significant toxicities. In developing countries, where chronic transfusions are not available, most patients die in early childhood. A treatment for anemia in adult patients with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia, Reblozyl (luspatercept-aamt), received FDA approval in 2019. While Reblozyl significantly reduced transfusion burden, it did not eliminate the need for transfusions. The only known curative therapy for beta-thalassemia is allo-HSCT, but utilization is limited by lack of matched and willing donors and need for lifelong immunosuppression. As with SCD, evidence suggests that allo-HSCT can be curative if 20% or more normal donor cells engraft.
 GPH102 leverages our platform, replacing the HBB gene via HDR to achieve a normal or beta-thalassemia trait genotype with the goal of restoring HgbA expression to levels similar to healthy individuals. Alternative genetic therapies are in clinical development to address beta-thalassemia, but in general due to technical limitations, these potential therapies are indirect and are focused on expressing alternate hemoglobin genes such as fetal hemoglobin (HgbF) or a transgenic hemoglobin without correcting the underlying genetic lesions. The principal limitations of HgbF upregulation are currently understood to be that (1) its abnormally elevated oxygen affinity may result in adverse physiological consequences in adults and (2) individual RBCs require sufficient levels of beta or beta-like

globin to prevent hemolysis. It is currently unclear whether indirect approaches such as HgbF upregulation can achieve this, especially in the most severe b0/b0 genotype. The principal limitations of transgenic hemoglobin addition approaches are currently understood to be that: (1) the LVV that delivers the transgenic gene may have a biologic preference for integrating into the introns of actively expressed genes, which could cause long-term perturbations of HSC function that may take years to manifest themselves and (2) transgenic beta-globin levels are variable between RBCs (due to variable vector copy number and integration site). Additionally, some RBCs may express insufficient transgenic beta-globin to be protective, especially in the most severe b0/b0 genotype.
 GPH201 for the Treatment of XSCID
 Given this program leverages the same gene editing platform technology as nula-cel, we do not currently intend to continue development of this program.
 GPH201 is an investigational next generation gene-edited autologous HSC product candidate for the treatment of XSCID. XSCID is a rare, life-threatening disease where multiple mutations in a single gene prevent the formation of multiple interleukin receptors resulting in defects in immune cell formation. As a consequence, severe, persistent, or recurrent early-onset infections are the hallmark of XSCID. Without treatment, infants with XSCID usually do not live beyond one year of age. Allogeneic HSCT that results in functional reconstitution of the immune system is the only curative treatment for XSCID, but the procedure has limitations including identification of an HLA matched sibling donor as well as potential complications of GvHD and subsequent poor immune reconstitution. An effective targeted genetic therapy would need to replace a large portion of the IL2RG gene in order to be effective across XSCID patients with different IL2RG mutations. The goal of GPH201 is to replace a sufficient quantity of a patient’s HSCs with gene edited cells to eliminate the symptoms of, and potentially cure, XSCID.
In preclinical studies assessing GPH201’s gene replacement efficiency, we modified HSCs from healthy males using our GPH201 process. As illustrated in the figures below, we observed an overall mean IL2RG gene replacement efficiency of approximately 45% in healthy donor-derived HSPCs. These HSCs were then engrafted in bone marrow of immunodeficient mice, where approximately 30% gene replacement was observed, indicative of long-term curative potential. We believe this level of gene replacement is well in excess of the estimated 1-5% curative threshold.



Figure: The IL2RG gene was replaced in approximately 45% of treated HSPCs from healthy donors
 To assess the potential of GPH201 to restore the ability of progenitor cells to differentiate into T cells and NK cells, we isolated HSPCs from an XSCID patient with subsequent replacement of the IL2RG gene, achieving approximately 40% gene replacement efficiency, as illustrated in the figure at left below. Upon differentiating these cells in vitro, as illustrated in the figure at right below, treated HSPCs from the XSCID patient had an approximately nine-fold increase in cells that formed T cells, B cells, and NK cells than untreated control cells.




Figure: IL2RG gene replacement in XSCID patient HSPCs led to significant increase in T cell and NK cell formation
 As a result of the selective advantage of progenitor and effector cells that express normal IL2RG, it is estimated that only 1-5% of genetically corrected HSCs would be needed to reconstitute immunity in XSCID patients. This selective advantage is highlighted by reports that rare XSCID patients have had a somatic reversion in a single precursor cell that led to reconstitution of their immune system for years. Based on the editing efficiency we have demonstrated and the low number of genetically corrected HSCs needed to potentially cure the disease, we believe that GPH201 can be curative and could be combined with a novel, safer and targeted bone marrow conditioning approach.
We have partnered with Jasper to assess GPH201 combined with targeted conditioning using JSP191, an anti-CD117 monoclonal antibody and without the use of chemotherapeutic myeloablation. Clinical data has shown that JSP191 has the potential to lead to successful engraftment in allo-HSCT for XSCID. Although XSCID is an ultra-orphan indication with a small number of severely affected patients, we believe GPH201 could address an important unmet need, and data from this program (potentially in combination with JSP191) could be informative to our platform and pipeline.
 Targeted Gene Insertion with Therapeutic Protein Production (CCR5 Safe Harbor Locus): GPH301 for the Treatment of Gaucher Disease
Given this program leverages the same gene editing platform technology as nula-cel, we do not currently intend to continue development of this program.
 Our GPH301 product candidate is a next generation gene-edited autologous HSC product candidate from our CCR5 locus technology for the treatment of Gaucher disease, an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the GBA gene which encodes GCase. GCase is an enzyme responsible for degrading glucocerebroside, a cell membrane building block, into glucose and lipids within lysosomes of cells. In patients with Gaucher disease, lack of GCase leads to accumulation of glucocerebroside in macrophages resulting in inflammation that impacts the liver, spleen and bone marrow.
Gaucher disease is the most common inherited lysosomal storage disease and is classified into three types: Type 1 disease is associated with hematologic abnormalities, enlargement of the liver and spleen and skeletal defects, which severely impact quality of life; Type 2 disease causes life-threatening neurological dysfunction in infants, who often die within the first few weeks of life; and Type 3 disease causes severe neurological complications in addition to all the symptoms associated with Type 1 disease, resulting in reduced lifespan. There are approximately 6,000 patients with Gaucher disease in the United States. 90% of Gaucher patients in the United States and Europe are classified as Type 1.
 Gaucher disease is currently treated by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), which is recombinant GCase. All of the approved ERTs are administered as biweekly infusions. Long term ERT for Gaucher disease results in lower levels of anemia, reduced bone pain, and reductions in spleen and liver enlargement, but is not curative. An alternate method of treating Gaucher disease is to block the synthesis of glucocerebroside with inhibitors rather than to accelerate its breakdown with ERT. Approved products in this category

include miglustat and eliglustat. These products are not generally as effective as ERT and have significant safety risks. HSCT is the only treatment that can provide a definitive cure for Gaucher disease and is considered prior to the onset of neurologic symptoms.
 GPH301 is designed to insert a functional copy of the gene for glucocerebrosidase (GCase) into the chromosomal location of the CCR5 gene. This locus is known as a safe harbor both because of the lack of serious deleterious effects in humans with CCR5 mutations and because the expression of genes inserted there can be precisely controlled by regulatory elements inserted together with the gene of interest. We include the CD68S promoter in the inserted gene cassette which we believe provides two advantages: 1) targeting GCase expression specifically to the disease-causing cell in Gaucher (and avoiding expression in HSCs which could affect stem cell function) and 2) macrophage expression takes advantage of the ability of gene corrected macrophages to cross the blood brain barrier and address the neuropathic manifestation of Type 3 Gaucher Disease. The goal of GPH301 is to replace a sufficient quantity of a patient’s HSCs with gene edited cells to drive GCase expression in a patient’s macrophages and reverse the accumulation of unprocessed glucocerebroside. Data from Gaucher patients with mixed donor chimerism and from mouse models support that less than 10% corrected HSCs could be curative.
In preclinical studies assessing the efficiency of our targeted gene insertion process, we isolated HSCs from healthy donors using our GPH301 process. As illustrated in the left panel of the figure below, we were able to achieve efficient gene insertion as demonstrated by approximately 35% of the targeted CCR5 alleles containing a GCase insertion. As illustrated in the center panel of the figure below, the edited, engrafted cells contain more than 10% alleles with the insertion, which corresponds to more than 15% of the cells, which is above the predicted threshold (5%-10%) for patients to achieve a cure. As predicted, because of our use of the CD68S promoter, GCase expression was restricted to monocytes and macrophages. As illustrated in the right panel of the figure below, GCase expression was two-fold higher in edited versus unedited healthy donor cells in both in vitro cultures and in cells isolated from a humanized mouse model after engraftment. We believe that this preclinical data strongly supports the curative potential of GPH301.



Figure: Insertion of the GBA gene in the CCR5 safe harbor led to the expression of GCase in monocytes.
 
We believe proof of concept in Gaucher disease could accelerate development of a CCR5 safe harbor protein production pipeline given there are significant synergies and regulatory efficiencies because these programs would use the same RNA guide and preclinical safety assessment.
Future Targeted Gene Insertion with Therapeutic Protein Production (CCR5 Safe Harbor) Opportunities
Given these future opportunities would leverage the same gene editing platform technology as nula-cel, we do not currently intend to pursue them.
 We had previously planned to pursue indications beyond Gaucher disease using our CCR5 locus technology for tissue-based protein expression, including for CNS protein delivery. Inserting different genes into this locus using the same sgRNA, integration site and homology arms could enable rapid expansion into other diseases.
Our founders have published animal or in vitro data using the CCR5 safe harbor approach in several indications, including mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I), a severe metabolic disease characterized by buildup of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) due to a deficiency of alpha-L iduraonidase (IDUA), an enzyme responsible for degradation of GAGs in lysosomes. Without IDUA, GAGs accumulate in the body leading to developmental delays, enlarged organs, neurologic damage which may lead to cognitive decline, and early death. MPS I is treated primarily by chronically administered ERT, for which CNS efficacy is limited because ERT does not cross

the blood-brain barrier. The only curative treatment for MPS I is allo-HSCT which is rarely used because of the lack of matched donors and immune complications.
To assess the efficiency of our targeted gene insertion process, we isolated HSPCs from healthy donors using a process similar to that of GPH301. As illustrated in the left panel of the figure below, we were able to achieve efficient gene insertion as demonstrated by approximately 45% of the targeted CCR5 alleles containing a phosphoglycerate kinase promoter (PGK)-IDUA insertion. While we have not optimized gene insertion for IDUA in engrafted cells, targeted cells successfully engraft in immunodepleted mice, and as illustrated in the center panel of the figure below, the edited, engrafted cells contain more than 5% alleles with the insertion, which corresponds to approximately 7% of cells. To study the IDUA enzyme activity contribution in cells containing the PGK-IDUA gene insertion, a pure population of targeted cells was measured in vitro in macrophages. Approximately 30-fold higher IDUA activity was observed versus healthy donors, as illustrated in the right panel of the figure below. We then transplanted the PGK-IDUA human HSPCs into IDUA knockout mice (an MPS I animal model) to assess in vivo IDUA activity. The serum IDUA activity in the transplanted mice was an average of approximately 3% of normal activity versus 0.05% activity in IDUA knockout mice (0.8% activity or higher is expected for clinical benefit based on patients with mild disease). Overall, these data highlight that the CCR5 safe harbor locus is a modular therapeutic protein production platform that has broad applicability for treating genetic diseases, including other lysosomal storage disorders.



Future Opportunities in Targeted Gene Insertion with Therapeutic Protein Production: Alpha Globin Locus
 Given these future opportunities would leverage the same gene editing platform technology as nula-cel, we do not currently intend to pursue them.
 For certain therapeutic applications, we believe there is an advantage to precisely inserting a gene into a location in the chromosome where we can utilize a native cell promoter that can lead to high level and lineage specific expression. One such locus is the alpha globin (HBA1) locus, in which the endogenous alpha-globin promoter can be used to express inserted genes in red blood cells or red blood cell precursors to drive therapeutic protein production. This is an attractive approach because the very high rate of red blood cell formation (200 billion produced each day), coupled with the strength of the alpha globin promoter (280 million hemoglobin molecules per red blood cell) could allow for production of normal levels of therapeutic protein with modest HSC engraftment targets (<10%) which may be achievable with non-genotoxic HSC targeted bone marrow conditioning regimens. We believe this could dramatically improve the benefit risk profile of product candidates as potential one-time HSC cures.
A number of blood diseases could potentially be cured or treated by one-time infusion of HSPCs with targeted gene insertion into the alpha globin locus. In preclinical studies, we observed a targeted insertion of a full HBB gene (which encodes the beta-globin protein) into the HBA1 locus at an approximately 40% rate in human beta-thalassemia patient-derived HSPCs, as shown in the figure at left below. Following the insertion of the HBB gene into the HBA1 locus, transplantation of these patient-derived cells into an immunodeficient mouse model resulted in long-term engraftment, as shown in the center figure below. Following differentiation of HSPCs into red blood cells, the beta globin-to-alpha globin expression ratio was approximately equivalent to the levels observed in patients with beta-thalassemia trait, as shown in the figure at right below. This targeted gene insertion approach, which explores inserting

the HBB gene into the HBA1 locus as a method to potentially treat beta-thalassemia, is different from the gene replacement approach used for our GPH102 program, which replaces the HBB gene via HDR to achieve a normal or beta-thalassemia trait genotype.

 Given high rates of protein production from our gene-targeted cells, we believe that clinically relevant therapeutics can be developed with this approach that require only modest rates of engraftment and would not require standard myeloablative conditioning. We believe that this has the potential to expand the applicability of our targeted gene insertion technology to indications for which risks of random gene integration and chemotherapeutic myeloablative conditioning would be unacceptable.
We were previously advancing an early-stage research program leveraging this approach for the treatment of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, a severe inherited genetic disorder that affects approximately 60,000 people in the United States and can cause progressive lung and liver disease. AAT is caused by a genetic mutation in the SERAPINA1 gene, which causes the liver to produce insufficient amounts of AAT protein needed to protect the lungs so they can work normally. We believe this could offer a differentiated approach to treat AAT deficiency by using targeted gene insertion to permanently increase AAT protein production. This approach has the potential to permanently normalize circulating plasma levels of AAT with a one-time treatment, in combination with mild conditioning, and avoid potential issues of durability, immunogenicity or liver toxicity with liver-targeted approaches.
Other Future Opportunities for Targeted Gene Integration in Other Cell Types and Indications
Given these future opportunities leverage the same gene editing platform technology as nula-cel, we do not currently intend to pursue them.
 We had previously explored applications of our technology platform to develop potential therapies for a number of other genetic diseases including diseases involving the hematopoietic system and other lysosomal storage diseases. We believe that our targeted gene insertion technology, through its ability to lead to the controlled expression of any gene, also has potential to treat diseases outside of monogenic diseases such as the ability to integrate genes to produce next generation CAR effector therapies or myeloid cell therapies for autoimmune disease or oncology. Our high-efficiency gene editing technology has been shown using human cells and/or animal models to be applicable to a broad range of HSC-based indications (e.g., MPS I and Krabbe) as well as other tissues, such as airway stem cells (cystic fibrosis), neural stem cells, pluripotent stem cells and keratinocytes (wound healing).
Manufacturing
We currently have no commercial manufacturing capabilities. For our initial clinical programs, we planned to use qualified third-party contract manufacturing organizations with relevant manufacturing experience in genetic medicines. We have established manufacturing processes for nula-cel and have established relationships with third-party manufacturers with capabilities to manufacture the necessary Drug Substance and Drug Product in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). We plan to continue to rely on qualified third-party organizations to produce or process bulk compounds, formulated compounds, viral vectors or engineered cells for IND-supporting activities and early-stage clinical trials if applicable. We expect that commercial quantities of any compound, vector, or engineered cells that we may seek to develop will be manufactured in facilities and by processes that comply with cGMP and relevant health authority regulations. We had previously planned that at the appropriate time in the product development process, we would determine whether to establish our own manufacturing facilities or continue to rely on third parties to manufacture commercial quantities of any products that we may successfully develop. Outside of the United States and Europe, where appropriate, we may elect in the future to utilize strategic partners, distributors or contract sales forces to assist in the commercialization of our products, or, in certain instances, we may consider building our own commercial infrastructure.
Competition
The gene therapy and gene editing fields are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on intellectual property and proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience, and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we currently face, and will continue to face, competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. For any products that we may ultimately commercialize, not only will we compete with any existing therapies and those therapies currently in development, but we will also have to compete with new therapies that may become available in the future. Key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of our gene therapies are likely to be efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience, price and reimbursement.

We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other related markets that utilize technologies encompassing genomic medicines to create therapies, including gene editing and gene therapy. There are several other companies advancing gene editing and gene therapy product candidates in preclinical or clinical development in sickle cell disease, including Beam Therapeutics Inc., bluebird bio, Inc., Cellectis SA, CRISPR Therapeutics AG, and Editas Medicine, Inc. Companies advancing gene editing and gene therapy programs in beta-thalassemia include bluebird bio, Inc., CRISPR Therapeutics AG, and Edigene Inc. Companies advancing gene therapy programs in XSCID include Mustang Bio, Inc. Companies advancing gene therapy programs in Gaucher disease include AVROBio, Inc. and Freeline Therapeutics Holdings plc. Companies advancing gene editing and gene therapy programs in preclinical development for AAT deficiency include Beam Therapeutics Inc., Editas Medicine, Inc., Intellia Therapeutics, Inc., Krystal Biotech Inc., Apic Bio Inc., and LogicBio Therapeutics Inc. Companies combining CRISPR with HDR (homology directed repair) include CRISPR Therapeutics AG, which, for oncology applications, inserts a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) construct into the TCR alpha constant (TRAC) locus in T-cells using HDR. Additionally, an academic collaboration between the University of California, San Francisco and the University of California, Los Angeles is seeking to correct the sickle cell mutation using CRISPR followed by delivery of a single-stranded oligonucleotide DNA donor to potentially harness HDR. Because these competitors, as well as other companies and research institutions, hold numerous patents in this field, it is possible that these or other third parties could allege they have patent rights encompassing our product candidates, technologies or methods. For more information regarding competition and intellectual property, please see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of our competitors. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ products may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any product we may commercialize and may render our gene therapies obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our gene therapies. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our gene therapies non-competitive or obsolete.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our platform technology, our programs, and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, in particular, our patent rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating any valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other things, exclusively licensing and filing patent applications related to our platform technology, existing and planned programs, and improvements that are important to the development of our business, where patent protection is available. Notwithstanding these efforts, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any patent applications we have licensed or filed or may license or file in the future, and we cannot be sure that any patents we have licensed or patents that may be licensed or granted to us in the future will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or that such patents will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Our wholly owned and our in-licensed patent applications cover various aspects of our genome editing platform and proprietary components, as well as our programs directed to genome modification using chemically modified guide RNAs, and non-genotoxic conditioning. We intend to continue to pursue, when possible, additional patent protection, including composition of matter, method of use, and process claims, directed to various aspects of our platform technology and the programs in our portfolio. We also have one option to license patent applications relating to stable genomic integration in primary cells with CRISPR-Cas and AAV, HSC insertion in alpha globin loci, and HDR correction of IL2RG for treatment of XSCID as well as a second option to license patent applications relating to gene integration in a safe harbor locus CCR5 to correct metabolic diseases, treatment and correction of immunodeficiency conditions, treatment of cystic fibrosis, and treatment of diseases relating via targeting and correcting the alpha globin locus. As of March 1, 2023, we owned two pending U.S. patent applications, two pending PCT patent applications, and five pending provisional patent applications. One patent family (comprising pending U.S. and PCT patent applications) relates to various aspects of treating beta-thalassemia, including specific gene cassettes and sequences for targeted insertion into particular locations in the HBB gene, gene editing components and compositions thereof for editing the HBB gene, and methods of using such compositions for modifying a patient’s cells and other gene therapies. If a U.S. patent should issue from this family, and if the appropriate maintenance fees are paid, the U.S. patent would be expected to expire in 2042, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. A second patent family (comprising pending U.S. and PCT patent applications) relates to methods to genetically engineer hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells for the expression of therapeutic proteins, including related gene editing components and therapeutic compositions and methods. If a U.S. patent should issue from this family, and if the appropriate maintenance fees are paid, the U.S. patent would be expected to expire in 2042, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. Two pending provisional patent applications relate to our Non-Genotoxic HSC Targeted Conditioning (NGTC) program, including compositions and methods for use in non-genotoxic HSC targeted antibody-based bone-marrow conditioning regimens. If a U.S. patent should issue claiming priority to either or both of these provisional applications, the U.S. patent(s) would be expected to expire in 2043, excluding

any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. Two additional pending provisional patent applications relate to methods for genotyping gene-edited hematopoietic stem cells. If a U.S. patent should issue claiming priority to either or both of these provisional applications, the U.S. patent(s) would be expected to expire in 2043, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. An additional pending provisional patent application relates to compositions and methods for enhancing homology directed repair (HDR)-mediated gene editing. If a U.S. patent should issue claiming priority to this provisional application, the U.S. patent(s) would be expected to expire in 2043, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions.
As of March 1, 2023, we in-licensed from Stanford two issued U.S. patents and two pending U.S. patent applications, issued patents in Australia, Europe and China, and pending patent applications in Australia, Canada, China, Japan and South Korea directed to methods of genome modification using chemically modified guide RNA in primary cells. The in-licensed patents and patent applications, which are jointly owned by Stanford and Agilent, also relate to methods of using such genome modifications for therapeutic indications such as SCD and thalassemia. Our current in-licensed patents and patent applications from Stanford, if the appropriate maintenance fees are paid, are expected to expire 2036, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions. The in-licensed European patent is currently subject to an opposition proceeding at the European Patent Office (EPO) Opposition Division, initiated by multiple opponents.
 As of March 1, 2023, we in-licensed two U.S. patents, two U.S. patent applications, and patent applications in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and South Korea directed to compositions involving high-fidelity nucleases, gene editing systems using mutant Cas9 nucleases, and improved methods of gene editing thereof from IDT. Our current in-licensed patent and patent applications from IDT, if the appropriate maintenance fees are paid, are expected to expire in 2037, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions.
 For more information regarding our licensed patent applications, please see the sections titled “Our Material Agreements” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies from country to country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment (PTA) which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened (e.g., if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent having an earlier expiration date). In some instances, such a PTA may result in a U.S. patent term extending beyond 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application related to the U.S. patent. Patent term extensions (PTE) under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, are also possible for patents that cover an FDA-approved drug as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a PTE of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the PTE is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. PTE cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug, a method for using it, or a method of manufacturing it, may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if our products receive regulatory approval, we may be eligible to apply for PTEs on patents covering such products, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such PTE should be granted, and if granted, the length of such PTE. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and confidential information to develop and maintain our proprietary position and protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have implemented measures to protect and preserve our trade secrets, such measures can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently

discovered by competitors. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Our Material Agreements
Service Agreement with WuXi Advanced Therapies Inc.
 In November 2022, we entered into a Master Development and Manufacturing Services Agreement (“WuXi Agreement”) with WuXi Advanced Therapies Inc. (“WuXi”), pursuant to which we agreed that, for a term of five years (which is extendable by mutual written agreement of the parties) and subject to certain conditions, WuXi and certain of its affiliates will provide product candidate development and manufacturing services on a project-by-project basis. Such services and their pricing terms will be agreed upon between WuXi and us pursuant to one or more work orders executed in accordance with the WuXi Agreement. The WuXi Agreement may be terminated by either party for any reason upon at least 90 days written notice, and we may terminate any work order under the WuXi Agreement upon at least 30 days written notice. In addition, each party has the ability to terminate the WuXi Agreement upon the occurrence of certain conditions.
 The WuXi Agreement includes customary provisions relating to indemnification, intellectual property protection, confidentiality, remedies, and representations and warranties, as well as certain quality requirements.
 On November 7, 2022, we entered into a work order under the WuXi Agreement under which we will receive services for nula-cel, manufacturing engineering test runs, the use of a manufacturing suite at WuXi’s GMP facility located in Philadelphia, PA, and Phase 1/2 CEDAR clinical development and manufacturing of nula-cel.
 Exclusive License Agreement with the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University
 In December 2020, we entered into an exclusive license agreement (the “License Agreement”), with The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University (Stanford), pursuant to which Stanford granted us a worldwide license to specified technology and patent rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize human prophylactic and therapeutic products. Other than with respect to specified, broadly applicable assays and procedures and subject to retained rights by Stanford, the license is exclusive with respect to human prophylactic and therapeutic products for the treatment of SCD, XSCID and beta thalassemia. The license is non-exclusive with respect to those broadly applicable assays and procedures and with respect to all human prophylactic and therapeutic products other than for the treatment of SCD, XSCID and beta thalassemia.
To date, pursuant to the License Agreement, we have paid an upfront license fee to Stanford of $50.0 thousand and issued to Stanford and its designees an aggregate of approximately 0.6 million shares of our common stock. The acquisition of the exclusive license, including patent rights and know-how, and clinical supplies was accounted for as an asset acquisition and as the acquired technology and inventories did not have an alternative use, the total consideration of $2.8 million was recorded as research and development expense in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2020. We are obligated to pay Stanford an annual license maintenance fee on each anniversary of the effective date of the License Agreement. The annual license maintenance fee initially is $5.0 thousand and will increase to $50.0 thousand in three increments over the first seven anniversaries of the effective date of the License Agreement. After the first commercial sale of a product falling within the scope of the license (the “Licensed Product”), the annual license maintenance fee is $200.0 thousand.
In May 2021, we issued 640,861 shares of our common stock in connection with the License Agreement. Subsequently, in June 2021, related to the License Agreement, we repurchased 624,845 shares of our common stock from investors and founders.
 We are required to share with Stanford a portion of any non-royalty income we receive from sublicensing the licensed patent rights or technology, subject to specified exclusions. With respect to sublicenses granted to products for the treatment of SCD, XSCID and beta thalassemia, the portion of sublicense income we must share with Stanford varies by indication and declines from between a mid-teen to a second quartile double-digit percentage prior to the filing of an IND to between a high single-digit to very low double-digit percentage upon achievement of a specified clinical milestone. With respect to sublicenses granted under the licensed technology rights and not licensed patent rights, the portion of sublicense income shared with Stanford declines from between a mid-single-digit and very low double-digit percentage prior to the filing of an IND to a low single-digit percentage after filing of an IND.
 We are obligated to make payments to Stanford with respect to each Licensed Product of up to an aggregate of $12.8 million upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones. Such amounts are payable only once upon the first occurrence of a particular milestone event with respect to each Licensed Product and only once with respect to each new indication covered by any of the Licensed Products.
 We also are obligated to pay Stanford low single-digit royalties based on worldwide annual net sales of any Licensed Product, subject to specified reductions. We will be obligated to continue to pay royalties on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product and country-by-country basis, until the latest of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim under the licensed patents that covers the sale or manufacture of such Licensed Product in such country, (ii) the expiration of any period of regulatory exclusivity with respect to such

Licensed Product in such country or (iii) the expiration of ten years after the first commercial sale of such Licensed Product in such country.
 The term of the License Agreement expires on the later of (i) the expiration of the last patent or abandonment of the last patent application within the license patent rights or (ii) the expiration of all royalty terms with respect to Licensed Products. The License Agreement may be terminated by us at will or by Stanford if we remain in breach of the License Agreement following a cure period to remedy the breach.
 We are required to use diligent efforts to manufacture, market and sell Licensed Products for the treatment of each of SCD, XSCID and beta thalassemia. In addition, we are required to achieve specified milestones by specified dates with respect to Licensed Products for the treatment of each of SCD, XSCID and beta thalassemia. If we fail to satisfy our diligence obligations, Stanford may terminate the License Agreement for our breach. For more details on the License Agreement, please see Note 6 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.
Option Agreements with Stanford
First Option Agreement
In January 2021, we entered into an option agreement (the “First Option Agreement”) with Stanford, pursuant to which Stanford granted us the right to obtain a license to specified patent rights relating to human prophylactic and therapeutic products. The option may be extended to specified technology at a later date and upon our agreement with Stanford. We may exercise the option in whole or in part to obtain a license under one or more of the optioned patent rights. Subject to retained rights by Stanford, the license is exclusive with respect to human prophylactic and therapeutic products for the treatment of SCD, XSCID and beta thalassemia and non-exclusive with respect to all other human prophylactic and therapeutic products.
Pursuant to the First Option Agreement, we agreed to grant Stanford 132,137 shares of our common stock if we exercise the option and execute and deliver an amendment to the License Agreement that incorporates the optioned patent rights and any optioned technology. Other than such shares of our common stock and a license execution fee of $10.0 thousand if we exercise the option with respect to a particular optioned patent right, no additional payments have been or will be made by us to Stanford under the First Option Agreement or upon the execution of an amendment to the License Agreement that incorporates the optioned patent rights and any optioned technology. The terms of the License Agreement will apply to any Licensed Products falling within the patent rights and technology licensed by us upon exercise of the option.
 The term of the First Option Agreement expires 18 months after its effective date, subject to our right to extend such expiration date by up to an additional one-year periods upon notice to Stanford and by another additional one year upon the reasonable agreement of Stanford. The First Option Agreement will terminate if the License Agreement terminates. The First Option Agreement also may be terminated by us at will. On June 23, 2022, we exercised our right to extend the term of the First Option Agreement for an additional year. As of March 1, 2023, we had not exercised the option under the First Option Agreement and no fees have been paid for the First Option Agreement.
 Second Option Agreement
In April 2021, we entered into another option agreement (the “Second Option Agreement”) with Stanford, pursuant to which Stanford granted us the exclusive right to obtain a license to specified patent rights relating to human prophylactic and therapeutic products. The option may be extended to specified technology at a later date and upon our agreement with Stanford. We may exercise the option in whole or in part to obtain a license under one or more of the optioned patent rights, subject to a specified waiting period with respect to certain specified patent rights. Subject to retained rights by Stanford and in the case of specified patent rights, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the license will be exclusive with respect to human prophylactic and therapeutic products for the treatment of Gaucher Disease, other diseases treated through insertion of a construct into the CCR5 locus, and diseases treated through insertion of a construct into the alpha globin locus. The license is non-exclusive with respect to all other human prophylactic and therapeutic products.
Pursuant to the Second Option Agreement, we agreed to pay Stanford option fees in an aggregate amount of $30.0 thousand over the term of the option. If we exercise the option with respect to a particular optioned patent right, Stanford and we would negotiate in good faith the terms of a license agreement or an amendment to the License Agreement that incorporates the optioned patent rights and any optioned technology. The terms of the license agreement or amendment could include additional payments to Stanford in excess of those set forth in the License Agreement.
The term of the Second Option Agreement expires 12 months after its effective date, subject to our right to extend such expiration date by two additional one-year periods upon notice to and the reasonable agreement of Stanford. The Second Option Agreement may be terminated by us at will or by Stanford if we remain in breach of the Second Option Agreement following a cure period to remedy the breach. The Second Option Agreement also will terminate automatically in the event of a filing of a bankruptcy petition by or against us. On April 13, 2022, we entered into an amendment to the Second Option Agreement which extended the term for an additional year

and the maintenance fee of $10.0 thousand was paid in the three and six months ended June 30, 2022. As of March 1, 2023, we had not exercised the option under the Second Option Agreement and no fees have been paid for the Second Option Agreement.
 We are required to use diligent efforts to conduct research on potential commercial applications of the optioned patents and any optioned technology. In addition, we are required to use reasonable efforts to achieve specified milestones during the term of the Second Option Agreement with respect to products incorporating two of therapeutic approaches covered by the optioned patent rights. Our diligence obligations are subject to good faith discussions regarding their modification upon any extension of the term of the Second Option Agreement by us. If we fail to satisfy our diligence obligations Stanford may terminate the Second Option Agreement for our breach.
 License Agreement with Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.
In June 2021, we entered into a License Agreement (the “IDT License Agreement”) with Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (IDT). Pursuant to the IDT License Agreement, IDT granted to us and our affiliates a worldwide, non-exclusive, sublicensable license to research and develop products incorporating HiFi Cas9 protein variants for use in human therapeutic applications for SCD, XSCID and Gaucher disease (the Field) and a worldwide, exclusive, sublicensable license to commercialize such products in the Field. We were also granted the right to expand the licensed Field to include human therapeutic applications in the additional fields of beta thalassemia disorder and lysosomal storage disorders upon the payment of an exercise fee in the amount of $0.5 million per additional field or $1.0 million for both additional fields.
We are solely responsible for the development, manufacture, regulatory approval and commercialization of the products in the Field and are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve certain regulatory and commercial milestones with respect to licensed products.
In the event we do not achieve the applicable milestones within a specified time period, then, except with respect to the field of human therapeutic applications for SCD for which we had previously filed an IND, the exclusive license granted to us described above will immediately convert to a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license, and all sublicenses granted by us to any sublicensees will immediately terminate.
In consideration of the licenses and rights granted to us under the IDT License Agreement, we agreed to pay to IDT an upfront payment in the amount of $3.0 million and up to $5.3 million (or $8.8 million if we expand the Field as described above to include both the beta thalassemia and lysosomal storage disorders fields) in total regulatory milestone payments. Each regulatory milestone payment is payable once on an indication-by-indication basis. In addition, we have agreed to pay IDT a low single-digit royalty on the net sales of products, subject to reductions in specified circumstances, and a low double digit percentage payment for certain sublicense revenue, which is also subject to reduction in the event a sublicense includes other patent rights that are not patents licensed from IDT. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we have not achieved any of the regulatory milestones and have only paid the upfront license payment of $3.0 million.
The IDT License Agreement remains in effect on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the expiration of the royalty term for such product in such jurisdiction. We and IDT each have the right to terminate the IDT License Agreement for the other party’s material breach of its obligations under the IDT License Agreement, subject to specified rights to cure. Additionally, we may terminate the IDT License Agreement for any reason.
Our current in-licensed patent and patent applications from IDT, if the appropriate maintenance fees are paid, are expected to expire in 2037, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions.
The IDT License Agreement includes customary representations and warranties by each party as are customarily found in transactions of this nature, including as to the licensed intellectual property. The IDT License Agreement also provides for certain mutual indemnities for breaches of representations, warranties and covenants.
 Government Regulation
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we have been developing.
U.S. Biologics Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates biological products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), and the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), and their implementing regulations. Biological products are also subject to other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may result in delays to the conduct of a study, regulatory review and

approval or subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, license suspension or revocation, refusal to allow an applicant to proceed with clinical trials, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of untitled or warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations or penalties.
Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the Biologics License Application (BLA), process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before biological product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices (GLPs), regulations and standards; 
 •submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin; 
 •approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee representing each clinical site before the trial is commenced; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, Good Clinical Practices (GCPs), and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biological product candidate for its intended purpose; 
 •preparation of and submission to the FDA of a BLA, which includes not only the results of the clinical trials, but also, detailed information on the chemistry, manufacture and quality controls for the product candidate and proposed labeling; 
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements (cGMPs) and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity, and of selected clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA to assess compliance with the FDA’s GCPs; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable; and 
 •FDA review and approval, or licensure, of a BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States. 
 Preclinical and Clinical Development
Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, a sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol or protocols for preclinical studies and clinical trials. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product, chemistry, manufacturing and controls information, and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns, non-compliance, or other issues affecting the integrity of the trial. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial and, once begun, issues may arise that could cause the trial to be suspended or terminated.
In addition to the submission of an IND to the FDA before initiation of a clinical trial in the United States, certain human clinical trials involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules are subject to oversight at the local level as set forth in the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (NIH Guidelines). Specifically, under the NIH Guidelines, supervision of human gene transfer trials includes evaluation and assessment by an Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment, and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial. While the NIH Guidelines are not mandatory unless the research in question is being conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the

requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB or ethics committing at or servicing each site at which the clinical trial will be conducted must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy.
There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials and clinical study results to public registries. Sponsors of certain clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov.
Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1. The investigational product is typically administered to a small number of healthy volunteers. For gene therapies, the investigational product is typically initially introduced into patients with the target disease or condition. These trials are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with the investigational product, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. 
 •Phase 2. The investigational product is typically administered to a limited patient population to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. 
 •Phase 3. The investigational product is typically administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of a BLA. 
 When these phases overlap or are combined, the trials may be referred to as Phase 1/2 or Phase 2/3.
In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and further document clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the biologic, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
The FDA, the sponsor or the IRB or may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, if the trial is being overseen by a data safety monitoring board or committee, this group may recommend halting the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or on other grounds, such as interim data suggesting a lack of efficacy.

BLA Submission and Review
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product candidate for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product candidate’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies, which is adjusted on an annual basis. The FDA has sixty days from the applicant’s submission of a BLA to either issue a refusal to file letter or accept the BLA for filing, indicating that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or decide that the data is insufficient for approval, and may require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies before it accepts the filing.
Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process may be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product candidate is safe, pure and potent for its intended use, and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, and purity. The FDA may convene an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, to provide clinical insight on applications which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy and to review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured to determine whether the facilities comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCPs. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be manufactured, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification, which may include the potential requirement for additional clinical studies and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to preclinical studies and manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application or request a hearing. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for a particular indication(s) and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling or may condition the approval of the BLA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-market testing or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), to assure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to

further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. The fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new product candidates that meet certain criteria. Specifically, product candidates are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. A sponsor may request fast track designation of a product candidate concurrently with, or at any time after, submission of an IND, and the FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for such designation within 60 day of receipt of the sponsor’s request. The sponsor of a fast track product has opportunities for frequent interactions with the FDA review team during product development and, once a BLA is submitted, the product may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA.
A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive breakthrough therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. A sponsor may request that a product candidate be designated as a breakthrough therapy concurrently with, or at any time after, the submission of an IND, and the FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review.
As part of the 21st Century Cures Act, Congress amended the FDCA to create an expedited development program for RMATs, which include cell therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products. Gene therapies, including genetically modified cells that lead to a sustained effect on cells or tissues may meet the definition of a RMAT. The RMAT program is intended to facilitate efficient development and expedite review of RMATs, which are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. A sponsor may request that FDA designate a product candidate as a regenerative medicine advanced therapy concurrently with or at any time after submission of an IND. FDA has 60 calendar days to determine whether the drug meets the criteria, including whether there is preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. A new drug application or a BLA for a RMAT may be eligible for priority review or accelerated approval through (1) surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit or (2) reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites. Benefits of such designation include early interactions with FDA to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoint to be used to support accelerated approval. A RMAT that is granted accelerated approval and is subject to post-approval requirements may fulfill such requirements through the submission of clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real-world evidence, such as electronic health records; the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to its approval.
Any marketing application for a product candidate submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a fast track designation and/or breakthrough therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition compared to available therapies. For original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.
Additionally, product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product candidate generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 (FDORA), the FDA is now permitted to

require, as appropriate, that such trials be underway prior to approval or within a specific time period after the date of approval for a product granted accelerated approval. Sponsors are also required to send updates to the FDA every 180 days on the status of such studies, including progress toward enrollment targets, and the FDA must promptly post this information publicly. Under FDORA, the FDA has increased authority for expedited procedures to withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the sponsor fails to conduct such studies in a timely manner and send the necessary updates to the FDA, or if a confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. In addition, for products being considered for accelerated approval, the FDA generally requires, unless otherwise informed by the agency, that all advertising and promotional materials intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days of marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, RMAT designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a biological product candidate intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or 200,000 or more than individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a product for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that product. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process.
If a product candidate that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same product for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or if the holder of the orphan exclusivity cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different product for the same disease or condition, or the same product for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application fee.
A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 Pediatric Trials and Exclusivity
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDCA requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (PSP), within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Sponsors who conduct studies of their product candidate in children are eligible for pediatric exclusivity. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which attaches to the twelve-year exclusivity period for reference biologics, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
Rare Pediatric Disease Designation and Priority Review Vouchers
Under the FDCA, as amended, the FDA incentivizes the development of drugs and biologics that meet the definition of a “rare pediatric disease,” defined to mean a serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious of life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years and the disease affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or affects

200,000 or more in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making in the United States a drug for such disease or condition will be received from sales in the United States of such drug. The sponsor of a product candidate for a rare pediatric disease may be eligible for a voucher that can be used to obtain a priority review for a subsequent human drug or biologic application after the date of approval of the rare pediatric disease drug product, referred to as a priority review voucher (PRV). A sponsor may request rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA prior to the submission of its NDA or BLA. A rare pediatric disease designation does not guarantee that a sponsor will receive a PRV upon approval of its NDA or BLA. Moreover, a sponsor who chooses not to submit a rare pediatric disease designation request may nonetheless receive a PRV upon approval of their marketing application if they request such a voucher in their original marketing application and meet all of the eligibility criteria. If a PRV is received, it may be sold or transferred an unlimited number of times. Congress has extended the PRV program until September 30, 2024, with the potential for PRVs to be granted until September 30, 2026.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims or changes of the site of manufacture, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which the FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved BLA.
The FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. Biological product manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. BLA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These firms and, where applicable, their suppliers are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them. Manufacturers and other parties involved in the drug supply chain for prescription drug products must also comply with product tracking and tracing requirements and for notifying the FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products or products that are otherwise unfit for distribution in the United States. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 •fines, warning or untitled letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies; 
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals; 
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products; 
 •consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; 
 •mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information; 
 •the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or 
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biological products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s

FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict a manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
U.S. Patent Term Restoration
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our biological product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. In addition, a patent can only be extended once and only for a single product. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our patents, if and as applicable, to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity
The ACA includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. This amendment to the PHSA attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. This does not include a supplement for the biological product or a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device, or strength, unless that change is a modification to the structure of the biological product and such modification changes its safety, purity, or potency. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products.
Foreign Regulation
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety, and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Regulation and Procedures Governing Approval of Medicinal Products in Europe
Clinical Trial Approval
In the European Union, our future products also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls.
In April 2014, the EU adopted the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, (Regulation) which replaced the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC (Directive) on January 31, 2022. The transitory provisions of the Regulation provide that, by January 31, 2025, all ongoing clinical trials must have transitioned to the new Regulation.
 The new Regulation is directly applicable in all EU Member States (and so does not require national implementing legislation in each Member State), and aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical studies in the EU. The main characteristics of the new Regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point through the Clinical Trials Information System, (CTIS); a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts (Part I contains scientific and medicinal product documentation and Part II contains the national and patient-level documentation). Part I is assessed by a coordinated review by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Concerned Member States) of a draft report prepared by a Reference Member State. Part II is assessed separately by each Concerned Member State. Strict deadlines have also been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications.
 Marketing Authorization
To obtain a marketing authorization for a product in the European Union, an applicant must submit a marketing authorization application, either under the centralized procedure administered by the EMA or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in EU Member States (decentralized procedure, national procedure, or mutual recognition procedure).
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid throughout the EU, and in the additional Member States of the European Economic Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), or EEA. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products (gene therapy, somatic-cell therapy and tissue-engineered products) and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interests of public health.
Specifically, the grant of a marketing authorization in the EU for products based on genes, tissues or cells, such as gene therapy or somatic-cell therapy medicinal products, is governed in part by Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007 on advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs). Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007 lays down specific rules concerning the authorization, supervision, and pharmacovigilance of ATMPs. Manufacturers of ATMPs must demonstrate the quality, safety, and efficacy of their products to the EMA’s Committee for Advanced Therapies, which provides an opinion on the quality, safety and efficacy of each ATMP subject to marketing authorization application which is sent for final approval to the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). The CHMP recommendation is then sent to the European Commission, which adopts a decision on whether to grant a marketing authorization which is binding in all Member States. Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days from receipt of a valid application, excluding clock stops when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of a marketing authorization application considerably beyond 210 days. Accelerated assessment may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of major public health interest, particularly from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such a request, the timeframe of 210 days for assessment will be reduced to 150 days (excluding clock stops), but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.
Now that the UK (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) has left the EU, Great Britain will no longer be covered by centralized marketing authorizations (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, centralized marketing authorizations will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with an existing centralized marketing authorization were automatically converted to Great Britain marketing authorizations on January 1, 2021. For a period of three years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the UK medicines regulator, may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain marketing authorization. This is known as the EC Decision Reliance Procedure. On January 24, 2023, the MHRA announced that a new international recognition framework will be put in place from January 1, 2024, which will have regard to decisions on the approval of marketing authorizations made by the EMA and certain other regulators.
European Union Data and Marketing Exclusivity
In the EU, innovative medicinal products (including both small molecules and biological medicinal products) approved on the basis of a complete and independent data package, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator’s pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU, for a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar medicinal product can be placed on the EU market until the expiration of the market exclusivity period. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies. There is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EMA to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Even if a product is considered to be an innovative medicinal product so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company could nevertheless also market another version of the product if such company obtained a marketing authorization based on an application with a complete and independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
European Union Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
In the EU, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan designation in respect of a product if its sponsor can establish that: (1) the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (i) such condition affects no more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (ii) where it is unlikely that the marketing of the medicine, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would generate sufficient return in the EU to justify the necessary investment in its development; and (3)there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU or, if such a method exists, the product would be of a significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
In the EU, orphan designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers, and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following marketing approval for the orphan product. This period may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the orphan designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. During the period of market exclusivity, a marketing authorization may only be granted to a “similar medicinal product” for the same therapeutic indication if: (i) a second applicant can establish that its product, although similar to the authorized orphan product, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (ii) the marketing authorization holder for the authorized orphan product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (iii) the marketing authorization holder for the authorized orphan product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing authorization. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
Regulatory Requirements After a Marketing Authorization has been Obtained
If an authorization for a medicinal product in the EU is obtained, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. These include:
•Compliance with the EU’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules must be ensured. These rules can impose post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations. 
 •The manufacturing of authorized medicinal products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the EU with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the EU. 
 •The marketing and promotion of authorized drugs, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the EU. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is prohibited across the EU. 
 The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA.


Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
The UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020 and the EU and the UK have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement (the “TCA”), which was provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not provide for wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations. At present, Great Britain has implemented EU legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the EU regulatory framework continues to apply in Northern Ireland). The regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore aligns in many ways with current EU regulations, however it is possible that these regimes will diverge more significantly in future now that Great Britain’s regulatory system is independent from the EU and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical legislation. However, notwithstanding that there is no wholesale recognition of EU pharmaceutical legislation under the TCA, under the new framework mentioned above which will be put in place by the MHRA from January 1, 2024, the MHRA has stated that it will take into account decisions on the approval of marketing authorizations from the EMA (and certain other regulators) when considering an application for a Great Britain marketing authorization. On February 27, 2023, the UK government and the European Commission announced a political agreement in principle to replace the Northern Ireland Protocol with a new set of arrangements, known as the “Windsor Framework”. This new framework fundamentally changes the existing system under the Northern Ireland Protocol, including with respect to the regulation of medicinal products in the UK. In particular, the MHRA will be responsible for approving all medicinal products destined for the UK market (Great Britain and Northern Ireland) and the EMA will no longer have any role in approving medicinal products destined for Northern Ireland. A single UK-wide marketing authorization will be granted by the MHRA for all medicinal products to be sold in the UK, enabling products to be sold in a single pack and under a single authorization throughout the UK. Once the Windsor Framework is approved by the EU-UK Joint Committee, the UK Government and the EU will enact legislative measures to enact it into law.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we or our collaborators obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such drug products.
Our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, government authorities, private managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.
Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Such payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We or our collaborators may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Nonetheless, our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Moreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the drug product. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. Other European Union countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly

high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
The marketability of any product candidates for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
Healthcare providers, including physicians, and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates that we may develop for which we obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and customers may implicate broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, including certain laws and regulations applicable only if we have marketed products, include the following:
•the civil False Claims Act (FCA), prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties, for each false claim and treble the amount of the government’s damages. Manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The federal False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the federal False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery; 
 •the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. A violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can also form the basis for FCA liability; 
 •the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which, in addition to privacy protections applicable to healthcare providers and other entities, prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
 •HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH), and its implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes, among other things, certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, transmit, or obtain, protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity, and their covered subcontractors. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions; 
 •the FDCA, which among other things, strictly regulates drug marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing such products for off-label use and regulates the distribution of samples; 
 •federal laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain calculated product prices to the government or provide certain discounts or rebates to government authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement under government healthcare programs; 
 •federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act created under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ACA), and its implementing regulations, which requires manufacturers of certain drugs, devices, medical supplies, and biologics, among others, to track and disclose payments under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) and other transfers of value they make to U.S. physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other licensed health care practitioners and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and 


investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. This information is subsequently made publicly available in a searchable format on a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), website. Failure to disclose required information may result in civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians and/or other healthcare providers;
•federal government price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs;
 •federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; and
 •analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback, anti-bribery and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
 Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, track and report gifts, compensation and other remuneration made to physicians and other healthcare providers, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order, or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the European Union. The provision of benefits or advantages to also induce or reward improper performance generally is sometimes governed by the national anti-bribery laws of European Union Member States, and the Bribery Act 2010 in the United Kingdom. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. EU Directive 2001/83/EC, which is the EU Directive governing medicinal products for human use, further provides that, where medicinal products are being promoted to persons qualified to prescribe or supply them, no gifts, pecuniary advantages or benefits in kind may be supplied, offered or promised to such persons unless they are inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy. This provision has been transposed into the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and so remains applicable in the United Kingdom despite its departure from the EU.
Payments made to physicians in certain European Union Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his or her competent professional organization, and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual European Union Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct applicable in the European Union Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been and continue to be ongoing efforts to implement legislative and regulatory changes regarding the healthcare system. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products and services, implementing reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and applying new payment methodologies.
Within the United States, the federal government and individual states have aggressively pursued healthcare reform, as evidenced by the passing of the ACA and the ongoing efforts to modify or repeal that legislation. The ACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and contains a number of provisions that affect coverage and reimbursement of drug products and/or that could potentially reduce the demand for pharmaceutical products such as increasing drug rebates under state Medicaid programs for brand name prescription drugs and extending those rebates to Medicaid managed care and assessing a fee on manufacturers and importers of brand name prescription drugs reimbursed under certain government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Modifications have been implemented under the previous presidential administration and additional modifications or repeal may occur.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted, for example:
•The Budget Control Act of 2011 and subsequence legislation, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress that include aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which remain in effect through 2031. Due to the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, estimated budget deficit increases resulting from the 


American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, and subsequent legislation, Medicare payments to providers will be further reduced starting in 2025 absent further legislation.
 •The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. The Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA), also amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, by increasing the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and closing the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” 
 •On April 13, 2017, CMS published a final rule that gives states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.
 •On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. 
 •On May 23, 2019, CMS published a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020.
 Furthermore, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several congressional inquiries and proposed legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient assistance programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. President Biden has issued multiple executive orders that have sought to reduce prescription drug costs. In addition, in February 2023, HHS issued a proposal in response to an October 2022 executive order from President Biden that includes a proposed prescription drug pricing model that will test whether targeted Medicare payment adjustments will sufficiently incentivize manufacturers to complete confirmatory trials for drugs approved through FDA’s accelerated approval pathway. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA includes several provisions that may impact our business to varying degrees, including provisions that reduce the out-of-pocket spending cap for Medicare Part D beneficiaries from $7,050 to $2,000 starting in 2025, thereby effectively eliminating the coverage gap; impose new manufacturer financial liability on certain drugs under Medicare Part D, allow the U.S. government to negotiate Medicare Part B and Part D price caps for certain high-cost drugs and biologics without generic or biosimilar competition; require companies to pay rebates to Medicare for certain drug prices that increase faster than inflation; and delay until January 1, 2032 the implementation of the HSS rebate rule that would have limited the fees that pharmacy benefit managers can charge. Further, under the IRA, orphan drugs are exempted from the Medicare drug price negotiation program, but only if they have one rare disease designation and for which the only approved indication is for that disease or condition. If a product receives multiple rare disease designations or has multiple approved indications, it may not qualify for the orphan drug exemption. The effects of the IRA on our business and the healthcare industry in general is not yet known.
 At the state level, legislatures have also been increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 Employees and Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 120 full-time employees, including 34 with Ph.D. or M.D. degrees. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. In February 2023, we announced a reduction-in-force of approximately 50% in connection with a restructuring plan.
 We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended (JOBS Act). As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to:
•being permitted to present only two years of audited financial statements in this Form 10-K and only two years of related “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our periodic reports and registration statements, including this Form 10-K; 
 •not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (SOX); 
 •reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements, and registration statements; and 
 •exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 
 We may take advantage of these exemptions until such time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.23 billion or more; (ii) December 31, 2026; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these exemptions. We have taken advantage of reduced reporting requirements in this Form 10-K. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different from the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold stock. We have elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date we (1) are no longer an emerging growth company or (2) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.
