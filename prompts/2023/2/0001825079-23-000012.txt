Item 1. Business. 
Overview
We seek to fulfill the promise of additive manufacturing (“AM”), also referred to as three-dimensional printing (“3D printing”), to deliver breakthroughs in performance, cost, and lead time in the production of high-value metal parts.
We produce a fully integrated hardware and software solution based on our proprietary laser powder bed fusion (“L-PBF”) technology, which greatly reduces and often eliminates the need for support structures. Our technology enables the production of highly complex, mission-critical parts that existing AM solutions cannot produce without the need for redesign or additional assembly. 
Our Sapphire family of systems (collectively referred to as the “3D Printers”) give our customers who are in space, aviation, defense, automotive, energy and industrial markets the freedom to design and produce metal parts with complex internal features and geometries that had previously been considered impossible for AM. We believe our technology is years ahead of competitors. 
6 


Our technology is novel compared to other AM technologies based on its ability to deliver high-value metal parts that have complex internal channels, structures, and geometries. This affords a wide breadth of design freedom for creating new metal parts and it enables replication of existing parts without the need to redesign the part to be manufacturable with AM. Because of these features, we believe our technology and product capabilities are highly valued by our customers. Our customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") and contract manufacturers ("CMs") who look to AM to solve issues with traditional metal parts manufacturing technologies. Those traditional manufacturing technologies rely on processes, including casting, stamping and forging, that typically require high volumes to drive competitive costs and have long lead times for production. Our customers look to AM solutions to produce assemblies that are lighter, stronger, and more reliable than those manufactured with traditional technologies. Our customers also expect AM solutions to drive lower costs for low-volume parts and substantially shorter lead times. However, many of our customers have found that legacy AM technologies failed to produce the required designs for the high-value metal parts and assemblies that our customers wanted to produce with AM. As a result, other AM solutions often require that parts be redesigned so that they can be produced and frequently incur performance losses for high-value applications. 
In contrast, our technology can deliver complex high value metal parts with the design advantages, lower costs and faster lead times associated with AM, and generally avoids the need to redesign the parts. As a result, our customers have increasingly adopted our technology into their design and production processes. We believe our value is reflected in our sales patterns, as most customers purchase a single machine to validate our technology and purchase additional systems over time as they embed our technology in their product roadmap and manufacturing infrastructure. We consider this approach a “land and expand” strategy, oriented around a demonstration of our value proposition followed by increasing penetration with key customers.
We offer customers a fully integrated solution, which includes the following key components:
•Flow print preparation software conducts sophisticated analysis of the features of the metal part and specifies a production process that significantly reduces and often eliminates the need for support structures.
•Sapphire metal AM printers produce the part using our proprietary L-PBF technology. Our technology produces metal parts by fusing many thousands of very thin layers of metal powder with a precisely controlled laser beam in a sophisticated software defined sequence (or “recipe”) defined by our Flow software.
•Assure quality validation software validates the product made by Sapphire to confirm that it is made to the specifications required by the original design.
Legacy AM technologies often rely on internal supports to prevent deformation of the metal part during the 3D printing process. These supports inhibit the production of parts with complex internal geometries, which are often required in high-performance applications, because there is limited or no access to remove them after production. Our technological advances enable our Sapphire family of systems to print metal parts that significantly reduce and often eliminates the need for internal supports, which enables our customers to produce designs that would otherwise be infeasible to make with AM.
We sell our fully integrated hardware and software AM solutions through two types of transaction models: a 3D Printer sale transaction and a recurring payment transaction. Support services are included with a 3D Printer sale transaction and a recurring payment transaction. A subsequent Extended Support Agreement is available for renewal after the initial contract period based on the then-fair value of the service, which is paid for separately. 
3D Printer sale transactions fall into two categories: a structured fixed purchase price for the system or a sale and utilization (variable consideration) fee model. In the sale and utilization fee model, customers pay an upfront amount that is less than the full purchase price to purchase the system. This purchase price is supplemented by an hourly usage fee for each hour of system utilization over the life of the system. We make certain estimates in calculating the variable consideration, including amount of hours, the estimated life of the equipment and the 
7 


discount rate. Although estimates may be made on a contract-by-contract basis, whenever possible, we use all available information including historical customer usage and collection patterns to estimate variable consideration. Management reassesses the estimated variable consideration quarterly.
Recurring payment transactions are our leased 3D printer transactions. Under the leased 3D printer transaction, the customer typically pays an amount for a lease which entitles the customer to a base number of hours of usage. For usage above that level, the customer typically pays an hourly usage fee. Most of our leases have a 12-month term, though in certain cases the lease term is longer. The variable payments are recognized when the event determining the amount of variable consideration to be paid occurs. 
We shipped our first Sapphire XC 1MZ system at the end of 2022, one year after the Sapphire XC launch at the end of 2021, and we shipped our first Sapphire system at the end of 2018. The Sapphire XC 1MZ system has the same functionality of the Sapphire XC with a 1000 millimeter (one meter) height build volume of the Sapphire XC 1MZ system compared to the 550 millimeter height build volume of the Sapphire XC system. The Sapphire XC has capacity to make parts that are 400% larger and reduce production costs per part by approximately 65% to 80% when compared to the original Sapphire system. All of our Sapphire systems are manufactured in our 80,000+ square foot manufacturing facility in Fremont, California. 
Strategy for Growth 
The key elements for our growth strategy include the following: 
Focus on uncontested segments of the market 
We focus our sales efforts on customers with a need for parts which our proprietary L-PBF technology can produce but which cannot be produced by competitors’ AM technology. These include high-performance metal parts with complex internal geometries, including critical components within jet engines, fuel delivery systems and heat exchangers. These parts are fundamentally out of reach for other AM suppliers serving the high-value metal parts segment because their production process requires internal supports for complex internal geometries, which cannot be removed. Likewise, the processes required by traditional metal manufacturing processes (for example, welding of multiple parts into the desired assembly) often result in parts with lower performance, higher cost and/or longer lead times than the parts which our solution can produce. We generally do not compete in the segment of the AM market composed of applications which can be served by the multiple existing competitors in metal AM. Our primary focus is on those applications where demand for our solution is expected to be the strongest, thus supporting our long-term margins. 
Increasing customer penetration
We adopt a two-step approach to customer relationships, whereby we first aim to validate our technology with customers before working to more fully integrate our technology into customers’ designs and/or production processes. Upon building a strong customer relationship, our sales personnel and engineers collaborate with their customer counterparts to identify how our technology can add the greatest value to the customer’s ultimate product. We have found that this helps customers to best understand the potential for the wide breadth of design freedom that our products can deliver, which often leads to customers fully integrating our technology into their processes and making multiple follow-up purchases. This results in economies of scale, as fewer sales and engineering personnel are able to serve a larger number of machines that are concentrated with a smaller number of customers. In addition, by integrating our technology into customer designs, we effectively expand the uncontested market which we believe we are optimally suited to serve. 
Accelerate global acquisition of new customers 
We plan to increase the number of customer relationships we have globally in the coming years both organically and through distribution partnerships. In recent years, we have demonstrated that our technology can bring tremendous value across a number of use cases in the space, aviation and defense, automotive, energy and 
8 


industrial segments. We plan to leverage the success from these deployments into sales to a number of new customers by further ramping our sales force in the coming years to drive new customer acquisition. In addition to our U.S., Australian and European sales organization, we have also established relationships with distribution partners in the Asia-Pacific region (Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corporation, and Avaco) and in the U.S. (GoEngineer, and HarTech Group) and sales agents in the Middle East to provide greater leverage to our sales team and enable expansion into new markets.
Rapidly scale to meet customer demand 
We plan to scale our business quickly to meet the significant increase in demand that we have seen from our customers by increasing the number of sales representatives and engineers to serve those customers, as well as our production capacity. Our manufacturing operations are limited to the final assembly and test of the system. Components and sub-assemblies are sourced from suppliers. As a result, we have the ability to scale our manufacturing operations with relatively limited capital investment because we only require additional assembly and warehouse space to increase our manufacturing capacity. Further, because our business model is capital efficient, we are able to adapt to shifts in customer demand and calibrate our growth plans to ensure that we maintain the appropriate production capacity at all times. 
Extend competitive advantage with new products and continued R&D 
We plan to accelerate our research and development ("R&D") efforts in the future to further extend our technological advantage relative to our competitors. We have spent approximately $87 million over the past three years in R&D. The latest iteration of our product is our Sapphire XC 1MZ system, which launched at the end of 2022. The Sapphire XC 1MZ system has the same functionality of the Sapphire XC with a 1000 millimeter (one meter) height build volume of the Sapphire XC 1MZ system compared to the 550 millimeter height build volume of the Sapphire XC system. We believe this will increase considerably the range of applications where our manufacturing technology will be competitive with traditional metal manufacturing techniques, thereby substantially expanding our addressable market. CONTEXT expects that the market forecast for laser powder bed fusion will grow greater than 30% from 2020 to 2026.
Our Competitive Strengths 
Disruptive AM platform with the unique ability to produce complex designs 
In contrast to other L-PBF technologies, our proprietary L-PBF technology is capable of producing metal parts with complex internal geometries. Manufacturers of high-performance products have looked to AM to improve performance, reduce costs and shorten lead times relative to traditional metal parts manufacturers; however, other AM solutions have been historically limited because they must use internal supports to enable production of the part. Our technology delivers on the promise of AM, allowing customers a wide breadth of freedom to design products with consistently optimal performance characteristics. In addition to greater design freedom, our technology allows customers to consolidate assemblies of multiple metal parts into a single part that delivers a consistently stronger, lighter, better performing part at a lower cost than possible through traditional metal manufacturing techniques, while consistently maintaining the applicable density requirement for industrial metal portions of metallic 3D objects. Finally, our solutions enable the production of high-value, low-volume spare parts on demand, which may result in meaningful reductions to requirements for inventory. These factors create an uncontested segment in the market with customers we are ideally positioned to serve. 
Existing relationships with blue chip customers across our target end markets 
We have built relationships with blue chip customers across all of our target industries, including space, aviation and defense, automotive, energy and other industrial applications. In addition to our direct OEM customer relationships, we also continue to expand our relationships with our indirect customers who specify our 3D printers for the manufacture of components by CMs that use our 3D printers. While these customers provide no direct revenue, they drive parts volume demand for our CMs and therefore, indirectly, our 3D printer demand. We have 
9 


built these relationships by demonstrating the value that our differentiated technology can achieve and integrating our solutions into their operations, resulting in repeat sales to multiple customers within a short span of time. Our success in partnering with existing customers has also validated our differentiated technology for other potential customers. We believe that our successes with these efforts provide meaningful proof of our proprietary technology and will enable our strategy of rapid customer acquisition in the coming years. 
Fully Integrated turnkey solution that can be easily integrated into customer operations 
Our fully integrated metal AM solution can be integrated into customer operations with relative ease, facilitating adoption with new customers, as well as the installation of additional systems with existing customers. We typically dedicate one engineer for several weeks around the time of the installation to educate customers as to how to best use our systems and to identify how our technology can most effectively add value to customer processes. After this point, our customers become largely self-supported, requiring only occasional support from our sales and engineering staff. This enables us to effectively reallocate our engineers and salesforce to continue to engage with new potential customers, supporting our efforts to scale our operations rapidly. 
Deep moat of intellectual property protections 
We have a strong, multi-layered portfolio protecting our intellectual property (“IP”) rights, which reinforces our competitive advantage. As of December 31, 2022, we own 58 issued patents of which 40 are issued U.S. patents, and 18 are issued foreign patents. We also have 22 publicly pending patent applications of which seven are pending U.S. patent applications, 13 are pending foreign patent applications, and two are pending Patent Cooperation Treaty ("PCT") patent applications. Our issued patents will expire at different times in the future, with the earliest expiring in 2035 and the latest expiring in 2047. Our currently pending patent applications will generally remain in effect for 20 years from the date of filing of the initial patent application of each. Our six trademark types worldwide include four registered U.S. trademarks, 34 registered foreign trademarks, two pending U.S. trademark applications, and 18 pending foreign trademark applications. We also have one U.S. registered copyright.
Capital efficient business model 
We have an asset-light business model, which will allow us to scale our operations to meet expected customer demand. Our own manufacturing operations are primarily limited to final assembly, testing and shipment. Further, we believe our units are higher value and lower volume relative to other AM solutions providers, which reduces the burden on our supply chain as we expand. Our final assembly process does not require expensive clean rooms but instead occurs within an assembly facility. We believe that this will enable us to rapidly scale our business model to meet customer demand, without the risks associated with other manufacturing models that require heavy capital expenditures to increase production capacity. 
Experienced management team 
Our management team has decades of relevant experience across their respective industries, including materials engineering, technological development, operations, sales, business development and corporate finance. Our management team is led by our Chief Executive Officer, Benny Buller, who has had a highly successful career as an engineer, culminating in the highest Israeli Presidential award for one of the projects he led in the Israeli intelligence community, before taking leadership positions in cutting-edge American technology firms, including in First Solar and Applied Materials. Our Chief Financial Officer, Bill McCombe, has extensive experience as a senior financial officer in public and private technology hardware companies and as a senior investment banker overseeing strategic transactions. Further, we added experienced independent board members during 2021 and 2022 to support our management team. 
Our Product Platforms 
10 


Since our founding in 2014, we have focused development on our primary solution, marketed as Sapphire. Sapphire is a fully integrated solution including the Flow design software and Assure quality control software. At the end of 2022, we launched our Sapphire XC 1MZ system, and at the end of 2021, we launched our Sapphire XC system, both of which enable production of larger parts at a lower cost. 
Our software is fully integrated into the design, production and quality control platform with our Sapphire family of systems. We maintain legal title of our software systems for products sold under both our 3D printer sale transactions and recurring payment transactions. 
Flow 
Flow software powers the whole family of Sapphire AM printers. Our systems rely on a similar manufacturing process for all of our printer solutions. Flow is a highly advanced and proprietary software platform, which scans part designs for unique geometrical features. It uses advanced computational algorithms to prescribe specific manufacturing “recipes” and processes specific to the Sapphire production systems, e.g., to ensure that the 3D object is produced with the required specifications. 
Sapphire, Sapphire 1MZ, Sapphire XC and Sapphire XC 1MZ
The Sapphire printer system is our first generation production machine. Sapphire uses L-PBF technology and supports a build module of 315 millimeter diameter by 400 millimeter tall, and volume of up to 31 liters. 
Sapphire XC is our second generation of printers and started shipping at the end of 2021. The acronym XC stands for “extra capacity” and as compared to Sapphire, has a larger build module of 600 millimeter diameter by 550 millimeter tall, and volume of up to 155 liters. Sapphire XC is based on the same fundamental design of our original Sapphire 3D printers. The Sapphire XC printer system is designed with the intent that all recipes and parts 
11 


designed for the original Sapphire printers are fully compatible with the Sapphire XC printer systems, as the new system line is designed to carry over processes and metrologies.
The Sapphire 1MZ and Sapphire XC 1MZ printer systems are our newest addition to our Sapphire family of printers line. The Sapphire 1MZ and Sapphire XC 1MZ systems have the same functionality as the Sapphire and Sapphire XC, respectively. However, the 1MZ printers are larger having a 1000 millimeter (one meter) height build module as compared to the 400 millimeter and 550 millimeter height build module for Sapphire and Sapphire XC, respectively. 
Our machines have the ability to make parts with thousands of composite structures made from various metals including titanium, nickel-alloys, nickel super alloys, copper, steel and steel alloys. In principle, any metal that is cold-weldable is able to be used as a base layer in our machines. We currently have recipes to print from ten different metals (e.g., alloys) and add recipes for additional metals based on customer demand. Our team of materials and metallurgy experts qualify new materials on our Sapphire family of printers based on customer requirements and feedback. We are currently working on new materials, such various types of stainless steel, and additional aluminum and copper alloys.
Assure 
Assure is an advanced quality control software platform that includes process metrologies to ensure repeatable, consistent part quality. The platform works with a myriad of complex sensors, which allow prompt control modulation of the laser systems of the Sapphire printer line, to calibrate production outcomes within prescribed tolerances. 
Intelligent Fusion
Intelligent Fusion is the underlying manufacturing process that binds and facilitates all aspects of the Velo3D fully integrated solution, which includes our print preparation software (Flow), advanced metal 3D printers (Sapphire line), and quality assurance software (Assure).
Intelligent Fusion unifies and manages all of the above, including the information flow, sensor data from approximately 1,000 sensors, and the advanced printing technology for precision control of the entire print.
Customers 
Our customers range from small- and medium-sized enterprises to Fortune 500 companies in the space, aviation, defense, automotive, energy and industrial markets. Our largest customer, Space Exploration Technologies Corp. ("SpaceX"), accounted for 28.4% and 27.8% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our customers include both OEMs, as well as CMs who provide service and parts on behalf of OEMs. Our 3D printer sales occur under purchase orders that are governed by our terms and conditions of sale. Our terms and conditions with our largest customer are consistent with all other customers and permit the customers to terminate our services at any time (subject to notice and certain other provisions). 
We only sell to production customers. Our machines are not resalable without consent and software licenses are not transferable to certain geographic markets to protect our IP.

Research and Development 
The high-value metal parts and AM segments are undergoing technological advancements across hardware, software and materials. We continue to dedicate meaningful resources into our ongoing R&D programs to extend our technological leadership. Specifically, our R&D team is focused on continuing advances in technology that include, but are not limited to: 
•enhancements of the Sapphire family of systems, such as our 1MZ systems; 
•improvement of reliability and productivity of the Sapphire family of systems; 
•expansion of functionality of Flow software; 
•qualifying new materials;
•additional quality control features in Assure; and 
•addition of recipes for new and for qualified metal alloys. 
We invest a significant amount of our resources in R&D because we believe that superior technology is a key to maintaining a leading market position. In the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our R&D expenses were approximately $46.3 million and $27.0 million. 
Sales and Marketing 
We sell our AM solutions directly, as well as through a network of multiple distribution partners. Together, these relationships span much of the world, including the United States, the EU, Australia, Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia. For new customers, our success reflects our strategy of making an initial sale to customers for technology validation before increasing penetration through sales of additional units. 
Our marketing strategy is oriented around building deep and lasting relationships with leading global manufacturers. We seek to compete by maximizing the value we create for our customers. To that end, our engineers engage with customers to identify the specific parts and processes where our solutions can add the most immediate value. At the time of the installation, our engineers will typically engage with customers for several weeks to educate them on the system, after which point customers are typically able to operate the system without our direct engagement. 
Our sales team remains engaged with customers after initial validation of our technology with a goal of integrating our technology into other customer processes. Thus far, we believe this strategy has proven successful.
In recent years, we have successfully demonstrated the utility of our technology across multiple target markets, including the highest performance application in the space, aviation and defense, automotive, energy and industrial end markets. We believe these successful deployments have seeded the market and will enable increased acquisition of new customers in those segments. 
We rely on our own sales team, as well as multiple distribution partners, including Taiyo Nippon Sanso (Japan), Avaco (South Korea), and GoEngineer and HarTech Group (North America). These relationships have helped to extend our reach into overseas markets and essentially function as extensions of our sales team. We have entered into partnership agreements with each of our distribution partners, which grant the distribution partner the right to market our products in a specified territory on either an exclusive or nonexclusive basis, depending on the distribution partner; however, all sales contracts for our products are entered into between us and our customers. Certain of these distribution partners also provide maintenance services to customers in their specified territories. Going forward, we plan to expand our direct sales force and will consider establishing additional distribution partnerships as we continue to implement our strategy with new customers.

Our European Headquarters at the Augsburg Innovation Park, located in Augsburg, Germany, includes teams of sales, application engineering and field service engineering personnel, similar to the U.S. office. 
Manufacturing and Suppliers 
We design, assemble, test and ship all of our products and rely on outside manufacturers for component and select subsystems. Production of our systems requires approximately 8 to 15 weeks depending on the Sapphire product within our family of systems. We employ several third-party vendors to supply our core hardware subsystems and components. Following receipt of these subsystems and components, we assemble and calibrate the system. We then conduct a series of process tests culminating in a final factory acceptance test. We have internal teams focused on technology development, engineering and manufacturing. The teams coordinate the design, construction, assembly, testing and shipment of our products. 
We currently rely on numerous external suppliers, which we believe have ample capacity to increase supply of our critical components. For the majority of these suppliers, we believe we can readily source components from competing suppliers on short notice. For several critical subsystems, we have developed multiple suppliers to ensure surety of supply. 
We manage our inventory based on sales and production forecasts and anticipated lead times for sourcing components and assembly. 
Intellectual Property 
Our leadership in the high-value metal parts AM segment depends largely on our differentiated technology, which we seek to protect through a multi-layered IP approach. Our IP protection enables us to prevent organizations and individuals from selling or using our systems, apparatuses, devices, and software, practicing our methods, or trading in our produced parts (e.g., 3D objects), as these are all protected by various forms of IP protection including by our patents granted in various jurisdictions and by our trade secrets.
We attempt to protect our IP rights, in various jurisdictions (e.g., United States and abroad), through a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, as well as nondisclosure and invention assignment agreements with our consultants and employees, and nondisclosure agreements with our contractors, vendors and other business partners. 
We pursue patent protection when we believe it is possible and consistent with our overall strategy for safeguarding IP. 
Our patent profile is a broad portfolio across our systems, apparatuses, devices, methods (e.g., of production), software, and composition of matter (e.g., 3D objects). Metal parts produced using our system technology have a signature that is readily recognizable and traceable. 
We own 58 issued patents of which 40 are issued U.S. patents, and 18 are issued foreign patents. We also have 22 publicly pending patent applications of which seven are pending U.S. patent applications, 13 are pending foreign patent applications, and two are pending PCT) patent applications. Our issued patents will expire at different times in the future, with the earliest expiring in 2035 and the latest expiring in 2047. Our currently pending patent applications will generally remain in effect for 20 years from the date of filing of the initial patent application of each. Our six trademark types worldwide include four registered U.S. trademarks, 34 registered foreign trademarks, two pending U.S. trademark applications, and 18 pending foreign trademark applications. We also have one U.S. registered copyright.

Human Capital Resources 
We have a strong team of employees who contribute to our success. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had 294 and 193, respectively, full-time employees, the majority of them based at our headquarters in Campbell, California and our manufacturing facility in Fremont, California. We rely on consultants and outside contractors in roles and responsibilities that include engineering, operations and finance. 
To date, we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relationship with our employees to be in good standing. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union. 
We have initiated leadership training in the first quarter of 2023 across the Company to strengthen our Company’s culture it how we manage relationships with employees, suppliers, customers and the communities in which we operate. The training is our first step to building a framework and strategy in educating our Company and employees on awareness of the importance of environmental, social and governance issues, such as diversity and inclusion, employee friendly policies, employee retention rates, sustainability, climate-risks, and other important topics that will benefit our Company, employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders and investors. 
Our board of directors oversees matters relating to managing our human capital resources. Our human capital resources objectives include identifying, recruiting, retaining, training, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees, as well as emphasizing work place safety. We review our compensation and benefit policies regularly through industry benchmarks and, we believe we offer competitive compensation and benefits packages, the principal purposes of which are to attract, retain and motivate our employees. 
Competition 
We compete with other suppliers of 3D printers, materials and software, as well as with suppliers of traditional metal manufacturing solutions. We compete with these suppliers, as well as channel partners, for customers, and for certain of our products. We also compete with businesses and service bureaus that use such equipment to produce models, prototypes, molds and end-user parts. Development of new technologies or techniques not encompassed by the patents that we own may result in additional future competition. 
Our competitors operate both globally and regionally, and many of them have well-recognized brands and product lines. Additionally, certain of our competitors are well established and may have greater financial resources than us. 
We believe principal competitive factors include technology capabilities, materials, process and application know-how, total cost of operation of solution, product reliability and the ability to provide a full range of products and services to meet customer needs. We believe that our future success depends on our ability to provide high-quality solutions, introduce new products and services to meet evolving customer needs, market opportunities, and extend our technologies to new applications. Accordingly, our ongoing R&D programs are intended to enable us to continue technology advancement and develop innovative new solutions for the marketplace.

Based on information currently available to us, we do not expect environmental costs and contingencies to have a material adverse effect on our operations. The operation of our facility, however, entails risks in these areas. Significant expenditures could be required in the future to comply with environmental or health and safety laws, regulations or other requirements. Certain of these compliance requirements are imposed by our customers, who at times require us to be registered with U.S. health or safety regulatory agencies, whether on the federal or state level. 
Under environmental laws and regulations, we are required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain operations. 
In the European marketplace, among others, electrical and electronic equipment is required to comply with the Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment of the EU, which aims to prevent waste by encouraging reuse and recycling, and the EU Directive on Restriction of Use of Certain Hazardous Substances, which restricts the use of various hazardous substances in electrical and electronic products. Our products and certain components of such products “put on the market” in the EU (whether or not manufactured in the EU) are subject to these directives. Additionally, we are required to comply with certain laws, regulations and directives governing chemicals, including the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act, Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”), the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (“RoHS”) and Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation (“CLP”) in the EU.
