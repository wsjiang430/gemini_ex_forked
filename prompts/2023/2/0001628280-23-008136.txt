ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Background
Ascend Wellness Holdings, Inc. (“AWH,” “Ascend,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) is a vertically integrated multi-state cannabis operator focused on operating in adult-use or near-term adult-use states in primarily limited license markets. Ascend’s core business is the cultivation, manufacturing, and distribution of cannabis consumer packaged goods, which are sold through company-owned retail stores and to third-party licensed retail cannabis stores. The Company is a reporting issuer in the United States and in each of the provinces and territories of Canada. The Company’s shares of Class A common stock are listed in Canada on the Canadian Securities Exchange (“CSE”) under the symbol “AAWH.U.” and in the United States on the OTCQX Best Market (the “OTCQX”) under the symbol “AAWH.” Ascend is an emerging growth company under federal securities laws and as such Ascend is able to elect to follow scaled disclosure requirements for this filing. 
The Company was founded in 2018 with initial operations in Illinois and has since expanded its operational footprint, primarily through acquisitions, and now has operations or financial interests in six U.S. geographic markets: Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Subsequent to year-end, the Company entered definitive agreement to acquire assets which would expand its footprint to its seventh state, Maryland. As of December 31, 2022, Ascend had 24 open dispensaries, 20 of which are in states which have passed legislation permitting recreational cannabis. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, the Company opened dispensaries in New Bedford, Massachusetts and Grand Rapids, Michigan. The Company has fully-financed expansion plans to achieve 39 total open dispensaries by mid-2024 through licenses it already owns or licenses which it is under definitive agreement to acquire. This includes 4 dispensaries in Maryland that the Company expects to acquire pursuant to a definitive agreement that was signed in January 2023 and is pending regulatory approval. Ascend operates cultivation facilities in six states with approximately 245,000 square feet of canopy with an estimated total annual production capacity of approximately 122,000 pounds.
Ascend believes in bettering lives through cannabis. The Company’s mission is to improve the lives of its employees, patients, customers and the communities they serve through the use of the cannabis plant. As of March 1, 2023, AWH employed approximately 2,000 people across the cultivation, processing, retail, and corporate functions. 
The following organizational chart describes our current organizational structure. See Exhibit 21.1 to this filing for a list of AWH’s subsidiaries. All lines represent 100% ownership of outstanding securities of the applicable subsidiary unless otherwise noted. In part, the complexity of the organization structure is due to state licensing requirements that mandate that the Company maintain the corporate identity of the operating license holders. 
Legend for state of incorporation:
AWH’s registered office is located at 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, DE 19801. The Company’s headquarters are located at 1411 Broadway, 16th Floor, New York, NY 10018.
History of the Company
Founding and Incorporation
The Company was originally formed on May 15, 2018 as Ascend Group Partners, LLC, and changed its name to “Ascend Wellness Holdings, LLC” on September 10, 2018. On April 22, 2021, Ascend Wellness Holdings, LLC converted into a Delaware corporation and changed its name to “Ascend Wellness Holdings, Inc.” and effected a 2-for-1 reverse stock split, which is retrospectively presented for all periods in this filing and referred to as the “Conversion.” As a result of the Conversion, the members of Ascend Wellness Holdings, LLC became holders of shares of stock of Ascend Wellness Holdings, Inc. 
Following the Conversion, the Company has authorized 750,000,000 shares of Class A common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share, 100,000 shares of Class B common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. The rights of the holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical, except for voting and conversion rights. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 1,000 votes per share and is convertible at any time into one share of Class A common stock at the option of the holder. 
Initial Public Offering 
On May 4, 2021, the Company completed an Initial Public Offering (“IPO”) of its Class A common stock, in which it issued and sold 10.0 million shares of Class A common stock at a price of $8.00 per share. On May 7, 2021, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full and we issued and sold an additional 1.5 million shares of Class A common stock. AWH received total net proceeds of approximately $86.1 million after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and certain other direct offering expenses paid by the Company. In connection with the IPO, the historical common units, Series Seed Preferred Units, Series Seed+ Preferred Units, and Real Estate Preferred Units then-outstanding automatically converted into a total of 113.3 million shares of Class A common stock and 65 thousand historical common units were allocated as shares of Class B common stock. Additionally, 3.4 million shares of Class A common stock were issued for a beneficial conversion feature associated with the conversion of certain historical preferred units and the Company’s convertible notes, plus accrued interest, converted into 37.4 million shares of Class A common stock. The Company’s shares of Class A common stock are listed on the CSE under the ticker symbol “AAWH.U” and are quoted on the OTCQX Best Market under the symbol “AAWH.” 
Outstanding Securities
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 200.9 million fully diluted shares outstanding, including approximately 188.0 million shares of Class A common stock, approximately 0.1 million shares of Class B common stock, and approximately 7.1 million total unvested restricted stock awards and restricted stock units. Additionally, there are approximately 5.7 million warrants outstanding, none of which are in the money based on the closing stock price of the shares of Class A common stock on the CSE on December 31, 2022 of $1.15 per share.
Financing History
Historically, Ascend used private financing as a source of liquidity for its short-term working capital needs and general corporate purposes. In August 2021, the Company entered into a new credit facility, which provides for a $210.0 million term loan (the “Term Loan”) that bears interest at a rate of 9.5% per annum, due quarterly. Proceeds from the Term Loan were used, in part, to prepay approximately $75.6 million of existing debt and the remainder will be used to finance future growth initiatives and acquisitions. During the second quarter of 2022, the Company borrowed an additional $65.0 million of term loans under the expansion feature of the credit facility for total borrowings of $275.0 million.
To date, the Company has funded many of its expansion projects via sale leaseback transactions. The significant sale leaseback financings are further described below:
•In August 2018, AWH acquired the real property where its Athol, Massachusetts cultivation facility is located. In April 2020, AWH executed a sale leaseback agreement with Innovative Industrial Properties, Inc. (“IIP”) with a sale price of $26.8 million and a tenant improvement allowance (“TIA”) of $22.2 million to fund the expansion of the cultivation facility.
•In December 2018, AWH acquired the real property where its Barry, Illinois cultivation facility is located and simultaneously executed a sale leaseback agreement with IIP with a sale price of $19.0 million and an in initial TIA of $6.0 million. The TIA has subsequently increased to $52.0 million as we have expanded the cultivation facility, including the addition of a greenhouse.
•In June 2019, AWH acquired the real property where its Lansing, Michigan cultivation facility is located. In July 2019, AWH executed a sale leaseback agreement with IIP with a sale price of $4.8 million and a TIA of $15.0 million to fund the expansion of the facility.
•In January 2022, AWH acquired the real property where the Franklin, New Jersey cultivation facility is located. In February 2022, AWH executed a sale leaseback agreement with IIP with a sale price of $35.4 million and a TIA of $4.6 million to fund the expansion of the facility. 
•In June 2022, the Company sold and subsequently leased back two of its capital assets in Pennsylvania for total proceeds of $3.8 million, excluding transaction costs. Each of the lease agreements provide for a capital expenditure allowance of up to $3.0 million. 
On November 22, 2022, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-3 (the “Registration Statement”) containing a base shelf prospectus with the SEC (the “Shelf Prospectus”), which Registration Statement became effective on December 22, 2022. A corresponding base shelf prospectus (the “Canadian Prospectus”) was filed with, and receipted by, the securities regulatory authorities in each of the provinces and territories Canada 
under the U.S.-Canada multijurisdictional disclosure system (MJDS). The Registration Statement and Canadian Prospectus qualify the distribution from treasury of up to an aggregate amount of $100 million worth of shares of Class A common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities, subscription rights and/or units of the Company (“Securities”) for a period of three years. The terms of any Securities to be offered under the base prospectus will be specified in a prospectus supplement, which will be filed with the applicable U.S. and Canadian securities regulatory authorities in connection with any such offering. To date, no prospectus supplement has been filed. The Shelf Prospectus and the Canadian Prospectus were filed to provide maximum flexibility to pursue strategic initiatives.
Acquisitions
The Company has grown rapidly by strategically acquiring licenses and operations. Ascend’s core acquisition philosophy has been to acquire assets in: marquee locations, limited-license states, and recreational or near-recreational markets. Growth via acquisition has allowed Ascend to strategically select and to operate primarily in highly competitive market dynamics. The Company’s key transactions are detailed in the table below.

Description of the Business
Overview of the Company
Ascend is a vertically integrated multi-state cannabis operator focused on adult-use or near-term adult-use cannabis states in limited license markets. The core business is the cultivation, manufacturing, and distribution of cannabis consumer packaged goods, which Ascend sells through company-owned retail stores and to third-party licensed retail cannabis stores. Ascend believes in bettering lives through cannabis. The mission is to improve the lives of its employees, patients, customers and the communities we serve through the use of the cannabis plant. 
The consumer products portfolio is generated primarily from plant material that the Company grows and processes. As of December 31, 2022, AWH produces consumer-packaged goods in six manufacturing facilities with 245,000 square feet of cumulative canopy and total capacity of 122,500 pounds annually. As of December 31, 2022, the product portfolio consists of 497 SKUs, across a range of cannabis product categories, including flower, pre-rolls, concentrates, vapes, edibles, and other cannabis-related products. All of the expansion plans are subject to capital allocation decisions, the evolving regulatory environment and the COVID-19 pandemic. See “Forward-Looking Statements.”
Product Offering
Ascend produces and distributes cannabis products for its wholesale partners and AWH owned retail stores. Ascend’s goal is to provide wholesale partners and retail customers with consistent access to quality cannabis products while maintaining a variety of form-factors and SKUs. Ascend currently produces its full product set with multiple form factors in Illinois where it has a lab and kitchen. Ascend is in the process of building labs and kitchens at many of its other cultivation facilities so it can produce other form factors such as edibles, in addition to flower and pre-rolls, in all of the states in which it operates. Ascend’s in-house brands offer a variety of options to satisfy every potential customer’s budget and preference. Ascend’s approach to branding is to have brands that fit the “good”, “better”, and “best” consumer categories. The in-house brands include: SimplyHerb, Ozone, and Ozone Reserve. SimplyHerb is the “good” brand and the most price accessible product with SKUs targeted for the price conscious, value-driven buyer. SimplyHerb is currently produced and sold in Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, and New Jersey. Ozone is the “better” brand aimed at providing quality products to the seasoned connoisseur as well as the canna-curious. Ozone is currently produced and sold in Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, and Ohio. Ozone Reserve is the “best” offering with premier products including exotic flower, refined concentrates, purified oils, as well as resins and distillates. Ozone Reserve is currently produced and sold in Illinois, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. 
In addition to producing its own brands, AWH also partners with multiple premiere brands for which it cultivates and sells products targeted to different demographics. Among our partners are Miss Grass, Lowell Farms, Flower by Edie Parker, 1906, and AiroPro. This model allows AWH to target customer demographics that complement its base-markets and leverage brand recognition of our partners, while crafting and selling their tried-and-true products. For example:
•Miss Grass offers an assortment of pre-roll products that skew to the female demographic. Their “high-times,” “all times,” “good times,” and “half times” mini pre-roll have been well received at AWH retail stores and amongst its wholesale offering. 
•Lowell Smokes, by Lowell Farms, allows AWH to leverage the Lowell Farms brand amongst the male demographic seeking premium pre-rolls. 
•Edie Parker is a Women-led fashion and lifestyle company that launched a cannabis brand, “Flower by Edie Parker.” The Flower by Edie Parker line provides AWH with a product aimed to attract the female consumer. 
•1906 is a brand targeted to consumers looking for premier edible experiences. 1906 gives AWH the ability to provide a competitive edible offering. 
•AiroPro is dedicated to perfecting the union between technology and personal vaporizers, with advanced Airo Pro vapor systems designed to create the ideal vaping experience.
While the Company aims to have a plethora of brand offerings, its goal is to have 50% of products sold in Ascend retail dispensaries being in-house or partner branded products. With this strategy, AWH expects to benefit from vertical margins, while maintaining an offering with options and variety for its retail consumers. No customer represented more than 10% of the Company’s net revenue during 2022, 2021, or 2020.
Strategy
AWH is committed to running the business aligned with its core strategic principles. These include a focus on:
•Achieving vertical integration and scale in limited-license markets. The Company is committed to being vertically integrated in every state in which it operates and having 50% of its retail sales come from products it manufactures or produces. This entails controlling the entire supply chain from seed to sale. AWH is currently vertically integrated in all six states of operation. Four of the six markets in which AWH operates, are in states that pose restrictions limiting the number of licenses allowable, creating a more competitive dynamic. AWH is committed to being a top player in each of the states in which it operates. AWH does not intend to expand to new states without obtaining a large presence and proposes to expand to a new state if it has plans to expand operations to meet the states maximum allowable number of dispensaries and cultivation footprint. 
•Key flagship locations. AWH is dedicated to securing retail sites in key flagship locations. AWH believes that location is critical when it comes to the success and long-term sustainability of a dispensary. By situating the stores in marquee locations, AWH believes the barriers to entry for competition are higher. Some of AWH’s flagship locations include: 1) Ascend Collinsville, which is strategically located in the retail corridor near St. Louis, 2) Ascend Boston, which is located in downtown Boston between TD Garden and Faneuil Hall, and 3) Ascend Rochelle Park, which is located on Route 17 just a mile from the Garden State Plaza in highly trafficked northern New Jersey.
•Disciplined capital allocation and execution of mergers and acquisitions. AWH has a disciplined capital allocation strategy. The Company only deploys capital in markets and on projects which it believes will be accretive to its shareholders. To date, the bulk of the Company’s expansion has been through acquisition. The Company views M&A as the fastest path to growth given the barriers to entry and the regulatory environment in the cannabis industry. Largely due to early license awards, there are a number of independent and single-state operators in the markets in which we operate today. These assets represent 
attractive acquisition opportunities, as the Company can leverage its local permitting expertise and operational and financial resources to optimize the performance of these assets. Most of the Company’s acquisitions have been negotiated and priced prior to the respective state’s passing of recreational legislation. Many of the assets AWH has acquired have historically underperformed under their previous ownership and AWH has been able to improve the financial performance of acquired assets by implementing its standard operating procedures and technology, thereby allowing for AWH to make acquisitions that create significant value for shareholders. 
The Company has been successful in opening facilities and dispensaries and expects continued growth to be driven by opening new operational facilities and dispensaries under our current licenses, expansion of our current facilities, and increased consumer demand. 
General Development of the Business
As of December 31, 2022, AWH has direct or indirect operations or financial interests in six U.S. geographic markets: Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. AWH has expanded its operational footprint primarily through several acquisitions as identified above. See acquisition history in “History of the Company.” 
In addition to the acquisitions the Company has made, AWH has benefited from several cultivation expansion opportunities. Since inception in 2018, the Company completed cultivation builds in Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Ohio. The Company is considering expanding the New Jersey cultivation further and may consider adding additional cultivation capacity to Pennsylvania and Ohio once there is visibility on the start of adult-use sales in those states. 
Operations Summary
AWH’s core business is the cultivation, manufacturing, and distribution of cannabis consumer packaged goods, which are sold through company-owned retail stores and to third-party licensed retail cannabis stores. The Company is committed to being vertically integrated in every state in which it operates, which entails controlling the entire supply chain from seed to sale. AWH has been successful in opening facilities and dispensaries, and expects the majority of future growth to be driven by opening new operational facilities and dispensaries under current licenses, expansion of current facilities and increased consumer demand.
Cultivation
AWH’s cultivation practices have been engineered for scalability and repeatability as the Company expands into additional states. AWH aims to continuously refine cultivation operations to rapidly scale output without sacrificing quality and consistency. Future expansion is planned to provide the infrastructure to diversify the seed supply and further mechanize and automate harvest operations. AWH believes it will be able to continue to rapidly improve cultivation by increasing yields by dialing in genetics and enhancing environmental conditions. AWH is focused on driving biomass cost per gram lower with the goal of creating a competitive advantage in the limited license states in which the Company operates. AWH has used strain rationalization, improved cultivation practices, and investments in technology to drive higher yields per square foot than the industry average. 
Manufacturing
AWH’s manufacturing operations are centered around the quality of products and the efficiency of production. AWH strives to produce high quality, consistent products across its manufacturing facilities, and has implemented strict brand and quality assurance standards and standard operating procedures in an effort to ensure consistent product and consumer experience across all operating markets. AWH is focused on scaling capacity, improving yields, and increasing efficiency. AWH is standardizing and increasing capacity in hydrocarbon and ethanol extraction wherever possible with the goal of maximizing product quality and throughput and improving crude yields and is making investments in manufacturing and extraction technology, including high speed flower packaging, cartridge filling and automated pre-rolling as drivers of labor efficiency.
Wholesale distribution 
During the fourth quarter of 2022, approximately 55% of AWH wholesale sales were generated by sales of Ascend products to third-party retailers. AWH aims to grow the wholesale business to half of the total business by: 1) increasing wholesale market share and expanding penetration within wholesale distribution, 2) selling higher volumes of product to wholesale customers, and 3) expanding the category set to higher value products sold to wholesale customers. As of December 31, 2022, AWH sold products to 99% of the dispensaries in Illinois, but the Company has room to significantly increase market penetration across its other states. AWH has internal sales managers dedicated to these penetration efforts. 
AWH is also acutely focused on category management and expansion. AWH’s development efforts are focused on pre-rolls, vapes, edibles, and other ready-to-use product forms that it expects to outperform whole flower over time. The Company is also concentrating on expanding the vape offering, including live products and ratio products that represent fast growing segments of the vape category, and expanding the pre-roll offering. The Company expects the pre-roll category to grow significantly as the preferred way to consume flower for many customers. In 2021, AWH launched a pre-roll partnership with Lowell Smokes and in 2022 the Company launched multiple additional pre-roll SKUs in smaller sizes, innovative multi-pack options, and premium infused pre-rolls. During 2022, the Company also launched a pre-roll partnership with Miss Grass that has been well received by customers. AWH continues to expand the edibles manufacturing capabilities to provide micro-dose product forms along with additional forms desired by the market. Strategic partnerships are a key part of diversifying and expanding the Company’s offering.
Retail
AWH operates both licensed retail adult-use and medicinal cannabis dispensaries. The Ascend retail brand aims to elevate the cannabis shopping experience by combining consistent and convenient customer service with high-quality products and exclusive brand partnerships. AWH believes the retail operating principles described below differentiate the Company from its competitors. 
•Location. All of the Company’s dispensaries are located in key retail locations. AWH believes location is a huge barrier to entry for defending its competitive positioning overtime. Each of the Company’s dispensaries are located within a turn off of a major highway or in a highly trafficked downtown. 
•Vision. Ascend believes in using the power of the cannabis plant to help people better their lives. As a company, AWH has a strong commitment to the success of the brand and maintaining this vision.
•People and Culture. AWH aims to hire store managers with prior experience in cannabis and has an acute focus on talent development for the rest of the store employees. The Company has an extensive onboarding and training program focused not only on brand and product knowledge, but also on creating a great customer experience. AWH employees are motivated by daily sales goals set at the stores. AWH reaches these goals by ensuring it has the right product and the right talent in place to deliver a best-in-class customer experience. Stores measure week over week sales growth, peak days for volume, transactions, gross margin and other key performance metrics.
•High Volume Focus. AWH is focused on driving high transaction volume in its retail stores. The Company improves traffic with increased number of point of sales systems, optimized store layouts, and enhanced menu management. 
•Omni-channel experiences. As customer shopping preferences continue to evolve and customers increasingly shop across multiple channels, AWH strives to create a best-in-class, omni-channel customer experience. These experiences have been especially critical to operations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Omni-channel experiences include: 
◦Reserve-Online-Pickup-in-Store. This allows customers to purchase merchandise through letsascend.com and pick-up the merchandise in-store, which often drives incremental in-store sales. Over 90% of customers in Collinsville utilize the Reserve-Online-Pickup-in-Store option.
◦Delivery. AWH now has delivery programs out of Newton, Massachusetts; Boston Massachusetts; and throughout Michigan. Delivery enables AWH to bring customers the products they enjoy straight to the comfort of their homes. 
◦Curbside Pickup. This offering allows customers to have their orders brought directly to their vehicles.
◦Online Consultations and Real-time Chat. This allows customers to interact with associates, ask questions and build their basket ahead of their in-store visit, driving associate productivity and incremental sales.
Strategic Sourcing
Ascend continues to focus on supply chain optimization and strategic sourcing as the Company scales, allowing our growing base to provide leverage across the organization. This includes a focus on supplier rationalization, so that best-in-class supply partners are providing full end-to-end service across the enterprise. Building a common base of operating procedures, packaging and supply components, and supply partners across the organization is critical to this strategic direction.
Environmental, Social, and Governance
Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) initiatives are at the core of AWH’s guiding principles. AWH is committed to creating an inclusive, sustainable company that provides best-in-class governance. Below are a few of the key ESG initiatives at AWH. 
•Social Justice. While AWH understands and appreciates how fortunate the Company is to be in a position to help build and guide the future of modern cannabis, AWH is also acutely aware of the lives that have been destroyed, especially in minority communities, through decades of unjust laws and inequitable enforcement. AWH has been a long standing partner with the Last Prisoner Project (“LPP”) to support their effort to push to get non-violent offenders released from prison. Since the inception of our partnership in 2020, together with our customers, contributions to LPP have surpassed $2 million. This partnership directly enabled: the release of 21 constituents, matching 60 constituents with pro bono attorneys, and $1 million in micro-grants. In addition to this partnership, AWH’s in-house Social Equity team hosted five expungement clinics during 2022 providing expungement and other legal services to formerly incarcerated individuals. Among other things, the internal Social Equity team also offered technical assistance to 25 social equity applicants.
•Governance. Governance and disclosure are important to AWH. This year, the Compensation and Governance Committee and the Audit Committee became fully independent. The Company provides GAAP financials and publishes its key governance policies, as well as provides access to its whistleblower hotline on its investor website. 
•Environmental. In January 2022, AWH began planting in its first greenhouse at our Barry, Illinois cultivation location. Greenhouses consume less energy than indoor grows because they subsidize their energy needs with the sun. On average, the greenhouse consumed less than 20% of power per sq. ft of cultivation compared to the rest of the portfolio. This year, AWH also participated in its first 21-day eco-challenge, during which individuals tasked themselves to make small changes that have a positive impact on communities and the planet. 67 Ascend employees completed 1,260 actions during the challenge, resulting in: 10,000 gallons of water saved, 104 donations made to organizations to support the planet, 1,165 pounds of CO2 saved, and 240 vegan were meals consumed, among other contributions. AWH will continue to explore other solutions to lower its environmental impact.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2,200 employees, approximately 90% of whom were in field operations and approximately 10% of whom were in corporate administrative and management. Approximately 23% were represented by five collective bargaining agreements that were entered during 2022 with local chapters of labor unions, with expiration dates ranging from January 2025 to June 2025. One additional collective bargaining agreement was entered into during January 2023 and expires in January 2026. We have not experienced any significant work slowdowns, stoppages, or other labor disruptions. The Company considers its employee relations to be generally positive. 
We offer our employees opportunities to grow and develop their careers and provide them with a wide array of company paid benefits and compensation packages which we believe are competitive relative to our peers in the industry. As of December 31, 2022, 23% of leadership positions (defined as supervisor and above) were held by racial minorities and 38% of leadership positions were held by women. AWH will continue to work towards achieving a more equitable balance of genders and races across the company and in leadership. 
Employee safety and health in the workplace is one of our core values. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, we have taken actions aligned with the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to protect our workforce so they can more safely and effectively perform their work. 
The Company’s number and levels of employees are continually aligned with the pace and growth of our business and management believes it has sufficient human capital to operate the business successfully. 
Operations by State
The following is an overview of our cultivation and dispensary assets by state that are currently operational, as well as our expected asset base once fully built out.
Cultivation assets:
Across its cultivation assets, as of December 31, 2022, AWH had 245,000 square feet of total canopy, which is defined as the square footage of flower, vegetation, and propagation tables. The Company estimates each square foot of total canopy has the power to generate approximately half a pound of cannabis per year. All of the Company’s cultivation and planned cultivation facilities are indoor, with the exception of the 55,000 square foot greenhouse in Illinois. The Company believes that indoor grow facilities allow for fine-tuned controls which help enable AWH to grow high-quality cannabis. All of the cultivation projects underway are expansion projects to existing cultivation facilities. The Company deems these as lower risk than green fielding at new sites that are not yet permitted for cultivation operations. The new cultivation plans are flexible and will ultimately depend on market conditions, local licensing, construction, and other regulatory permissions. All of our expansion plans are subject to capital allocation decisions, the evolving regulatory environment and the COVID-19 pandemic. See “Forward-Looking Statements.”

State | Square Feet of Canopy as of December 31, 2022 | Additional Comments 
Illinois | 113,000 | Located in Barry, Illinois, the cultivation facility also has ethane and butane-based extraction equipment and kitchen. 
Michigan | 28,000 | Located in Lansing, Michigan, the cultivation facility has 28,000 square feet of canopy. The Company added a kitchen in 2022. 
Massachusetts | 54,000 | Located in Athol, Massachusetts, the cultivation facility underwent a phase 2 expansion which it completed in 2022. The Company recently added ethane and butane-based extraction equipment and kitchen.
New Jersey | 42,000 | Located in Franklin, New Jersey, the cultivation facility recently underwent expansion adding 22,000 square feet of canopy and a lab and kitchen. 
Ohio | 2,000 | Located in Monroe, Ohio the facility currently has 2,000 square feet of canopy. In October 2022, the Company completed an acquisition of a processing facility located near the cultivation facility. 
Pennsylvania | 6,000 | Located in Smithfield, Pennsylvania the facility currently has 6,000 square feet of canopy. 

Dispensary assets
As of December 31, 2022, AWH had 24 open and operating retail locations. AWH anticipates expanding to 39 open and operating dispensaries by mid-2024, including acquisitions that are pending close. The new store opening plans are also flexible and will ultimately depend on market conditions, local licensing, construction, and other regulatory permissions. All of the dispensary plans are subject to capital allocation decisions, the evolving regulatory environment and the COVID-19 pandemic. See “Forward-Looking Statements.”

State | Open Dispensaries as of December 31, 2022 | Owned or Pending Dispensaries and Licenses as of December 31, 2022 (includes pending acquisitions) | Comments(1) 
Illinois | 8 | 10 | 4 dispensaries in the Chicago area; 2 in Southern IL bordering Missouri; 2 near Springfield, IL. The state caps recreational dispensary licenses at 10 stores per owner. The Company has entered definitive agreements to acquire 2 additional licenses which would bring it to the 10 state cap.
Massachusetts | | | Open dispensaries at year end included 1 in downtown Boston and 1 in Newton; subsequently opened 1 dispensary in New Bedford. The state caps recreational dispensary licenses at 3 stores per owner. 
New Jersey | 3 | 3 | 1 dispensary in Rochelle Park; 1 in Montclair; 1 in Fort Lee. The state caps recreational dispensary licenses at 3 stores per owner. 
Michigan | | | 7 dispensaries throughout the state; 1 in Grand Rapids opened in March 2023. 
Ohio | 2 | 5 | 2 dispensaries in the greater Columbus area. The state caps dispensary licenses at 5 stores per owner. The Company has entered definitive agreement to acquire 1 license which would permit them to 3 additional dispensaries which would bring it to the 5 state cap. 
Pennsylvania | 2 | 6 | The Company opened its Scranton and Wayne dispensaries in Q4 2022. It plans to open the remaining 4 over the next year.

Competitive Conditions 
Competition
The Company primarily competes with:
•Multi-State Operators (“MSOs”). AWH competes with MSOs from a retail and wholesale perspective, including Trulieve Cannabis Corp., Jushi Holdings Inc., Verano Holdings Corp., Cresco Labs Inc., Green Thumb Industries Inc., Curaleaf Holdings Inc., TerrAscend Corp., and Ayr Wellness Inc, among others. The specific competitors vary for each state of AWH’s operations. For example, Cresco is AWH’s primary wholesale competitor in Illinois, but not as big of a wholesale competitor in New Jersey. 
•Single State Operators (“SSOs”). AWH competes with many single state operators across its portfolio. 
•Consumer Packaged Goods Companies (“CPG Companies”). Although not a competitive threat today, AWH anticipates CPG Companies gaining a larger presence in the industry if and when cannabis is rendered federally legal. 
•Pharmaceutical Companies. Although not a competitive threat today, AWH anticipates pharmaceutical companies gaining a larger presence in the industry if and when cannabis is rendered federally legal. 
The Company believes it is well-poised in its competitive positioning due to the competitive advantages highlighted below: 
•Scale and vertical integration. The Company’s scale helps it compete, particularly, against the SSOs who may not be able to obtain the same operating synergies that AWH can. AWH is vertically integrated in each of its states of operation and only operates in states where it can have where it believes it can be a top 5 player one day. 
•Access to capital. The Company’s access to capital helps it compete, particularly, against the SSOs who may not have the resources that AWH does. AWH management has also been able to leverage its extensive capital markets knowledge, securing $275.0 million in senior debt with an interest rate of 9.5% per annum, which at the time of the deal was an industry leading cost of capital. 
•States of operation. With the exception of Michigan and New Jersey, all of AWH’s states of operation are limited license. 
•Management. AWH has a diverse management team with experience spanning capital markets, cannabis industry, regulatory, and operations. The management team has proven it can lead, by becoming a top 3 operator in the state of Illinois. 
•Location and second mover advantage. While many competitors who were early entrants to the space were pushed into industrial parks or off the beaten path, AWH locations can often be found on the corner of Main & Main, surrounded by other top tier businesses such as Trader Joe’s & Starbucks. This is because AWH entered the business slightly later than some of its peers. In doing so, the Company strategically acquired locations, rather than pursuing a lottery strategy to obtain licenses. AWH was able to use its ‘second-mover advantage’ to secure highly desirable retail locations, many of which it considers to be flagship stores. 
•Differentiated portfolio of brands. AWH provides a robust offering and a wide range of branded products spanning every price point with products targeted to every demographic. 
Overview of Government Regulation
On February 8, 2018, the Canadian Securities Administrators revised their previously released Staff Notice 51-532 – Issuers with U.S. Marijuana-Related Activities (“Staff Notice 51-532”), which provides specific disclosure expectations for issuers that currently have, or are in the process of developing, cannabis related activities in the United States as permitted within a particular State’s regulatory framework. In accordance with the Staff Notice 51-532, below is a discussion of the federal and state-level U.S. regulatory regimes in those jurisdictions where we are currently directly involved, through our subsidiaries, in the cannabis industry. Our subsidiaries and licensed operators with which we have contractual relationships are directly engaged in the manufacture, possession, sale, or distribution of cannabis in the adult-use and/or medical cannabis marketplace in the states of Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Further, on January 25, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement (the “Maryland Agreement”) to acquire 100% of the membership interests of Devi Holdings, Inc. (“Devi”), which owns and operates four licensed medical cannabis dispensaries in Maryland. Under the Maryland Agreement, we will also acquire the real property of the four dispensary locations. The Maryland Agreement is subject to regulatory review and approval. In accordance with Staff Notice 51-532, we evaluate, monitor, and reassess this disclosure, and any related risks, on an ongoing basis and the same will be supplemented and amended to investors in public filings, including in the event of government policy changes or the introduction of new or amended guidance, laws, or regulations regarding cannabis regulation. We intend to promptly remedy any known occurrences of non-compliance with applicable state and local cannabis rules and regulations, and intend to publicly disclose any material non-compliance, citations, or notices of violation which may have an impact on our licenses, business activities, or operations. The Company has received and continues to receive legal input regarding (a) compliance with applicable state regulatory frameworks in the states of Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Maryland and (b) potential exposure and implications arising from U.S. federal law. The Company receives such advice on an ongoing basis but has not received a formal legal opinion on such matters.
The U.S. federal government regulates drugs through the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811) (the “CSA”), which places controlled substances, including cannabis, in a schedule. Cannabis is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. The CSA explicitly prohibits the manufacturing, distribution, selling, and possession of cannabis and cannabis-derived products as a consequence of its Schedule I classification. Classification of substances under the CSA is determined jointly by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”) and the FDA. The United States Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) defines Schedule I drugs and substances as drugs with no currently accepted medical use, a high potential for abuse, and a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision. However, the FDA has approved Epidiolex, which contains a purified form of cannabidiol (“CBD”), a non-psychoactive cannabinoid in the cannabis plant, for the treatment of seizures associated with two epilepsy conditions. The FDA has not approved cannabis or cannabis derived compounds as a safe and effective drug for any other condition. Moreover, under the 2018 Farm Bill or Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, CBD remains a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA, with a narrow exception for hemp which is defined as cannabis with a tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) concentration of less than 0.3% on a dry weight basis. 
Unlike in Canada, where federal legislation uniformly governs the cultivation, distribution, sale, and possession of medical and adult-use cannabis under the Cannabis Act, S.C. 2018, c. 16, and the Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations, cannabis is largely regulated at the state level in the United States. To date, there are 37 states, plus the District of Columbia (and the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands), that have laws and/or regulations that recognize, in one form or another, legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment. In addition, the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, the District of Columbia, and 21 states, including Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington have legalized cannabis for adult-use. Eleven states have also enacted low-THC/high-CBD only laws for medical cannabis patients.
State laws that permit and regulate the production, distribution and use of cannabis for adult-use or medical purposes are in direct conflict with the CSA, which makes cannabis use, distribution and possession federally illegal. Although certain states and territories of the U.S. authorize medical or adult-use cannabis production and distribution by licensed or registered entities, under U.S. federal law, the possession, cultivation, and transfer of cannabis and any related drug paraphernalia is illegal and any such acts are criminal acts under any and all circumstances under the CSA. The Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution establishes that the United States Constitution and federal laws made pursuant to it are paramount and in case of conflict between federal and state law, the federal law shall apply. Although the Company’s activities are compliant with applicable United States state and local law, strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve the Company of liability under United States federal law, nor may it provide a defense to any federal proceeding which may be brought against the Company.
The Obama administration attempted to address the inconsistent treatment of cannabis under state and federal law in the Cole Memorandum which outlined certain priorities for the DOJ relating to the prosecution of cannabis offenses. The Cole Memorandum acknowledged that, notwithstanding the designation of cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance at the federal level, several states had enacted laws authorizing the use of cannabis for medical or adult-use purposes. The Cole Memorandum noted that jurisdictions that have enacted laws legalizing cannabis in some form have also implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, processing, distribution, sale and possession of cannabis. As such, conduct in compliance with those laws and regulations is less likely to implicate the Cole Memorandum’s enforcement priorities. The DOJ did not provide (and has not provided since) specific guidelines for what regulatory and enforcement systems would be deemed sufficient under the Cole Memorandum. In light of limited investigative and prosecutorial resources, the Cole Memorandum concluded that the DOJ should be focused on addressing only the most significant threats related to cannabis, such as distribution of cannabis from states where cannabis is legal to those where cannabis is illegal, the diversion of cannabis revenues to illicit drug cartels and sales of cannabis to minors.
On January 4, 2018, former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued the Sessions Memorandum, which rescinded the Cole Memorandum effective upon its issuance. The Sessions Memorandum stated, in part, that current law reflects “Congress’ determination that cannabis is a dangerous drug and cannabis activity is a serious crime,” and Mr. Sessions directed all U.S. Attorneys to enforce the laws enacted by Congress by following well-established 
principles when pursuing prosecutions related to cannabis activities. We are not aware of any prosecutions of investment companies doing routine business with licensed cannabis related businesses in light of the new DOJ position. However, there can be no assurance that the federal government will not enforce federal laws relating to cannabis in the future. As a result of the Sessions Memorandum, federal prosecutors are now free to utilize their prosecutorial discretion to decide whether to prosecute cannabis activities, despite the existence of state-level laws that may be inconsistent with federal prohibitions. No direction was given to federal prosecutors in the Sessions Memorandum as to the priority they should ascribe to such cannabis activities, and thus it is uncertain how active U.S. federal prosecutors will be in relation to such activities.
The former Attorneys General who succeeded former Attorney General Sessions following his resignation did not provide a clear policy directive for the United States as it pertains to state-legal cannabis related activities. President Joseph R. Biden was sworn in as the 46th United States President on January 20, 2021. President Biden nominated Merrick Garland to serve as Attorney General in his administration. It is not yet known whether the Department of Justice under President Biden and Attorney General Garland, confirmed on March 10, 2021, will re-adopt the Cole Memorandum or announce a substantive cannabis enforcement policy. At Mr. Garland’s confirmation hearing, he stated, “It does not seem to me a useful use of limited resources that we have, to be pursuing prosecutions in states that have legalized and that are regulating the use of marijuana, either medically or otherwise.” He has not, however, reissued the Cole Memorandum or otherwise provided guidance. If the Department of Justice policy under Attorney General Garland were to aggressively pursue financiers or owners of cannabis-related businesses, and United States Attorneys followed such Department of Justice policies through pursuing prosecutions, then the Company could face (i) seizure of its cash and other assets used to support or derived from its cannabis operations, (ii) the arrest of its employees, directors, officers, managers and investors, and charges of ancillary criminal violations of the Controlled Substances Act for aiding and abetting and conspiring to violate the Controlled Substances Act by virtue of providing financial support to cannabis companies that service or provide goods to state-licensed or permitted cultivators, processors, distributors, and/or retailers of cannabis, and/or (iii) the barring of its employees, directors, officers, managers and investors who are not United States citizens from entry into the United States for life. Unless and until the United States Congress amends the Controlled Substances Act with respect to cannabis (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments there can be no assurance), there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current U.S. federal law criminalizing cannabis.
While federal prosecutors appear to continue to use the Cole Memorandum’s priorities as an enforcement guide, the prosecutorial effects resulting from the rescission of the Cole Memorandum and the implementation of the Sessions Memorandum remain uncertain. The sheer size of the cannabis industry, in addition to participation by state and local governments and investors, suggests that a large-scale federal enforcement operation may create unwanted political backlash for the DOJ. It is also possible that the revocation of the Cole Memorandum could motivate Congress to reconcile federal and state laws. While Congress is considering and has considered legislation that may address these issues, there can be no assurance that such legislation passes. Regardless, at this time, cannabis remains a Schedule I controlled substance at the federal level. The U.S. federal government has always reserved the right to enforce federal law in regard to the sale and disbursement of medical or adult-use cannabis, even if state law authorizes such sale and disbursement. It is unclear whether the risk of enforcement has been altered.
Additionally, under United States federal law, it may potentially be a violation of federal money laundering statutes for financial institutions to take any proceeds from the sale of cannabis or any other Schedule I controlled substance. Canadian banks are likewise hesitant to deal with cannabis companies, due to the uncertain legal and regulatory framework of the industry. Banks and other financial institutions, particularly those that are federally chartered in the United States, could be prosecuted and possibly convicted of money laundering for providing services to cannabis businesses. While Congress is considering legislation that may address these issues, there can be no assurance of the content of any proposed legislation or that such legislation is ever passed.
Despite these laws, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s United States Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) issued a memorandum (the “FinCEN Memorandum”) outlining guidance for financial institutions that bank state-sanctioned cannabis businesses in compliance with federal enforcement priorities. The FinCEN Memorandum echoed the enforcement priorities of the Cole Memorandum. Under these guidelines, financial institutions must submit a Suspicious Activity Report (“SAR”) in connection with all cannabis-related 
banking activities by any client of such financial institution, in accordance with federal money laundering laws. These cannabis-related SARs are divided into three categories - cannabis limited, cannabis priority, and cannabis terminated - based on the financial institution’s belief that the business in question follows state law, is operating outside of compliance with state law, or where the banking relationship has been terminated, respectively. On the same day that the FinCEN Memorandum was published, the DOJ issued a memorandum (the “2014 Cole Memorandum”) directing prosecutors to apply the enforcement priorities of the Cole Memorandum in determining whether to charge individuals or institutions with crimes related to financial transactions involving the proceeds of cannabis-related conduct. The 2014 Cole Memorandum has been rescinded as of January 4, 2018, along with the Cole Memorandum, removing guidance that enforcement of applicable financial crimes against state-compliant actors was not a DOJ priority.
However, former Attorney General Sessions’ revocation of the Cole Memorandum and the 2014 Cole Memorandum has not affected the status of the FinCEN Memorandum, nor has the Department of the Treasury given any indication that it intends to rescind the FinCEN Memorandum itself. Though it was originally intended for the 2014 Cole Memorandum and the FinCEN Memorandum to work in tandem, the FinCEN Memorandum is a standalone document which explicitly lists the eight enforcement priorities originally cited in the Cole Memorandum. As such, the FinCEN Memorandum remains intact, indicating that the Department of the Treasury and FinCEN intend to continue abiding by its guidance. However, in the United States, it is difficult for cannabis-based businesses to open and maintain a bank account with any bank or other financial institution. 
One legislative safeguard for the medical cannabis industry, appended to the federal budget bill, remains in place following the rescission of the Cole Memorandum. For fiscal years 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022, Congress has included a rider to the Consolidated Appropriations Acts (currently referred to as the “Rohrabacher/Blumenauer Amendment”) to prevent the federal government from using congressionally appropriated funds to enforce federal cannabis laws against regulated medical cannabis actors operating in compliance with state and local law. The Rohrabacher/Blumenauer Amendment was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022 signed into law by President Biden on March 15, 2022. The Rohrabacher/Blumenauer Amendment will remain effective through December 16, 2022. The Rohrabacher/Blumenauer Amendment was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 signed into law by President Biden on December 29, 2022. The Rohrabacher/Blumenauer Amendment will remain in effect through the fiscal year, which ends September 30, 2023. There is no guarantee that the Rohrabacher/Blumenauer Amendment will be included in the omnibus appropriations package or a continuing budget resolution once the current Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 expires.
Despite the rescission of the Cole Memorandum, the DOJ appears to continue to adhere to the enforcement priorities set forth in the Cole Memorandum. The Cole Memorandum and the Rohrabacher/Blumenauer Amendment gave licensed cannabis operators (particularly medical cannabis operators) and investors in states with legal regimes greater certainty regarding the DOJ’s enforcement priorities and the risk of operating cannabis businesses. While the Sessions Memorandum has introduced some uncertainty regarding federal enforcement, the cannabis industry continues to experience growth in legal medical and adult-use markets across the United States. Accordingly, as an industry best practice, we continue to employ the following policies to ensure compliance with the guidance provided by the Cole Memorandum:
•ensure that its operations are compliant with all licensing requirements as established by the applicable state, county, municipality, town, township, borough, and other political/administrative divisions;
•ensure that its cannabis related activities adhere to the scope of the licensing obtained (for example: in the states where cannabis is permitted only for adult-use, the products are only sold to individuals who meet the requisite age requirements);
•implement policies and procedures to ensure that cannabis products are not distributed to minors;
•implement policies and procedures in place to ensure that funds are not distributed to criminal enterprises, gangs or cartels;
•implement an inventory tracking system and necessary procedures to ensure that such compliance system is effective in tracking inventory and preventing diversion of cannabis or cannabis products into those states where cannabis is not permitted by state law, or cross any state lines in general;
•ensure that its state-authorized cannabis business activity is not used as a cover or pretense for trafficking of other illegal drugs, and is not engaged in any other illegal activity, or any activities that are contrary to any applicable anti-money laundering statutes; and
•ensure that its products comply with applicable regulations and contain necessary disclaimers about the contents of the products to prevent adverse public health consequences from cannabis use and prevent impaired driving.
On December 4, 2020, the House of Representatives passed the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2019 (the “MORE Act”). The MORE Act would provide for the removal of cannabis from the list of controlled substances in the CSA and other federal legislation. It would end the applicability of Section 280E to cannabis businesses but would impose a 5% federal excise tax. The MORE Act was not passed by the Senate prior to the end of the 116th Congress, but an updated version was subsequently reintroduced in the House of Representatives on May 28, 2021. On September 30, 2021, the House Judiciary Committee voted to advance the MORE Act once again in a first step towards passage in the full Hose. On April 1, 2022, the House of Representatives passed the MORE Act once again. Before it could become law, the MORE Act would need to be passed by the Senate and then signed into law by the president. There is no guarantee the MORE Act will become law in its current form. 
H.R. 1595, the SAFE Banking Act of 2019, which would expand financial services in the United States to cannabis-related legitimate businesses and service providers, was introduced in the House of Representatives on March 7, 2019 with bipartisan support. On April 11, 2019, S. 1200, the Senate version of the SAFE Banking Act, was filed. This bill also has bipartisan support and more than a fifth of the total Senate, 27 members, co-sponsored it. On September 25, 2019, H.R. 1595 passed in the House of Representatives by a vote of 321 to 103, but it stalled in the Senate. The SAFE Banking Act passed the House again on May 15, 2020, when it was included in the COVID-19 stimulus bill, the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act. However, that measure also stalled in the Senate. The SAFE Banking Act passed the House again on April 19, 2021 as H.R. 1996, by a vote of 321 – 101. On September 23, 2021, the House approved the National Defense Authorization Act (“NDAA”) that contained the provisions of the SAFE Banking Act. The SAFE Banking Act was subsequently removed from the NDAA by the House-Senate conference committee on December 7, 2021, and was not included in the final version of the NDAA. On February 4, 2022, the House approved The America COMPETES Act of 2022, which includes the provisions of the Safe Banking Act. The Senate’s final version of the bill, which was passed on March 28, 2022, removed the provisions related to the SAFE Banking Act. There is no guarantee the SAFE Banking Act will become law in its current form, if at all. 
On July 21, 2022, the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act (“CAOA”) was introduced in the Senate. The CAOA, if enacted, would, among other impacts, remove marijuana from the CSA, impose excise taxes on the sale of marijuana, and create a federal regulatory framework for the marijuana industry. There is no certainty that the CAOA will become law in its current form or at all.
On October 6, 2022, President Biden announced that he directed the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services and Attorney General Merrick Garland to initiate a review of marijuana’s classification as a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA. The timing and outcome of this review is uncertain and there is no certainty that marijuana will be placed under a different schedule or de-scheduled, and there is also no certainty as to the impacts such actions would have on our business or the marijuana industry as a whole, particularly when considering potential implications for federal regulation and interstate commerce. 
On December 2, 2022, President Biden signed into law H.R. 8454, the “Medical Marijuana and Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act,” (the “Research Expansion Act”) which establishes a new registration process for conducting research on marijuana and for manufacturing marijuana products for research purposes and drug development. The Research Expansion Act is the first piece of standalone federal cannabis reform legislation in U.S 
history. Among other things, the Research Expansion Act ; (i) directs the DEA to register practitioners to conduct cannabis and CBD research and manufacturers to supply cannabis for research purposes; (ii) expressly allows the DEA to register manufacturers and distributors of cannabis or CBD for the purposes of commercial production of a drug approved by the FDA; (iii) requires the DEA to assess whether there is an adequate and uninterrupted supply of cannabis for research purposes; (iii) permits registered entities to manufacture, distribute, dispense, or possess cannabis or CBD for purposes of medical research; (iv) clarifies that physicians do not violate the CSA when they discuss the potential harms and benefits of cannabis and CBD with patients; and (v) directs the DHHS to coordinate with the National Institutes of Health and other agencies to report on the “therapeutic potential” of cannabis for conditions such as epilepsy, and the impact of cannabis on adolescent brain development.
The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2023 was signed into law by President Biden on December 23, 2022. The NDAA, which passed in the House of Representatives on December 8, 2022 and the Senate on December 15, 2022, failed to include the Safe Banking Act or any of its provisions. 
The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 was signed into law by President Biden on December 29, 2022. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, which passed the House of Representatives on December 23, 2022, and the Senate on December 22, 2022, failed to include the Safe Banking Act or any of its provisions. 
As of December 31, 2022, there can be no assurance that the CAOA, the Safe Banking Act, or similar comprehensive legislation that would de-schedule cannabis and/or decriminalize cannabis will be passed in the near future or at all. Further, there is also no certainty as to the impacts such actions would have on our business or the marijuana industry as a whole, particularly when considering potential implications for federal regulation and interstate commerce. 
Compliance with Applicable State Laws in the United States
We are in compliance with applicable cannabis licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by each state in which we currently operate. We have in place a detailed compliance program and an internal legal and compliance department, and we are building out our operational compliance team across all states in which we operate. Our compliance department is overseen by our President and further consists of compliance professionals who oversee and ensure compliance in each of our jurisdictions and facilities. We also have external state and local regulatory/compliance counsel engaged in every jurisdiction in which we operate.
We provide training for all relevant employees, using various methods on the following topics relevant to job tasks: compliance with state laws and rules; patient education materials; education materials for recreational customers; security in our facilities and establishments; handwashing and sanitation practices; packaging procedures; state mandated tracking software; establishment specific tracking; track and trace; inventory and POS software; audit procedures; epidemic responses; emergency situation response; dispensing procedures; patient/client check-in procedure; employee education and consultation materials; packaging and labeling requirements; cannabis waste and destruction; active shooter response; robbery response; fire response; bomb-threat response; sexual harassment; drug free workplace; internet and phone usage; discrimination harassment; workplace violence; hygiene and clothing requirements; hand washing; medical emergency response; biocontamination response; gas leak response; visitor access; discounts for special groups; customer loyalty programs; client intake; storage and recall of products; the science of cannabis; speaking with physicians; edibles education; reconciling transactions; inventory control; receiving inventory; shipping inventory; corrective and preventive action plans; filing corrective and preventive action reports; pesticides; wastewater; irrigation systems; fertilizer; beneficial organisms; climate control; transplanting; inventory tagging; pruning; defoliation; drying, trimming and curing; storage of products; maintaining confidentiality; cash handling; and preventing diversion of products.
We emphasize security and inventory control to ensure strict monitoring of cannabis and inventory, from delivery by a licensed distributor to sale or disposal. Only authorized, properly trained employees are allowed to access our computerized inventory control system.
We monitor all compliance notifications from the regulators and inspectors in each market and timely resolve any issues identified. We keep records of all compliance notifications received from the state regulators or 
inspectors, as well as how and when an issue was resolved. Moreover, we monitor news sources for information regarding developments at the state and federal level relating to the regulation and criminalization of cannabis.
Further, we have created comprehensive standard operating procedures that include detailed descriptions and instructions for receiving shipments of inventory, inventory tracking, recordkeeping and record retention practices related to inventory. We also have comprehensive standard operating procedures in place for performing inventory reconciliation, and ensuring the accuracy of inventory tracking and recordkeeping. We maintain accurate records of our inventory at all licensed facilities. Adherence to our standard operating procedures is mandatory and helps ensure that our operations are compliant with the rules set forth by the applicable state and local laws, regulations, ordinances, licenses and other requirements. We enforce adherence to standard operating procedures by regularly conducting internal inspections and ensures that any issues identified are resolved quickly and thoroughly.
We maintain strict compliance guidelines with respect to online reservations of products. No purchase and sale transactions may be completed online. A patient, patient’s primary caregiver or customer may reserve products online, but the patient or customer must be physically present at one of our dispensaries to complete the transaction. This requirement allows our dispensary staff to ensure that our standard operating procedures (including its compliance programs) are applied to all patients, patient’s primary caregivers and customers in connection with the purchase and sale of products.
In jurisdictions where medical cannabis is legal, upon arrival of the patient or the patient’s primary caregiver at the applicable dispensary, dispensary staff must verify the patient’s or the patient’s primary caregiver’s identity and credentials (such as a state-issued medical cannabis card) and confirm the patient’s allotment amount to ensure the user is not exceeding the state’s dispensing limits. Once the foregoing is verified, the patient or the patient’s primary caregiver may pay for the products to complete the purchase. If the customer does not have valid identification and credentials, the customer will not be able to purchase medical cannabis at the applicable dispensary, irrespective of any reservations made online.
In jurisdictions where recreational cannabis is legal, upon arrival at the dispensary, a customer must present government-issued photo identification to verify they are at least 21 years of age. Once the identification is verified, the customer may pay for the products to complete the transaction. If the customer does not have valid identification, the customer will not be able to purchase recreational cannabis at the applicable Company dispensary, irrespective of any reservations made online.
We will continue to monitor compliance on an ongoing basis in accordance with our compliance program and standard operating procedures. While our operations are in full compliance with all applicable state laws, regulations and licensing requirements, such activities remain illegal under federal law. For the reasons described above and the risks further described in the section entitled “Risk Factors,” there are significant risks associated with our business.
State Regulation of Cannabis 
The risk of federal enforcement and other risks associated with our business are described in the section entitled “Risk Factors.” 
Following the thesis that distributing brands at scale will win, we enter markets where we believe that we can profitably and sustainably operate and command significant market share, and thus maximize consumer and brand awareness. The regulatory frameworks enacted by the states, which are similar to the limited and controlled issuance of gaming or alcohol distributorship licenses, provide macro-level indication of whether certain state markets will be sustainable and profitable.
Below is a summary overview of the regulatory and competitive frameworks in each of our operating markets. 
Illinois
Illinois Regulatory Landscape
In January 2014, the Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act, which allows individuals diagnosed with certain debilitating or “qualified” medical conditions to access medical cannabis, became effective. There are over 35 qualifying conditions as part of the medical program, including epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In January 2019, the Illinois Department of Health launched the Opioid Alternative Pilot Program that allows individuals who have/could receive a prescription for opioids to access medical cannabis. 
On August 28, 2018, Public Act 100-1114, the Alternative to Opioids Act of 2018, was signed into law, making changes to the Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act. The Public Act created the Opioid Alternative Pilot Program (“OAPP”), which allows access to medical cannabis for individuals who have or could receive a prescription for opioids as certified by a physician licensed in Illinois.
On August 12, 2019 Governor J.B. Pritzker signed into law legislation that made the program permanent and added 11 conditions to the existing program. 
In June 2019, Illinois legalized adult-use cannabis pursuant to the Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act (the “IL Act”). Effective January 1, 2020, Illinois residents 21 years of age and older may possess up to 30 grams of cannabis (non-residents may possess up to 15 grams). The IL Act authorizes the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (the “IDFPR”) to issue up to 75 Conditional Adult Use Dispensing Organization licenses before May 1, 2020 and an additional 110 conditional licenses during 2021. No person may hold a financial interest in more than 10 dispensing organizations. Existing medical dispensaries were able to apply for an “Early Approval Adult Use Dispensing Organization License” to serve adult purchasers at an existing medical dispensary or at a secondary site. The IDFPR also held an application period for Conditional Adult Use Cannabis Dispensary Licenses from December 10, 2019 through January 2, 2020. On September 3, 2021, the IDFPR announced the results of the lotteries to award 185 conditional adult use dispensing licenses. On June 23, 2022, a corrective lottery was conducted for up to 75 additional licenses. As of December 12, 2022, 192 conditional licenses have been issued. On January 30, 2023, the IDFPR began accepting applications for 55 additional Conditional Adult Use Cannabis Dispensary Licenses which will be distributed across 17 Bureau of Labor Statistics (“BLS”) regions to candidates that meet certain social equity eligibility criteria.
The Illinois Department of Agriculture (the “IL Ag. Department”) is authorized to make up to 30 cultivation center licenses available for medical and adult-use programs. As with existing medical dispensaries, existing cultivation centers were able to apply for an “Early Approval Adult Use Cultivation Center License.” The IL Act requires the IL Ag. Department to issue up to 60 craft grower licenses by December 21, 2021, and states the IL Ag. Department may also issue up to 60 infuser licenses by the same date. On August 2, 2021, the IL Ag. Department announced that it had issued 32 initial craft grow licenses, 28 infuser licenses, and 9 transporter licenses. As of June 1, 2022, the IL Ag. Department has awarded a total of 341 adult use cannabis licenses for craft growers, infusers, and transporters under the IL Act. No person can hold a financial interest in more than three cultivation centers, and the centers are limited to 210,000 square feet of canopy space. Cultivation centers are also prohibited from discriminating in price when selling to dispensaries, craft growers, or infuser organizations. License awards will likely be delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and legal actions taken by applicants. 
The IL Act imposes several operational requirements on adult-use licensees and requires prospective licensees to demonstrate their plans to comply with such requirements. For example, applicants for dispensary licenses must include an employee training plan, a security plan, recordkeeping and inventory plans, a quality control plan and an operating plan. 
Licensees must establish methods for identifying, recording, and reporting diversion, theft, or loss, correcting inventory errors, and complying with product recalls. Licensees also must comply with detailed 
inventory, storage, and security requirements. Cultivation licenses are subject to similar operational requirements, such as complying with detailed security and storage requirements, and must also establish plans to address energy, water, and waste-management needs. Dispensary licenses will be renewed bi-annually, and cultivation licenses, craft grower licenses, infuser organization licenses, and transporter licenses will be renewed annually. 
Illinois Licenses
Illinois licenses four types of cannabis businesses within the state: (1) cultivation; (2) processing; (3) transportation; and (4) dispensary. All cultivation, craft growers, infusers, and transporting establishments must register with the Illinois Department of Agriculture. All dispensaries must register with the IDFPR. If applications contain all required information, establishments are issued a cannabis establishment registration certificate. Registration certificates are valid for a period of one year and are subject to strict annual renewal requirements.
HealthCentral LLC has been issued a total of six dispensary licenses, two medical licenses and four adult use licenses. Revolution Cannabis-Barry LLC has been issued two cultivation licenses, one medical license and one adult use license, and one transporter license. MOCA LLC is licensed to operate two dispensaries and has been issued a total of three dispensary licenses, one medical and two adult use licenses. Chicago Alternative Health Center, LLC is licensed and operates two dispensaries, one in Chicago and one in Chicago Ridge and has been issued a total of three dispensary licenses, one medical and two adult use licenses.

Illinois Storage and Security
Both our cultivation center and our dispensaries are required to store cannabis in restricted-access areas. Our dispensaries must store inventory on-site in a secured and restricted-access area and enter information into Illinois’ tracking system as required by law and IDFPR rules. Any cannabis or cannabis products in an open or defective package, which have expired, or which the company otherwise has reason to believe have been opened or tampered with must be segregated in secure storage until promptly and properly disposed of. 
Dispensaries are also required to implement security measures designed to deter and prevent unauthorized entry into the facility (and restricted-access areas) and theft, loss or diversion of cannabis or cannabis products. In this respect, dispensaries must maintain a commercial grade alarm and surveillance system installed by an Illinois licensed private alarm contractor or private alarm contractor agency. Dispensaries must also implement various security measures designed to protect the premises, customers and dispensing organization agents (employees). 
Illinois Reporting Requirements
Illinois uses BioTrack THC as its track and trace (“T&T”) system. All dispensing organization licensees are required to use a real-time, web-based inventory tracking/point-of-sale system that is accessible to IDFPR at any time, and at a minimum, tracks the date of sale, amount, price, and currency. We use BioTrack THC for inventory management and LeafLogix as a point-of-sale system. Licensees are also required to track each sales transaction at the time of the sale, daily beginning and ending inventory, acquisitions (including information about the supplier and the product) and disposal.
Illinois Transportation Requirements
Currently, licensed cultivation centers may transport cannabis and cannabis products in accordance with certain guidelines. For receiving products, dispensing organizations must receive a copy of the shipping manifest prepared by the cultivation center in advance of transport and is required to check the product delivered against such manifest at the time of delivery. All cannabis and cannabis products must be packaged in properly labeled and sealed containers. Dispensaries may not accept products that are mislabeled, products that have labels missing or when packaging is opened or tampered with.
U.S. Attorney Statements in Illinois
To the knowledge of management, other than as disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there have not been any statements or guidance made by federal authorities or prosecutors regarding the risk of enforcement action in Illinois. See “Risk Factors - U.S. state regulation of cannabis is uncertain.”
Maryland
Maryland Regulatory Landscape
In 2012, a state law was enacted in Maryland to establish a state-regulated medical cannabis program. Legislation was signed in May 2013 and the program became operational on December 1, 2017. The Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission (“MMCC”) regulates the state program and awarded operational licenses in a competitive application process. 102 licenses were awarded out of a pool of 800 applicants, while an original 15 cultivation licenses were awarded out of a pool of nearly 150 applications. In April 2018, Maryland lawmakers agreed to expand the state’s medical cannabis industry by authorizing an additional 20 licenses, seven for cultivation and 13 for processing. The state program was written to allow access to medical cannabis for patients with any condition that is considered “severe” for which other medical treatments have proven ineffective, including: chronic pain, nausea, seizures, glaucoma, and PTSD. 
There are three principal license categories in Maryland: (1) cultivation, (2) processing, and (3) dispensary. All grower, processor, and dispensary establishments must register with the MMCC under the provisions of the Maryland Medical Cannabis Law, Md. Code, Health-Gen § 13-3301 et seq., known as the Natalie M. LaPrade Medical Cannabis Commission.
All cultivation, processing and dispensary establishments must register with the MMCC under the provisions of the Maryland Medical Cannabis Law, Section 13-3301 et seq. If applications contain all required information, establishments are issued a medical cannabis establishment registration certificate. Registration certificates are valid for a period of six years and are subject to annual renewals after required fees are paid and the business remains in good standing. After the first expiration of the approved license, the dispensary, cultivation and processing licensee is required to renew every four years. Licensees are required to submit a renewal application per the guidelines published by the MMCC. 90 days prior to the expiration of a license, the MMCC notifies the licensee of the date on which the license expires and provides the instructions and fee required to renew the license along with the consequences of failure to renew. At least 30 business days before a license expires, the licensee must submit the renewal application as provided by the MMCC.
The medical cultivation licenses permit a licensee to acquire, possess, cultivate, deliver, transfer, have tested, transport, supply or sell cannabis and related supplies to medical cannabis dispensaries, facilities for the production of medical cannabis products and/or medical cannabis-infused products or other medical cannabis cultivation facilities.
The medical processing license permits the licensee to acquire, possess, manufacture, deliver, transfer, transport, supply, or sell cannabis products or cannabis infused products to other medical cannabis production facilities or medical cannabis dispensaries
The retail dispensary licenses permit the licensee to purchase cannabis from cultivation facilities, cannabis and cannabis products from product manufacturing facilities and cannabis from other medical cannabis dispensaries, as well as allow the sale of cannabis and cannabis products.
In November of 2022, voters in Maryland approved a constitutional amendment to legalize cannabis for adults 21 and older, by July 1, 2023. On February 3, 2023, the Maryland General Assembly filed a bill to tax and regulate cannabis, which would create a tax and legal structure to govern cannabis sales and adult use upon the legalization date of July 1, 2023. The bill has yet to be signed and the specific requirements of the bill are still being negotiated. 
Maryland Licenses
 On January 25, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement (the “Maryland Agreement”) to acquire 100% of the membership interests of Devi Holdings, Inc. (“Devi”), which owns and operates four licensed medical cannabis dispensaries in Maryland. Under the Maryland Agreement, we will also acquire the real property of the four dispensary locations. The Maryland Agreement is subject to regulatory review and approval.
The below table lists the Maryland licenses held by Devi: 

Entity | License Number | City | Expiration Date /Renewal Date | Description 
Blue Mountain Care LLC | D-18-00029 | Aberdeen | 6/28/2024 | Medical License

Blue Pharms, LLC | D- 19-00003 | Laurel | 3/28/2025 | Medical License

Maryland Recordkeeping and Inventory Requirements
Licensed growers are required to use a perpetual inventory system that identifies and tracks each lot of medical cannabis from the time of propagation to the time it is delivered to a licensed dispensary and dispensed to a qualified patient. The perpetual inventory system is required to be capable of tracking cannabis back to its original source and to promptly identify discrepancies. Each plant within the perpetual inventory system is required to be 
assigned a unique identifier that is traceable through the entire production and dispensing lifecycle. Licensees are required to investigate discrepancies identified by the perpetual inventory system and to report such discrepancies to the MMCC and Maryland State Police where the licensee finds evidence of theft or diversion.
Licensed growers, processors, and dispensaries are required to retain, independent of the required inventory control system, a searchable, secure, tamper-evident record of distribution regarding the names and addresses of recipients, the quantity provided, and the name, strength, batch number and lot number of the product provided. Such records must be available to certifying providers upon request. Licensees are also required to retain records of production and distribution of each batch and lot and of daily checklists to maintain uniformity from batch to batch, as well as a log of all visitors to licensed premises. Records must be kept in duplicate at a secure off-site location.
Maryland Dispensary Requirements
In order to dispense medical cannabis, a licensed dispensary is required to comply with various dispensing requirements: (1) require presentment of a written certification from a qualifying patient or caregiver, (2) query the MMCC’s data network to verify that the patient is currently registered and has a certification from a provider, as well as the amount of medical cannabis that has already been dispensed pursuant to the written certification,(3) dispense no more than a 30-day supply, and (4) decline to dispense medical cannabis if the patient or caregiver appears to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Registered patients and caregivers are required to provide attestations relating to their knowledge of the status of medical cannabis under Maryland and Federal law, as well as limitations on the use of medical cannabis, such as keeping away from children and refraining from transfer to any other person.
Maryland Storage and Security
Licensees are required to take measures to ensure the safety and security of licensed premises such as: (1) constructing the premises so as to prevent unauthorized entry, (2) constructing secure rooms for the storage of cannabis that are not along the exterior wall of a facility and that have access-controlled entry, (3) utilizing exterior lighting fixtures to ensure proper surveillance, (4) installing security alarms covering perimeter entry points, which shall be continuously monitored, (5) installing separate alarm systems to protect on-site and off-site record storage areas, as well as areas used for cannabis storage, and (6) utilizing motion-activated video surveillance that covers entrances and exits to a facility, as well as any area that cannabis is packaged, tested, processed, stored, or dispensed.
Maryland Reporting Requirements
The State of Maryland uses METRC as the state’s computerized seed-to-sale tracking system. Individual licensees, whether directly or through third-party integration systems, are required to push data to the state to meet all reporting requirements. 
MMCC Inspections
Licensees are required to submit to announced and unannounced inspections by the MMCC, including but not limited to inspections based upon an allegation of noncompliance.
U.S. Attorney Statements in Maryland
To the knowledge of management, other than as disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there have not been any statements or guidance made by federal authorities or prosecutors regarding the risk of enforcement action in Maryland. See “Risk Factors - U.S. state regulation of cannabis is uncertain.
Massachusetts
Massachusetts Regulatory Landscape
The Massachusetts Medical Use of Marijuana Program (the “MA Program”) was formed pursuant to the Act for the Humanitarian Medical Use of Marijuana (the “MA ACT”). The MA Program allows registered persons to purchase medical cannabis and applies to any patient, personal caregiver, Medical Marijuana Treatment Center (each, a “MTC”), and MTC agent that qualifies and registers under the MA Program. To qualify, patients must suffer from a debilitating condition as defined by the MA Program. Currently there are eight conditions that allow a patient to acquire cannabis in Massachusetts, including AIDS/HIV, ALS, cancer and Crohn’s disease. As of May 31, 2019, approximately 59,000 patients have been registered to purchase medical cannabis products in Massachusetts. The MA Program is administrated by the Cannabis Control Commission of Massachusetts (the “CCC”). As of March 7, 2023, there were approximately 181 open MTCs in Massachusetts.
In November 2016, Massachusetts voted affirmatively on a ballot petition to legalize and regulate cannabis for adult-use. The Massachusetts legislature amended the law on December 28, 2016, delaying the date adult-use cannabis sales would begin by six months. The delay allowed the legislature to clarify how municipal land-use regulations would treat the cultivation of cannabis and authorized a study of related issues. After further debate, the state House of Representatives and state Senate approved H.3818 which became Chapter 55 of the Acts of 2017, An Act to Ensure Safe Access to Marijuana, and established the CCC. The CCC consists of five commissioners and regulates both the Adult Use and Medical Use of Marijuana programs. Sales of adult-use cannabis in Massachusetts started in July 2018. Adult-use cannabis in Massachusetts is regulated under M.G.L. ch. 94G and 935 CMR 500 et seq.
Under the MA Program, MTCs are heavily regulated. Vertically integrated MTCs grow, process, and dispense their own cannabis. As such, each MTC is required to have a retail facility as well as cultivation and processing operations, although retail operations may be separate from grow and cultivation operations. An MTC’s cultivation location may be in a different municipality or county than its retail facility.
The MA Program mandates a comprehensive application process for MTCs. Each Registered Marijuana Dispensary (each, a “RMD”) applicant must submit a Certificate of Good Standing from the Massachusetts Department of Revenue, comprehensive financial statements, a character and competency form, and employment and education histories of the senior partners and individuals responsible for the day-to-day security and operation of the MTC. Municipalities may individually determine what local permits or licenses are required if an MTC wishes to establish an operation within its boundaries.
Massachusetts Licenses
MassGrow LLC has been issued one cultivation and one provisional manufacturing processing license and Ascend Mass LLC has been issued one retail license and two provisional retail licenses. 
The below table lists our Massachusetts licenses:

Entity | License Number | City | Expiration Date /Renewal Date | Description 
MassGrow, LLC | MC281488 | Athol | 8/12/2023 | Adult Use Cultivation License 
MassGrow, LLC | MP281460 | Athol | 8/12/2023 | Manufacturing Processing License
Ascend Mass, LLC | MR282077 | Boston | 2/9/2024 | Adult Use License 
Ascend Mass, LLC | MR282837 | Newton | 6/10/2023 | Adult Use License 
Southcoast Apothecary LLC | MR283075 | New Bedford | 8/11/2023 | Adult Use License 

Each Massachusetts dispensary, grower and processor license is valid for one year and must be renewed no later than 60 calendar days prior to expiration. As in other states where cannabis is legal, the CCC can deny licenses and renewals for multiple reasons, including (per 935 CMR 500.400) (1) failure to complete the application process within the required time period; (2) submission of deceptive, misleading, or fraudulent information, (3) an indication of an inability to maintain and operate a compliant cannabis establishment, (4) determination of unsuitability pursuant to, for example, certain criminal convictions, (5) failure to comply with cannabis license control limitations, (6) rejection of revocation of another cannabis license in Massachusetts or elsewhere; or (7) any other ground that serves the purposes of the law. Revocations can also be based on (per 935 CMR 500.450) (1) failure to submit or implement a plan of correction; (2) attempting to assign ownership to another entity or making other significant changes without proper permission, (3) lack of responsible operation of a cannabis establishment, (4) maintaining a substandard level of compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, (5) financial insolvency; (6) failure to cooperate with law enforcement, (7) violation of the safety, health, or welfare of the public; or (8) committing, permitting, aiding, or abetting of any illegal practices in the operation of the cannabis establishment. Additionally, license holders must ensure that no cannabis is sold, delivered, or distributed by a producer from or to a location outside of the state. 
Regulation of the Adult-Use Cannabis Market in Massachusetts
Adult-use cannabis has been legal in Massachusetts since December 15, 2016, following a ballot initiative in November of that year. The CCC, a regulatory body created in 2018, licenses adult-use cultivation, processing and dispensary facilities (collectively, “Marijuana Establishments” or “MEs”) pursuant to 935 CMR 500.000 et seq. The first adult-use cannabis facilities in Massachusetts began operating in November 2018.
Massachusetts Licensing Requirements (Adult-Use)
Applicants must submit proof of being an entity registered to do business in Massachusetts, as well as a list of all people and entities having direct or indirect control of the business, documentation of any such people or entities’ other business interests, details of the amounts and sources of capital resources, and documentation of a bond or escrow account. Furthermore, the applicant must provide a specific address for the location of the establishment, proof of a property interest in that address, documentation that the applicant has a “host community agreement” with the municipality, and documentation that the applicant has held at least one community outreach meeting. The applicant must also provide a description of plans to ensure that the cannabis establishment will be compliant with all applicable laws and regulations, and also a specific plan to positively impact areas of disproportionate impact (geographical locations in the state which have had historically high rates of arrest, conviction, and incarceration related to cannabis crimes). The application also requires payment of a fee. 
All individuals identified as having direct or indirect control in the license must undergo an extensive background check that includes criminal, civil, and regulatory records; certain criminal convictions, civil actions, or regulatory infractions may trigger a finding of unsuitability
Each license applicant must submit detailed information about its business registration, certificates of good standing, and a plan to obtain liability insurance. The application must include a detailed business plan, a detailed summary of operating policies and procedures addressing issues like security, storage, prevention of diversion, transportation, inventory practices, recordkeeping, and a specific diversity plan demonstrating promotion of equity among people of color, women, veterans, persons with disabilities, and LGBTQ+ individuals. Such plans must have specific goals and measurable outcomes that will be monitored and updated through the entire existence of the cannabis establishment. 
Pursuant to 935 CMR 500.050, no person or entity may own or have direct or indirect control over more than three licenses in each Marijuana Establishment category (i.e., cannabis retailer, cannabis cultivator, cannabis product manufacturer). Additionally, there is a 100,000 square foot cultivation canopy restriction for adult-use licenses.
Massachusetts Dispensary Requirements (Adult-Use)
Cannabis retailers may purchase, transport, sell, repackage, or otherwise transfer cannabis and cannabis products to consumers. On-site consumption is prohibited. All permitted cannabis-related activities must take place solely at the licensed address. 
All cannabis establishment employees must receive at least eight hours of training annually. A total of four hours of training shall be from Responsible Vendor Training Program courses established under 935 CMR 500.105(2)(b). The remaining four hours may be conducted in-house by the cannabis establishment as on-the-job training. 
All cannabis establishments must have written operating procedures addressing security measures, employee security policies, descriptions of operating hours and after-hours contact information, storage and waste disposal, product descriptions, price list, recordkeeping, quality control, staffing, emergency procedures, alcohol/smoke/drug-free workplace policies, confidential information handling, plans for immediate dismissal of employees who divert cannabis, engage in unsafe practices or are convicted of certain crimes, board of directors and members list, cash handling, prevention of diversion, energy efficiency, and workplace safety. Retail establishments must also have plans to check the identification of each customer both upon entering the store and again at the point of sale. No one under 21 is permitted to purchase cannabis or to be on the premises. Retail stores must ensure that customers purchase no more than one ounce of cannabis (or its equivalent in other forms) per day. Retailers also have the right to refuse sales to customers, for example, those that appear to be impaired by the influence of substances. 
The retail point of sale system must be approved by both the CCC and the state Department of Revenue. It must be integrated with Metrc, the state’s seed-to-sale tracking system. The system must also be audited on a monthly basis to ensure that no additional software has been installed that could alter sales data. 
Cannabis retailers must have available extensive consumer education materials, including in languages other than English. 
Massachusetts Security and Storage Requirements (Adult-Use)
Each Marijuana Establishment must implement sufficient safety measures to deter and prevent unauthorized entrance into areas containing cannabis and theft of cannabis at the establishment. Security measures taken by the establishments to protect the premises, employees, consumers and general public must include, but not be limited to, the following:
•positively identifying individuals seeking access to the premises of the Cannabis Establishment or to whom or cannabis products are being transported pursuant to 935 CMR 500.105(13) to limit access solely to individuals 21 years of age or older;
•adopting procedures to prevent loitering and ensure that only individuals engaging in activity expressly or by necessary implication permitted by the regulations and its enabling statute are allowed to remain on the premises;

•storing all finished cannabis products in a secure, locked safe or vault in such a manner as to prevent diversion, theft and loss;
•keeping all safes, vaults, and any other equipment or areas used for the production, cultivation, harvesting, processing or storage of cannabis products securely locked and protected from entry, except for the actual time required to remove or replace cannabis;
•keeping all locks and security equipment in good working order;
•prohibiting keys, if any, from being left in the locks or stored or placed in a location accessible to persons other than specifically authorized personnel;
•prohibiting accessibility of security measures, such as combination numbers, passwords or electronic or biometric security systems, to persons other than specifically authorized personnel;
•ensuring that the outside perimeter of the Marijuana Establishment is sufficiently lit to facilitate surveillance, where applicable;
•ensuring that all cannabis products are kept out of plain sight and are not visible from a public place without the use of binoculars, optical aids or aircraft;
•developing emergency policies and procedures for securing all product following any instance of diversion, theft or loss of cannabis, and conduct an assessment to determine whether additional safeguards are necessary;
•developing sufficient additional safeguards as required by the CCC for Marijuana Establishments that present special security concerns; 
•establishing procedures for safe cash handling and cash transportation to financial institutions to prevent theft, loss and associated risks to the safety of employees, customers and the general public;
•sharing the establishment’s floor layout with law enforcement and as required by the municipality to identify the use of any flammable or combustible solvents, chemicals, or other such materials in use; and
•sharing the Marijuana Establishment’s security plan and procedures with law enforcement authorities and fire services and periodically updating law enforcement authorities and fire services if the plans or procedures are modified in a material way.
Cannabis must be stored in special limited access areas, and alarm systems must meet certain technical requirements, including a failure notification system, perimeter alarms on all entry and exit points, duress/panic alarms, and video surveillance in all areas where cannabis or cash is kept and at all points of entry and exit. The surveillance system must have the ability to record footage 24 hours a day and to retain such footage for at least 90 days. The systems must be angled so as to allow for the capture of clear identification of any person entering or existing the establishment and must be able to remain operational for a minimum of four hours in the event of a power outage. Regular audits are required every 30 days.
Massachusetts Transportation Requirements (Adult-Use)
Cannabis products may only be transported between licensed MEs by registered Marijuana Establishment agents. A licensed cannabis transporter may contract with a licensed Marijuana Establishment to transport that licensee’s cannabis products to other licensed establishments. The originating and receiving licensed establishments shall ensure that all transported cannabis products are linked to METRC, Massachusetts’ seed-to-sale tracking program. For the purposes of tracking, seeds and clones will be properly tracked and labeled in a form and manner determined by the CCC. Any cannabis product that is undeliverable or is refused by the destination Marijuana Establishment shall be transported back to the originating establishment. All vehicles transporting cannabis products shall be staffed with a minimum of two Marijuana Establishment agents. At least one agent shall remain with the vehicle at all times that the vehicle contains cannabis or cannabis products. Prior to the products leaving a Marijuana Establishment for the purpose of transporting cannabis products, the originating Marijuana Establishment must weigh, inventory, and account for, on video, all cannabis products to be transported. Within eight hours after arrival at the destination Marijuana Establishment, the destination establishment must re-weigh, re-inventory, and account for, on video, all cannabis products transported. When videotaping the weighing, inventorying, and accounting of cannabis products before transportation or after receipt, the video must show each product being weighed, the weight, and the manifest. Cannabis products must be packaged in sealed, labeled, and tamper or child-resistant packaging prior to and during transportation. In the case of an emergency stop during the transportation of cannabis products, a log must be maintained describing the reason for the stop, the duration, the location, and any activities of personnel exiting the vehicle. A Marijuana Establishment or a cannabis transporter transporting cannabis products is required to ensure that all transportation times and routes are randomized. An establishment or transporter transporting cannabis products shall ensure that all transport routes remain within Massachusetts. All vehicles and transportation equipment used in the transportation of cannabis products or edibles requiring temperature control for 
safety must be designed, maintained, and equipped as necessary to provide adequate temperature control to prevent the cannabis products or edibles from becoming unsafe during transportation, consistent with applicable requirements pursuant to 21 CFR 1.908(c).
Vehicles used for transport must be owned or leased by the Marijuana Establishment or transporter, and they must be properly registered, inspected, and insured in Massachusetts All vehicles must be equipped with a video system that includes at least one camera in the storage area and at least one camera in the driver area.

Cannabis may not be visible from outside the vehicle, and it must be transported in a secure, locked storage compartment. The vehicle may not have any external markings indicating that it is used to transport cannabis. Each vehicle must have a global positioning system, and any agent transporting cannabis must have access to a secure form of communication with the originating location. Firearms are forbidden inside the vehicle or on the person of an agent. Each transport must have a manifest filled out in triplicate.
Massachusetts CCC Inspections
The CCC or its agents may inspect a Marijuana Establishment and affiliated vehicles at any time without prior notice in order to determine compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. All areas of a Marijuana Establishment, all Marijuana Establishment agents and activities, and all records are subject to such inspection. Marijuana establishments must immediately upon request make available to the CCC all information that may be relevant to a CCC inspection, or an investigation of any incident or complaint. A Marijuana Establishment must make all reasonable efforts to facilitate the CCC’s inspection, or investigation of any incident or complaint, including the taking of samples, photographs, video or other recordings by the CCC or its agents, and to facilitate the CCC’s interviews of Marijuana Establishment agents. During an inspection, the CCC may direct a Marijuana Establishment to test cannabis for contaminants as specified by the CCC, including but not limited to mold, mildew, heavy metals, plant-growth regulators, and the presence of pesticides not approved for use on cannabis by the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources.

U.S. Attorney Statements in Massachusetts
On July 10, 2018, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, Andrew Lelling, issued a statement regarding the legalization of adult-use cannabis in Massachusetts. Mr. Lelling stated that since he has a constitutional obligation to enforce the laws passed by Congress, he would not immunize the residents of Massachusetts from federal law enforcement. He did state, however, that his office’s resources would be primarily focused on combating the opioid epidemic. He stated that considering those factors and the experiences of other states that have legalized adult-use cannabis, his office’s enforcement efforts would focus on the areas of (i) overproduction, (ii) targeted sales to minors, and (iii) organized crime and interstate transportation of drug proceeds. 
To the knowledge of management, other than as disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there have not been any statements or guidance made by federal authorities or prosecutors regarding the risk of enforcement action in Massachusetts. See “Risk Factors - U.S. state regulation of cannabis is uncertain.”
Michigan
Michigan Regulatory Landscape
In 2008, the Michigan Compassionate Care Initiative established a medical cannabis program for serious and terminally ill patients. This program, which was approved by the House but not acted upon and defaulted to a public initiative on the November ballot. Proposal 1 was approved by 63% of voters on November 8, 2008. Proposal 1 was then written into law and approved by Michigan’s lawmakers in December 2008. The resulting Act became the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act (“MMMA”). The MMMA provides access to state residents to cannabis and 
cannabis related products under one of 11 debilitating conditions, including epilepsy, cancer, HIV/AIDS, cancer and post-traumatic stress disorder. In July 2018, the Medical Marihuana Review Panel approved 11 additional conditions to the list of aliments to qualify for medical cannabis. The additional 11 include chronic pain, colitis and spinal cord injury.
In 2016, the Michigan legislature passed two new acts and also amended the original MMMA. The first act, the Medical Marihuana Facilities Licensing Act (“MMFLA”), effective December 20, 2016 and most recently amended effective December 7, 2021, establishes a licensing and regulation framework for medical cannabis growers, processors, secure transporters, provisioning centers, and safety compliance facilities. The second act, the Marihuana Tracking Act (“MTA”), establishes a “seed-to-sale” system to track cannabis that is grown, processed, transferred, stored, or disposed of under the MMFLA.
In November of 2018 Michigan voters, through another public ballot initiative approved the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act (“MRTMA”) legalizing and establishing a licensing and regulatory framework for adult-use growers, processors, secure transporters, retailers, microbusinesses, event organizers, designated consumption establishments, and safety compliance facilities. The proposal was approved by nearly 56% of the voters. The state began taking applications for such on November, 1, 2019 and the first sales of adult-use marihuana took place on December 1, 2019. According to the Cowen report, Charting Cannabis: A U.S. State Level Deep Dive, published February 19, 2020, there were 125 open dispensaries in Michigan as of the end of 2019.
The Marihuana Regulatory Agency (“MRA”) is a separate agency within the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs and is responsible for the oversight of cannabis in Michigan. The MRA consists of the Medical and Adult Marihuana Applications, Compliance, Scientific & Legal and Enforcement Divisions and the Michigan Medical Marihuana Program Division. The MRA is responsible for issuing cards to medical cannabis patients, and oversight and licensing of medical facilities and adult-use establishments.
The MRA and State of Michigan attempted to combine the medical and adult-use markets during the 2019-2020 legislative session, but the proposed bill did not receive a vote in both legislative bodies. However, while the MMFLA and MRTMA remain separate and distinct laws, the MRA adopted topic-based Administrative Rules in June 2020 which address both medical facilities and adult-use establishments. 
On September 27, 2021, the MRA held a public hearing to receive comments on updated Administrative Rules that are intended to provide clarity and consistency to licensees in both the medical and adult-use markets. Final drafts of the amended Administrative Rules were published in January 2022. On March 7, 2022, the updated Administrative Rules went into effect.
Under both the MMFLA and MRTMA Michigan municipalities can choose if they will allow cannabis establishments or facilities, and the type and number of establishments or facilities within their jurisdiction. This includes licensing and zoning ordinances for many municipalities. Because each municipality is able to devise a unique set of rules for cannabis licenses, each facility or establishment in a different Michigan municipality may be subject to a different set of local ordinances.

Michigan Storage and Security Requirements
Michigan licensees must meet the security requirements as set forth in the MRTMA, MMFLA and Administrative Rules. As such, licensees are required to include a security plan in their state license applications. The plan and required security measures include, but are not limited to, ensuring that visitors are escorted by an employee at all times; maintaining commercial locks or electronic access on all doors and windows; having an active alarm system for the premises; having a video surveillance system that records all areas where marihuana products are weighed, packed, stored, loaded, and unloaded for transportation, prepared, or moved; recording the access point to the surveillance system; recording the exterior and interior of entrances and exits; recording all areas within 20 feet of entrances and exits; recording in 720p resolution or higher; ensuring sufficient lighting for recording; maintaining recordings for at least 30 days and a log of all those with access to the surveillance system. All marihuana products must be stored in a secured limited or restricted access area on the licensed premises. General requirements for all cannabis business can be found in Michigan Administrative Rule 420.206.
Michigan Transportation Requirements
Except in limited circumstances, transportation of cannabis between licensees takes place via State licensed secure transporters. Transported products are entered into a manifest and the Michigan statewide monitoring system. Products are picked up from cultivators and processors by secure transporters and then delivered to destinations. For adult use products licensed transporters may also transfer products between our retail locations. A transporter must transport all cannabis products in a locked, secured, and sealed container that is not accessible while in transit. The container must be secured by a locked closed lid or door. Cannabis product must be labeled and kept in separate compartments or containers within the main locked, secured, and sealed container. If the transporter transports money associated with the purchase or sale of cannabis product between businesses, the transporter shall lock the money in a sealed container kept separate from the cannabis product and only accessible to the licensee and its employees. A transporter cannot maintain custody of the cannabis product for more than 96 hours without permission from the MRA.
Michigan Reporting Requirements
Michigan licensees must maintain on-site, or have electronic access to, all records of the establishment. Records are defined as books, ledgers, documents, writings, photocopies, correspondence, electronic storage media, electronically stored records, money receptacles, equipment in which records are stored, including data or information in the statewide monitoring system, or any other document that is used for recording information. Additionally, licensees must provide the state with an audited annual financial statements every three years, or a shorter period as may be determined by the MRA. This report must be conducted by an independent certified public accountant and includes information including but not limited to: sampling of all transaction done by the organization over the course of the year; employees and employment; bank accounts; management, revenues, METRC transactions, vendors, taxes, ownership and distributions, outsourcing, licensing agreements, and independent contractors. Additionally, licensees must report any change to operations, officers, owners, members, managers, applicants; changes in processing machinery or equipment, violations or local ordinances, changes in named applicant; changes in names; conveyances of interest in a license; modifications to businesses or business plans between inspections or submissions; changes in capacities; changes to ingress or egress; adverse reactions to marihuana products; criminal convictions, charges, civil judgements, lawsuits, legal proceedings, charges, or governmental investigations; employee discipline for misconduct related to product sales or transfers; diversion; theft; and any suspected criminal activity on the premises. The above issues, depending on the type, must be reported either before the change, within 24 hours thereof or within 10 days of notice thereof.
Michigan Site-Visits and Inspections
The MRA or its agents may inspect a licensee at any time without prior notice in order to determine compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. All areas of the licensed premises, all licensee employees, agents, and activities, and all records are subject to such inspection. Licensees must immediately upon request make available to the MRA all information that may be relevant to a MRA inspection, or an investigation of any incident or complaint. 
MRA agents conduct initial pre-licensure inspections, a post-licensure inspection within 30 days of operation, and then semi-annual inspections thereafter. The Michigan Bureau of Fire Services also conducts fire safety plan reviews, initial pre-licensure and semi-annual inspections of licensees.
U.S. Attorney Statements in Michigan
On November 8, 2018, United States Attorneys Matthew Schneider and Andrew Birge for the Eastern and Western Districts of Michigan, respectively, issued a joint statement regarding the legalization of adult-use cannabis in Michigan. They stated that since they had taken oaths to protect and defend the Constitution and the laws of the United States, they would not immunize the residents of Michigan from federal law enforcement. They stated that they would continue to the investigation and prosecution of cannabis crimes as they do with any other crime. They stated they would consider the federal law enforcement priorities set by the DOJ, the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of prosecution, and the cumulative impact of the crime on a community, while also considering their ability to prosecute with limited resources. They stated that combating illegal drugs was just one of many priorities, 
and that even within the area of drugs, they were focused on combating the opioid epidemic. They stated that they have not focused on prosecution of low-level offenders, which they stated would not change (unless aggravating factors were present). They did state that certain crimes involving cannabis could pose serious risks and harm to a community, including interstate trafficking, involvement of other illegal drugs or activity, persons with criminal records, presence of firearms or violence, criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels, bypassing local laws and regulations, potential for environmental contamination, risks to minors, and cultivation on federal property. On December 21, 2021, Dawn N. Ison was appointed as United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan. 
To the knowledge of management, other than as disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there have not been any statements or guidance made by federal authorities or prosecutors regarding the risk of enforcement action in Michigan. See “Risk Factors - U.S. state regulation of cannabis is uncertain.”
New Jersey
New Jersey Regulatory Landscape
New Jersey’s medical cannabis program was introduced in January 2010 when then Governor Corzine signed the New Jersey Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act into law which legalized medical cannabis for patients with certain enumerated qualifying conditions. Medical cannabis sales began in December 2012 and as of the first quarter of 2021, there were 10 licensed and operational Adult Treatment Centers (“ATCs”) dispensing medical cannabis to patients. However, the state has accepted applications for satellite dispensaries for those operators, and we expect additional locations to open by the end of calendar year 2021. According to the Cowen report, Charting Cannabis: A U.S. State Level Deep Dive, published February 19, 2020, there were six open medical dispensaries in New Jersey as of the end of 2019.
In March 2018, under the direction of Governor Phil Murphy, who campaigned on a platform that included cannabis legalization, the New Jersey Department of Health (“NJ DOH”) issued the Executive Order 6 Report, which immediately expanded the medical cannabis program in numerous ways including adding chronic pain and anxiety as qualifying conditions, doubling the monthly product limit, and permitting current licensees to open satellite dispensaries. In August 2018, the NJ DOH began accepting applications for the licensing of six additional ATCs, and those licenses were awarded in December 2018. In August 2019, the NJ DOH accepted applications for the licensing of 24 additional ATCs, divvied among three regions (northern, central, southern) and three forms of endorsements (cultivation, dispensary, vertically integrated).
ATC licenses are awarded by a selection committee that evaluates applicants on the following general criteria: (1) submittal of mandatory organizational information; (2) ability to meet the overall health needs of qualified patients and safety of the public; (3) history of compliance with regulations and policies governing government-regulated cannabis programs; (4) ability and experience of applicant in ensuring an adequate supply of cannabis; (5) community support and participation; (6) ability to provide appropriate research data; (7) experience in cultivating, manufacturing, or dispensing cannabis in compliance with government-regulated cannabis programs; and (8) workforce and job creation plan. Information required to be submitted is wide-ranging, and includes identification information and background checks of principals, employees, directors, and other stakeholders, and evidence of compliance with certain state and local laws and ordinances.
ATCs are subject to a detailed regulatory scheme encompassing security, staffing, point-of-sale systems, manufacturing standards, hours of operation, delivery, advertising and marketing, product labeling, records and reporting, and more. As with all jurisdictions, the full regulations (N.J.A.C. 8:64 et seq.) should be consulted for further information about any particular operational area. For example (and not by limitation), ATCs are subject to a number of regulations regarding their policies, procedures, records, and reporting. For example, ATCs must develop oversight procedures; procedures to ensure safe growing and dispensing operations; security policies; inventory protocols; disaster plans; pricing standards; and crime prevention plans and must maintain careful records, including organizational charts; facility documents; supply-and-demand projections; general business records; detailed sales records; and detailed personnel and training records. ATCs must provide substantial training for their employees and must maintain an alcohol and drug-free workplace.
Licenses are renewed annually, and applications therefore must be submitted 60-days prior to expiration of the license then in force and effect. Provided that the requisite renewal fees are paid, the renewal application is submitted in a timely manner, and there are no material violations associated with the license, license holders can expect to receive a renewal in the ordinary course of business.
On November 3, 2020, voters in New Jersey approved an amendment to the state’s constitution to legalize cannabis for adult use in New Jersey. On February 22, 2021, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy signed into law three bills which, taken together, give effect to the amendment and decriminalize small amounts of cannabis possession in New Jersey. The Cannabis Regulatory Commission (“CRC”) was created to establish rules and regulations governing the sale and purchase of adult-use cannabis, to administer the state’s medicinal cannabis program, and to oversee licensing for all areas of the cannabis industry. On August 19, 2021, the CRC voted to adopt initial rules regulating the adult-use cannabis market, Special Adopted New Rules: N.J.A.C. 17:30. In December of 2021, license applications opened for adult-use cultivators, manufacturers, and testing laboratories. In March of 2022, license applications opened for adult-use dispensaries and the first conditional recreation business applications were approved. On April 21, 2022 the first adult-use sales began. There is no established limit on the number of cannabis business licenses available statewide. On February 8, 2023, the CRC took action to promote the continued development of New Jersey’s cannabis industry and improve the licensing process. As of February 23, 2023, cannabis license holders will be able to concurrently hold a cultivator license, a manufacturer license, a retailer license, and a delivery service license. Additionally, wholesale license holders can also hold a distributor license. Expanded ATCs may cultivate, manufacture, retail, and deliver.

New Jersey Storage and Security Requirements
All ATCs and adult use cannabis businesses are required to provide effective controls and procedures to guard against theft and diversion of cannabis including, when appropriate, systems to protect against electronic records tampering. With respect to security and inventory protocols, ATCs and adult use cannabis businesses are required to maintain security and alarm systems in good working order; test and inspect such security systems; employ policies to limit unauthorized access to areas containing cannabis; adopt security protocols to protect personnel; minimize exterior access and ensure the exterior of the facility has adequate lighting; and notify the proper authorities of reportable losses, security breaches, alarm activations, and electrical failures.
Further, all ATCs and adult use cannabis businesses must install, maintain in good working order and operate a safety and security alarm system at its authorized physical address(es) that will provide suitable protection 24 hours a day, seven days a week against theft and diversion and that provides, at a minimum: (i) immediate automatic or electronic notification to alert state or local police agencies to an unauthorized breach of security at the ATC or adult use cannabis business; and (ii) a backup system that activates immediately and automatically upon a loss of electrical support and that immediately issues either automatically or electronic notification to state or local police agencies of the loss of electrical support. ATCs and adult use cannabis businesses must also implement appropriate security and safety measures to deter and prevent the unauthorized entrance into areas containing cannabis and the theft of cannabis and security measures that protect the premises, registered qualifying patients, registered primary caregivers and principal officers, directors, board members and employees of the ATC and adult use cannabis business. Each ATC and adult use cannabis business must establish a protocol for testing and maintenance of the security alarm system and conduct maintenance inspections and tests of the security alarm system at the ATC's and adult use cannabis business’ authorized location at intervals not to exceed 30 days from the previous inspection and test, and it must promptly implement all necessary repairs to ensure the proper operation of the alarm system. In the event of a failure of the security alarm system due to a loss of electrical support or mechanical malfunction that is expected to last longer than eight hours, an ATC must notify NJ DOH and the CRC and either provide alternative security measures or close the affected facilities until service is restored. Finally, each ATC and adult use cannabis business must equip its interior and exterior premises with electronic monitoring, video cameras, and panic buttons.
New Jersey Reporting Requirements
The reporting requirements for ATCs are governed by N.J.A.C. 8:64-4.3. The State of New Jersey allows ATCs to choose their method of electronic verification and a T&T system. In the course of operations, ATCs are required to conduct detailed monthly inventories and an annual comprehensive inventory. ATCs must retain records for at least two years. The reporting requirements for adult use cannabis businesses are governed by N.J.A.C. 17:30-9.11.

ATCs are subject to inspection by NJ DOH at any time, with or without notice. ATCs must provide immediate access to all facilities, materials, and information requested by NJ DOH. Failure to cooperate with an onsite assessment and or to provide access to the premises or information may be grounds to revoke the permit of the ATC and to refer the matter to state law enforcement agencies. If a problem is discovered, the ATC must notify NJ DOH in writing, with a postmark date that is within 20 business days of the date of the notice of violations, of the corrective actions the ATC has taken to correct the violations and the date of implementation of the corrective actions. Additionally, the NJ DOH is continually monitoring the operations of the ATC through our security and surveillance systems. The NJ DOH has the ability to access our surveillance system at any time and therefore may conduct a visual inspection of the premises at any time.
Adult use cannabis businesses are subject to inspection by the CRC at any time, with or without notice. adult use cannabis businesses must provide immediate access to all facilities, materials, and information requested by the CRC.

Ohio
Ohio Regulatory Landscape
Effective September 8, 2016, House Bill 523 legalized the use of medical cannabis for 26 debilitating conditions as prescribed by a licensed physician. The Ohio Medical Marijuana Control Program (“OMMCP”) allows people with certain medical conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, HIV/AIDS, ALS, cancer, traumatic brain injury, chronic pain, post-traumatic stress disorder and cachexia, to purchase medical cannabis. Though Ohio was required to implement a fully operational OMMCP by September 8, 2018 with a controlled system for cultivation, laboratory testing, physician/patient registration and dispensing, the timeline was delayed until November 2018.

Pennsylvania
Pennsylvania Regulatory Landscape
The Pennsylvania medical marijuana program was signed into law on April 17, 2016, under Act 16 (“Act 16”) and provided access to state residents with one or more of 17 qualifying conditions, including: epilepsy, chronic pain and PTSD. On March 22, 2018, it was announced that the final phase of the Pennsylvania medical marijuana program would initiate its rollout, which included 13 additional cultivation/processing licenses and 23 additional dispensary licenses. It was announced on April 17, 2018, that dry flower would be included in the regulations as an approved product form for sale and consumption (in addition to the already approved forms of concentrates, pills, and tinctures). Simultaneously, it was announced that the list of qualifying conditions would expand from 17 to 21, including additions of cancer remission therapy and opioid-addiction therapy. On July 20, 2019, two more qualifying medical conditions were added, bringing the total to 23. 
On June 30, 2021, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf signed into law H.B. 1024 (“Act 44”), which made revisions to Pennsylvania’s medical marijuana program, including codification of certain practices permitted under emergency orders issued in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The changes permit a wider range of individuals to serve as caregivers, including employees of long-term care and nursing facilities. The changes also permit dispensaries some additional operational flexibility, including providing limited, on-site outdoor order pickups, providing remote patient consultations, and providing medical dosages up to a 90 days' supply as opposed to a 30 days' supply.
On July 11, 2022, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf signed into law H.B. 311, containing an amendment that states that a “financial institution authorized to engage in business in this Commonwealth may provide financial services to or for the benefit of a legitimate cannabis -related business.” The same protections will apply to insurers. 
As of July 2022, adult use of cannabis remains illegal. 
Pennsylvania Licenses / Regulations 
There are two principal license categories in Pennsylvania: (1) cultivation/processing and (2) dispensary. All cultivation/processing establishments and dispensaries must register with Pennsylvania Department of Health under the provisions of Act 16 (35 P.S. §§ 10231.101—10231.2110) and Chapters 1141, 1151 and 1161 of the Pennsylvania regulations. Registration certificates are valid for a period of one year and are subject to annual renewals after required fees are paid and the business remains in good standing. The Pennsylvania Department of Health must renew a permit unless it determines the applicant is unlikely to maintain effective control against diversion of medical cannabis and the applicant is unlikely to comply with all laws as prescribed under the Pennsylvania medical marijuana program. 
Under applicable laws, the licenses permit the license holder to cultivate, manufacture, process, package, sell and purchase medical marijuana pursuant to the terms of the licenses, which are issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Health under the provisions of Act 16 and Pennsylvania regulations. The medical cultivation/processing licenses permit the licensee to acquire, possess, cultivate, manufacture/process into medical marijuana products and/or medical marijuana-infused products, deliver, transfer, have tested, transport, supply or sell marijuana and related supplies to medical marijuana dispensaries. The retail dispensary licenses permit the license holder to purchase marijuana and marijuana products from cultivation/processing facilities, as well as allow the sale of marijuana and marijuana products.
On March 5, 2021, the Department of Health proposed permanent regulations relating to medical marijuana, replacing the temporary regulations governing the program through its history. These proposed regulations are in substantially the same form as the temporary regulations, with only a few distinctions. One proposed revision identifies that a medical marijuana organization’s change in ownership without the Department of Health’s knowledge and written approval of all individuals affiliated with the medical marijuana organization would be a violation of the act and proposed rules. The proposed regulations also require dispensaries and grower/processors to supplement ongoing reports to the Department of Health with information related to the average price per unit of medical marijuana products sold, as opposed to the per-dose price. The proposed rules also increase the list of reasons for which the Department of Health may suspend or revoke a medical marijuana organization’s permit by adding falsification of information on any applications submitted to the Department of Health. The proposed regulations also address training, identifying that principals, as well as employees, who have direct contact with patients or caregivers or who physically handle medical marijuana plants, seeds and products must also complete a training.
