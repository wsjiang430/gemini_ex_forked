Our Company
Five Below is a leading high-growth value retailer offering trend-right, high-quality products loved by tweens, teens and beyond. We believe life is better when customers are free to “let go & have fun” in an amazing experience filled with unlimited possibilities. We offer a dynamic, edited assortment of exciting products, most priced at $5 and below, including select brands and licensed merchandise across eight worlds: Style, Room, Sports, Tech, Create, Party, Candy and New & Now. Based on our management’s experience and industry knowledge, we believe our customer-centric, experience-first, innovative approach to retail has led to a fiercely loyal customer base and has fostered universal appeal across a variety of age groups beyond our target demographic. 
We opened the first Five Below store in the greater Philadelphia area in 2002 and, since then, have been expanding throughout the United States. As of January 28, 2023, we operated a total of 1,340 locations across 42 states. Our new store model assumes a store size of approximately 9,500 square feet and is typically located within power, community and lifestyle shopping centers across a variety of urban, suburban and semi-rural markets. We opened 150 new stores in fiscal 2022 and we plan to open 200 new stores in fiscal 2023. We believe that we have the opportunity to grow our store base to more than 3,500 locations over time.
We also offer our merchandise on the internet, through our fivebelow.com e-commerce website as well as with an on demand third party delivery service to enable our customers to shop online and receive convenient same day delivery. All e-commerce sales, which includes shipping and handling revenue, are included in net sales and are included in comparable sales. Our e-commerce expenses will have components classified as both cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses. 
We believe that our business model has resulted in strong financial performance when considered in light of the economic environment:
•Our comparable sales decreased by 2.0% in fiscal 2022, increased by 30.3% in fiscal 2021, and decreased by 5.5% in fiscal 2020. Comparable sales results in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
•We expanded our store base from 1,020 stores at the end of fiscal year 2020 to 1,340 stores at the end of fiscal year 2022, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 14.6%. 
•Between fiscal 2020 and 2022, our net sales increased from $2.0 billion to $3.1 billion, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 25.2%. Over the same period, our operating income increased from $154.8 million to $345.0 million, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 49.3%.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following strengths differentiate Five Below from competitors and are the key drivers of our success:
•Unique Focus on the Tween and Teen Customer.    We target an attractive customer segment of tweens and teens with trend-right merchandise at differentiated price points. We have built our concept to appeal to this customer base, which we believe to be economically influential and resilient based on our industry knowledge and experience, as well as their parents and others who shop for them. Our brand concept, merchandising strategy and store ambience work in concert to create an upbeat and vibrant retail experience that is designed to appeal to our target audience, drive traffic to our stores and website, and keep our customers engaged throughout their visits. We monitor trends in the ever-changing tween and teen markets and are able to quickly identify and respond to trends. Our price points enable tweens and teens to shop independently, often using their own money to make frequent purchases of items geared primarily to them and to exercise self-expression through their independent retail purchases.
•Broad Assortment of Trend-Right, High-Quality Merchandise with Universal Appeal.    We deliver an edited assortment of trend-right as well as everyday products within each of our category worlds that changes frequently to create a sense of anticipation and freshness, which we believe provides excitement for our customers. We have a broad range of vendors, most of which are domestically-based, which enables us to shorten response lead times, maximizes our speed to market and equips us to make more informed buying decisions. Our unique approach encourages frequent customer visits, and the breadth, depth and quality of our product mix and the diversity of our category worlds attract shoppers across a broad range of age and socio-economic demographics.
•Exceptional Value Proposition for Customers.    We believe we offer a clear value proposition to our customers. Our price points, with most products priced at $5 and below, resonate with our target demographic and with other value-oriented customers. We are able to deliver on this value proposition through sourcing products in a manner that is designed to achieve low cost, fast response and high item velocity and sell-through. We maintain a dynamic and collaborative relationship with our vendor partners that provides us with favorable access to quality merchandise at attractive prices. We also have the ability to employ an opportunistic buying strategy, when appropriate, capitalizing on select excess inventory opportunities with our vendors. This unique and flexible sourcing strategy allows us to offer high-quality products at exceptional value across all of our category worlds.
•Differentiated Shopping Experience.    We believe we have created a unique and engaging in-store and online atmosphere that customers find fun and exciting. While we refresh our products frequently, we maintain a floor layout, designed with an easy-to-navigate flow and featuring sight-lines across the entire store enabling customers to easily identify our category worlds. All of our stores feature a sound system playing popular music throughout the shopping day. We employ novel and dynamic techniques to display our products, including distinctive merchandise fixtures and colorful and stimulating signage. This approach makes our stores a destination, encouraging hands-on interaction with our products and conveying our value pricing. We have developed a unique culture that emanates from our crew, many of whom frequently shop at Five Below, to our customers, thereby driving a higher level of connectivity and engagement. Additionally, we believe our price points, coupled with our dynamic merchandising approach, create an element of discovery, driving repeat visits and customer engagement.
•Powerful and Consistent Store Economics.    We have a proven store model that generates strong cash flow, consistent store-level financial results and a high level return on investment. Our stores have been successful in varying geographic regions, population densities and real estate settings and our new stores have achieved average payback periods of less than one year. We believe our robust store model, reinforced by our rigorous site selection process and in-store execution, drives the strength and consistency of our comparable sales and financial results across all geographic regions and store-year classes.
•Highly Experienced and Passionate Senior Management Team with Proven Track Record.    Our senior management team, led by Joel Anderson, our President and Chief Executive Officer, has extensive retail experience across a broad range of disciplines, including merchandising, real estate, finance, store operations, digital, supply chain management and information technology. Our management team drives our operating philosophy, which is based on a relentless focus on providing high-quality merchandise at exceptional value and a superior shopping experience utilizing a disciplined, low-cost operating and sourcing structure. We believe our management team is integral to our success and has positioned us well for long-term growth.
Growth Strategy
We believe we can grow our net sales and earnings by executing on the following strategies:
•Grow Our Store Base.    We believe there is significant opportunity to expand our store base throughout the United States from 1,340 locations as of January 28, 2023 to more than 3,500 locations within the United States over time. Based upon our strategy of store densification, we expect most of our near-term growth will occur within our existing markets, as well as new markets. This strategy allows us to benefit from enhanced brand awareness and achieve operational efficiencies. We opened 170 net new stores in fiscal 2021 and 150 new stores in fiscal 2022, and we plan to open 200 new stores in fiscal 2023. Our new store model assumes approximately 9,500 square feet and is primarily in-line locations within power, community and lifestyle shopping centers across a variety of urban, suburban and semi-rural markets. We have a talented and disciplined real estate management team and a rigorous real estate site selection process. We analyze the demographics of the surrounding trade areas and the performance of adjacent retailers, as well as traffic and specific site characteristics and other variables. As of January 28, 2023, we have executed lease agreements for the opening of 103 new stores in fiscal 2023.
•Drive Comparable Sales.    We expect to continue generating positive comparable sales growth by continuing to hone and refine our dynamic merchandising offering and differentiated in-store shopping experience. We intend to increase our brand awareness through cost-effective marketing efforts and enthusiastic customer engagement. We believe that executing on these strategies will increase the frequency of purchases by our existing customers and attract new customers to our stores.
•Increase Brand Awareness.    We have a cost-effective marketing strategy designed to promote brand awareness and drive store and website traffic. Our strategy predominantly includes the use of digital marketing, streaming video, television, philanthropic and local community marketing to support existing and new market entries. We leverage our growing e-mail database, mobile website and social media presence to drive brand engagement and increased store visits within existing and new markets. We believe that our digital experience is an extension of our brand and retail stores, serving as a marketing and customer engagement tool for us. Our digital experience allows us to continue to build brand awareness, grow online sales and expand our customer base.
•Enhance Operating Margins.    We believe we have further opportunities to drive margin improvement over time. A primary driver of our expected margin expansion will come from leveraging our cost structure as we continue to increase our store base and drive our average net sales per store. We intend to capitalize on opportunities across our supply chain as we grow our business and achieve further economies of scale.
Our History
The Company was incorporated in Pennsylvania in January 2002 under the name of Cheap Holdings, Inc. by David Schlessinger and Thomas Vellios, who recognized a market need for a fun and affordable shopping destination aimed at our target customer. We changed our name to Five Below, Inc. in August 2002. In July 2014, Joel Anderson joined the Five Below senior management team and he was appointed Chief Executive Officer effective February 1, 2015.
Our Market Opportunity
As a result of our unique merchandise offering and value proposition, we believe we have effectively tapped the tween and teen markets. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there were over 62 million people in the United States between the ages of 5 and 19, which represented approximately 20% of the U.S. population as of April 1, 2020. Based on management’s experience and industry knowledge, we believe that this segment of the population has a significant amount of disposable income as the vast majority of this age group’s basic needs are already met.
Our Merchandise
Strategy
We offer a dynamic, edited assortment of trend-right, high-quality products, with most priced at $5 or below, including select brands and licensed merchandise, targeted at the tween and teen customer. We believe we are transforming the shopping experience of our target demographic with a unique merchandising strategy and high-energy retail concept that our customers consider fun and exciting. Based on management’s experience and industry knowledge, we believe our compelling value proposition and the dynamic nature of our merchandise offering has fostered universal appeal to customers across a variety of age groups beyond our target demographic.
Our typical store features in excess of 4,000 products across a number of our category worlds including Style, Room, Sports, Tech, Create, Party, Candy and New & Now. We focus our merchandising strategy on maintaining core categories within our stores, but aim to generate high item velocity and sell-through to keep our assortment fresh and drive repeat visits. We monitor trends in our target demographic market, historical sales trends of current and prior products and the success of new product launches to ensure that our merchandise is relevant for our customers. We have a highly planned merchandise strategy focused on trend-right and everyday products supplemented by selected opportunistic purchases from our vendors to drive traffic and therefore offer our customers a consistently exciting shopping experience.
We believe we offer a compelling value proposition to our customers across all of our core product categories. The common element of our dynamic merchandise selection is the consistent delivery of exceptional value to the consumer, with most products offered at or below the $5 price point. Our pricing enables us to provide an extensive range of exciting products, while maintaining the attraction of a value retailer. Many of the products we sell can also be found in mall specialty stores, department stores, mass merchandisers and drug stores; however, we offer all of these products in an exciting and easy to shop retail environment at exceptional price points.
Product Mix
We organize the merchandise in our stores into the following category worlds:
•Style: Consists primarily of accessories such as novelty socks, sunglasses, jewelry, scarves, gloves, hair accessories, athletic tops and bottoms and “attitude” t-shirts. Our style offering also includes products such as nail polish, lip gloss, fragrance, and branded cosmetics.
•Room: Consists of items used to complete and personalize our customer’s living space, including glitter lamps, posters, frames, fleece blankets, plush items, pillows, candles, incense, lighting, novelty décor, accent furniture and related items.

•Candy: Consists of branded items that appeal to tweens and teens. This category includes an assortment of classic and novelty candy bars and movie-size box candy, seasonal-related candy as well as gum and snack food. We also sell chilled drinks via coolers.
•New & Now: Consists of seasonally-specific items used to celebrate and decorate for events such as Christmas, Easter, Halloween and St. Patrick’s Day. These products are most often placed at the front of the store.
Set forth below is data for the following groups of products – leisure, fashion and home, and snack and seasonal. The percentage of net sales represented by each product group for each of the last three fiscal years was as follows:

 | Percentage of Net Sales
2022 | | 2021 | 2020 
Leisure (1) | 47.6 | % | 49.6 | % | 49.2 | %
Fashion and home | 29.2 | % | 30.2 | % | 35.8 | %
Snack and seasonal (1) | 23.2 | % | 20.2 | % | 15.0 | %
Total | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

(1) Due to realignment of certain products, there was a minor adjustment to historical sales by product group.
Leisure includes items such as sporting goods, games, toys, tech, books, electronic accessories, arts and crafts, and party. Fashion and home includes items such as personal accessories, “attitude” t-shirts, beauty offerings, home goods and storage options. Snack and seasonal includes items such as seasonal goods, greeting cards, candy and other snacks, and beverages.
Our Stores
As of January 28, 2023, we operated 1,340 stores throughout the United States. Our new store model assumes a store size of approximately 9,500 square feet. Our stores are primarily located in power, community and lifestyle shopping centers; approximately 5% of our stores are located in malls. The following map shows the number of stores in each of the states in which we operated and the locations of our shipcenters as of January 28, 2023.
Store Design and Layout
We present our products in a unique and engaging in-store atmosphere. We maintain a floor layout designed with an easy-to-navigate flow and featuring sight-lines across the entire store enabling customers to easily identify our category worlds. All of our stores feature a sound system playing popular music throughout the shopping day. We employ novel and dynamic techniques to display our products, including distinctive merchandise fixtures and colorful and stimulating signage, which attract customers, encourage hands-on interaction with our products and convey our value pricing. In addition to traditional perimeter and gondola shelving, racks and tables, we utilize innovative approaches such as wheelbarrows, oil drums and bins strategically placed throughout our stores. These techniques foster customer interaction with products, supporting the strong relationship we strive to develop with our customers and enhance our upbeat and vibrant shopping environment.
Each of our category worlds is strategically located within our stores in an effort to enhance the customer’s shopping experience. For example, our New & Now offerings are located in the front of the store with the goal of catching customers’ attention and being “top of mind,” and specially featured value items and other key items are positioned along the center aisle. Impulse items and “dollar value” items surround the checkout areas to capture add-on purchases.
Expansion Opportunities and Site Selection
Our unique focus on the tween and teen customer is supported by our real estate strategy to locate stores in high-visibility locations. We seek to operate stores in high-visibility, high-traffic retail venues, which reinforce our brand message, heighten brand awareness and drive customer traffic.
Our strategy is to densify markets with clusters of stores because of the considerable benefit that stores derive from market concentration. Our store model is profitable across a variety of urban, suburban and semi-rural markets and in multiple real estate venues including power, community and lifestyle shopping centers. Our retail concept works well with a large and varied group of national co-tenants that drive customer traffic.
We select store sites for new store openings based upon certain criteria including minimum population density requirements, availability of attractive lease terms, sufficient space and strong positioning within a center. Crew on our real estate team spend considerable time evaluating prospective sites before bringing a proposal to our real estate committee. Our real estate committee, which is composed of senior management including our executive officers, approves all of our locations before a lease is signed.
We believe there is a significant opportunity to expand our store base in the United States. We opened 150 new stores in fiscal 2022 and we plan to open 200 new stores in fiscal 2023 through expansion in existing markets and by entering new markets. We maintain a pipeline of real estate sites that have been approved by our real estate committee and have executed 103 leases as of January 28, 2023 for new stores in fiscal 2023. The actual number, location and timing of new store openings in 2023 will depend on a number of factors, such as retail trends, competition, the general economic environment and our ability to hire and retain new store managers and crew. Our recent store growth is summarized in the following table:

Period | Stores atStart ofPeriod | StoresOpened | | StoresClosed | | NetStoreIncrease | | Stores atEnd ofPeriod
Fiscal 2020 | 900 | | 122 | | 2 | | 120 | | 1,020
Fiscal 2021 | 1,020 | | 171 | | 1 | | 170 | | 1,190
Fiscal 2022 | 1,190 | | 150 | | — | | 150 | | 1,340

Opening stores within existing markets enables Five Below to benefit from enhanced brand awareness and to achieve advertising, operating and distribution efficiencies. Our targeted new store openings include additional locations in existing markets as well as expansion into new markets. In existing markets, we use a store densification strategy that promotes brand awareness and leverages marketing, operating and distribution costs. When entering new markets, we employ a store clustering strategy, opening multiple stores in a single market on the same day, enabling us to leverage marketing and pre-opening expenses and generate initial new market brand awareness.
Our store growth is supported by our new store economics, which we believe to be compelling. Our new store model assumes a store size of approximately 9,500 square feet that achieves sales of approximately $2 million in the first full year of operation and an average new store cash investment of approximately $0.4 million, including our store build-out (net of tenant allowances), inventory (net of payables) and cash pre-opening expenses. Our new store model targets an average payback period of less than one year on our initial investment.
Store Operations
Each of our stores is managed by a store manager and one or two assistant managers who oversee full-time and part-time crew within each store. Each store manager is responsible for the day-to-day operations of his or her store, including the unit’s operating results, maintaining a clean and appealing store environment and the hiring, training and development of crew. We also employ district managers who are responsible for overseeing the operations of 10 to 15 stores, on average, and regional directors who are responsible for overseeing the operations of our district managers.
We are guided by a philosophy that recognizes strong sales performance and customer service, allowing us to identify and reward crew who meet our high performance standards. Store managers participate in a rewarding bonus incentive program. We also recognize individual performance through internal promotions and provide extensive opportunities for advancement.
Our crew are critical to achieving our goals, and we strive to hire talented people with high energy levels and motivation. We have well-established store operating policies and procedures and an in-store training program for new store managers, assistant managers and store associates. In addition, we have a dedicated group of training and new store opening managers who are focused on ensuring a consistent new store opening and remodel process and who leverage their extensive experience and knowledge of Five Below to train new store managers. Our customer service and store procedure training programs are designed to enable crew to assist customers in a friendly manner and to help create a positive sales-driven environment as well as teach successful operating practices and procedures.
Merchandising, Sourcing and Distribution
We have developed a disciplined approach to buying and a dynamic inventory planning and allocation process to support our merchandising strategy.
Merchandising
Our merchandising team consists of a Chief Merchandising Officer, who reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer, and is supported by an extensive team of merchandising crew. Our merchandising team works directly with our product development team and our central planning and allocation group to ensure a consistent delivery of products across our store base. Our Chief Merchandising Officer has over 30 years of experience within the retail sector. Our product development team works directly with our merchandising group to identify new and improved products through international sourcing and has significant experience within the retail sector.
Sourcing
We believe we have strong sourcing capabilities developed through a dynamic and collaborative relationship with our vendor partners that provide us with favorable access to quality merchandise at attractive prices. We regularly purchase core merchandise in accordance with our key categories. We also have the ability to employ an opportunistic buying strategy, when appropriate, capitalizing on selected excess inventory opportunities, to purchase complementary merchandise based on consumer trends, product availability and favorable economic terms.
We work with approximately 1,000 vendors, with no single vendor representing more than 5% of our purchases in fiscal 2022. We sourced approximately 60% of our purchases from domestic vendors in fiscal 2022. We typically have no long-term supply agreements or exclusive arrangements with our vendors.
Distribution and Fulfillment
We distribute approximately 85% of our merchandise for our retail stores from our approximately 1,030,000 square foot shipcenter in Indianapolis, Indiana, our approximately 1,000,000 square foot shipcenter in Pedricktown, New Jersey, our approximately 860,000 square foot shipcenter in Conroe, Texas, our approximately 860,000 square foot shipcenter in Buckeye, Arizona and our approximately 700,000 square foot shipcenter in Forsyth, Georgia, with the remaining merchandise shipped directly from the vendor to our stores. We realize cost savings by working with our vendors to streamline and reduce packaging to diminish shipping costs. 
For our direct-to-customer e-commerce business, we commenced fulfillment operations in Pedricktown, New Jersey in fiscal 2018, Buckeye, Arizona in fiscal 2021, and Indianapolis, Indiana in fiscal 2022.
We generally ship merchandise from our shipcenters to our stores one to four times a week, depending on the season and the volume of a specific store. We use either contract carriers or our own private-fleet of trucks to ship merchandise to our stores. 
We continuously assess ways to maximize the productivity and efficiency of our existing distribution facilities and evaluate opportunities for additional shipcenters. 
In March 2019, we completed the purchase of an approximately 700,000 square foot shipcenter in Forsyth, Georgia. The total amount paid for the land and building was approximately $42 million. We began operating the shipcenter in April 2019. 
In August 2019, we acquired land in Conroe, Texas, to build an approximately 860,000 square foot shipcenter. The total amount paid for the land and building was approximately $56 million. We began operating the shipcenter in July 2020. 
In July 2020, we acquired land in Buckeye, Arizona, to build an approximately 860,000 square foot shipcenter. The total amount paid for the land and building was approximately $65 million. We began operating the shipcenter in August 2021. 
In March 2021, we acquired land in Indianapolis, Indiana, to build an approximately 1,030,000 square foot shipcenter. The total amount paid for the land and building was approximately $60 million. We began operating the shipcenter in June 2022. 
As a result of the significant expansion of our network of distribution facilities over the last several years, including the opening of our Indianapolis, Indiana shipcenter in June 2022, we ceased operations at our shipcenters in Olive Branch, Mississippi and Cincinnati, Ohio in the first half of fiscal 2022. 
Marketing and Advertising
Our cost-effective marketing strategy is designed to promote brand awareness and drive store and website traffic with our target demographic, as well as other value-oriented customers. Our strategy includes highlighting our brand, exceptional value and quality proposition predominantly through the use of digital advertising, commercials (on television and through streaming), affiliate marketing, social influencers, content creators, syndicated talk show integrations and local marketing, with a focus on peak selling seasons. Additionally, we rely on the strong visibility and the presence of our store locations, email messaging and philanthropic community fundraising to promote and further our brand image and drive traffic. Our digital experience, anchored by our mobile e-commerce website, app and social media presence is growing rapidly as we utilize TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Snapchat to engage our customers with compelling digital content on a frequent basis.
Our marketing team, which reports into our Chief Merchandising Officer, works with our merchandising team to develop novel and dynamic techniques to display our products, including distinctive merchandise fixtures and colorful and stimulating signage, which attract customers, encourage hands-on interaction with our quality products and convey our value pricing.
For new store openings, we seek to create community awareness and consumer excitement predominantly through digital advertising, public relations, community outreach and events promoting the grand opening. We also aim to execute multiple store openings in a given new market on the same day in order to leverage marketing efforts to produce maximum impact.
In addition to our marketing and advertising efforts described above, we also maintain an e-commerce website (www.fivebelow.com) and, over the last few years, our online following has grown substantially. We use both our website and social media channels to highlight our featured products, value/quality proposition, store locations, employment opportunities, and grand openings.
Competition
We compete with a broad range of retailers including discount, mass merchandise, grocery, drug, convenience, variety and other specialty stores with both physical locations and online stores. Many of these retail companies operate stores in many of the areas where we operate, and many of them engage in extensive advertising and marketing efforts. We also compete with online retailers who do not have traditional brick and mortar locations.
The principal basis upon which we compete is by offering a dynamic, edited assortment of trend-right products, with most priced at $5 and below and also inclusive of select brands and licensed merchandise, targeted at the tweens, teens and beyond. We believe we are transforming the shopping experience of our target demographic with a unique merchandising strategy and high-energy retail concept that our customers consider fun and exciting. Our success also depends in substantial part on our ability to respond quickly to trends so that we can meet the changing demands of our customers. We believe that we 
compare favorably relative to many of our competitors based on our merchandising strategy, edited product assortment targeted at tweens and teens, store environment, flexible real estate strategy and company culture. Nonetheless, certain of our competitors have greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do.

We believe our current systems provide us with operational efficiencies, scalability, management control and timely reporting that allow us to identify and respond to merchandising and operating trends in our business. We use a combination of internal and external resources to support store point-of-sale, merchandise planning and buying, inventory management, financial reporting, real estate, human resource and administrative functions. We continuously assess ways to maximize productivity and efficiency, and evaluate opportunities to further enhance our existing systems.
Government Regulation
We are subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising, privacy laws, safety regulations and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that regulate retailers and/or govern the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of stores and shipcenters. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws.
Insurance
We maintain third-party insurance for a number of risk management activities including but not limited to workers’ compensation, cyber, directors & officers, general liability, property and crew-related health care benefits. We evaluate our insurance requirements on an ongoing basis to ensure we maintain adequate levels of coverage.

Employment Practices 
We aim to provide challenging, meaningful and rewarding opportunities for personal and professional growth of all crew and encourage all crew to bring their unique backgrounds and experiences to the table to work together. In order to promote the desired work environment, we have adopted policies which describe the standards of respect, inclusivity and professionalism expected of all crew.
As an equal opportunity employer, we comply with all federal, state and local laws. This means that we make all employment decisions (such as who to recruit, hire, train, promote, transfer, and terminate, as well as compensation decisions) without considering an crew’s or applicant’s sex, race, religion, color, gender (including gender identity and gender expression), national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, registered domestic partner status, age, sexual orientation, military and veteran status or any other characteristic protected by federal, state or local law. 
We do not and will not tolerate harassment, discrimination, retaliation, and disrespectful or other unprofessional conduct against crew or any other covered persons based on any protected characteristic. We also prohibit discrimination, harassment, disrespectful or unprofessional conduct based on the perception that anyone has any of those characteristics or is associated with a person who has or is perceived as having any of those characteristics. In addition, we will not retaliate against individuals who raise complaints of discrimination or harassment or who participate in workplace investigations or other protected activities. Furthermore, we are committed to maintaining a workplace free from sexual harassment and unwelcome conduct and recognizes sexual harassment as a form of workplace discrimination. 
We promote and strive to maintain a safe and healthy work environment and conduct our business in ways that protect our crew’s safety and are sensitive to the environment. We are committed to maintaining a drug-free workplace and prohibit the manufacture, distribution, sale, purchase, transfer, possession, or use of illegal substances in the workplace, while representing us outside the workplace or if such activity affects work performance or the work environment of the Company. 
We encourage open, timely communications that help us achieve organizational goals, share information, increase understanding, participate in the decision-making process, enhance our pride in the organization and provide recognition for our work-related successes. We believe our policies and practices are in compliance with all applicable laws and have been designed with significant inputs from the crew themselves.
Turnover
Retention of our talented crew is an important focus for us. We, therefore, monitor crew turnover, particularly at the store management level and employ various strategies to strive to improve our turnover rate. 
Crew Engagement
We engage our crew in a variety of ways, including: conducting an annual crew survey to directly engage with, and collect feedback from our crew, maintaining an open-door policy for crew to report concerns, and providing an anonymous reporting hotline, available in multiple languages and managed by an independent company not affiliated with us, to allow crew to voice concerns freely. 
The annual crew survey results help us understand the crew experience, evaluate our performance, identify our strengths, and pinpoint opportunities for improvement. Starting in fiscal 2020, we partnered with Gallup, Inc., a global analytics and advisory firm, to monitor and improve the engagement of our workforce. We utilize the survey results to identify strengths and weaknesses and create action plans to improve engagement and, ultimately, team performance. 
In 2022 a high percentage of our crew participated in the survey, and the results demonstrated that our overall engagement levels exceed Gallup’s averages in retail, in the United States and worldwide. The results also reflected that we are a mission-driven company with crew’s response on our strength of purpose far exceeding Gallup’s measurement for world class. 
Seasonality
Our business is seasonal in nature with the highest level of net sales and net income generated in the fourth fiscal quarter due to the year-end holiday season and, therefore, operating results for any fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the full fiscal year. To prepare for the holiday season, we must order and keep in stock more merchandise than we carry during other parts of the year. We expect inventory levels, along with an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, generally to reach their highest levels in the third and fourth fiscal quarters in anticipation of the increased net sales during the year-end holiday season. As a result of this seasonality, and generally because of variation in consumer spending habits, we experience fluctuations in net sales, net income and working capital requirements during the year.
