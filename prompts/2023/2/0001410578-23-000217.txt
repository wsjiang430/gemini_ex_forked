ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
ITH is a company engaged in the acquisition and development of mineral properties. The Company currently holds or has the right to acquire interests in a development stage project in Alaska referred to as the “Livengood Gold Project” or the “Project”. The Company has not yet begun extraction of mineralization from the deposit or reached commercial production. The Company has a 100% interest in the Livengood Gold Project, which as of December 31, 2022, has a measured and indicated mineral resource of 704.5 million tonnes at an average grade of 0.60 g/tonne (13.62 million ounces). As reported in the Technical Report Summary (the “TRS”) attached as Exhibit 96.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, a portion of the mineral resources at the Project have been converted into proven and probable reserves of 430.1 million tonnes at an average grade of 0.65 g/tonne (9.0 million ounces) based on a gold price of $1,680 per ounce. A more complete description of the Livengood Gold Project, including detailed presentation of resources and reserves, and the current activities is set forth in Part I, Item 2 and Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Prior to 2008, the Company focused primarily on the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties in Alaska and Nevada by acquiring through staking, purchase, lease or option (primarily from AngloGold Ashanti (U.S.A.) Exploration Inc. (“AngloGold”) in a transaction which closed on August 4, 2006) interests in a number of mineral properties in Alaska (Livengood Gold Project, Terra, LMS, BMP, Chisna, Coffee Dome, West Tanana, Gilles, West Pogo, Caribou, Blackshell and South Estelle) and Nevada (North Bullfrog and Painted Hills) that it believed had the potential to host large precious or base metal deposits. Since early 2008, the Company’s primary focus has been the exploration and advancement of the Livengood Gold Project and the majority of its resources have been directed to that end. In August 2010, ITH undertook a corporate spin-out arrangement transaction whereby all of its mineral property interests other than the Project were spun out as an independent and separate company. Since the completion of that transaction, the sole mineral property held by the Company has been the Livengood Gold Project and the Company has focused exclusively on the ongoing exploration and potential development of the Livengood Gold Project.
The head office and principal executive address of ITH is located at 200 Granville Street, Suite 2710, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6C 1S4, and its registered and records office is located at 745 Thurlow Street, Suite 2400, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6E 0C5.
Livengood Gold Project Developments
On March 9, 2022, the Company announced that the Board had approved a 2022 budget of $3.2 million. The 2022 work program advanced the baseline environmental data collection in critical areas of hydrology and waste rock geochemical characterization needed to support future permitting, as well as advanced community engagement.
Livengood Gold Project Technical Report Summary
On November 4, 2021, the Company announced the results of the Pre-feasibility Study for the Livengood Gold Project which are summarized in the TRS. The TRS details a project that would process 65,000 tons per day and produce 6.4 million ounces of gold over 21 years from a gold resource estimated at 13.6 million ounces at 0.60 g/tonne. The study utilized a third-party review by Whittle Consulting and BBA Inc. to integrate new interpretations based on an expanded geological database, improved geological modelling, new resource estimation methodology, an optimized mine plan and production schedule, additional detailed metallurgical work at various gold grades and grind sizes, changes in the target grind for the mill, new engineering estimates, and updated cost inputs, all of which significantly de-risk the Project. The TRS has estimated the capital costs of the Project at $1.93 billion, the total cost per ton milled at $13.12, the all-in sustaining costs at $1,171 per ounce, and net present value (5%) at $1,800/oz of $400 million.
The Project configuration evaluated in the TRS is a conventional, owner-operated surface mine that would utilize large-scale mining equipment in a blast/load/haul operation. Mill feed would be processed in a 65,000 tons per day comminution circuit consisting of primary and secondary crushing, wet grinding in a single semi-autogenous (“SAG”) mill and single ball mill followed by a gravity gold circuit and a conventional carbon in leach (“CIL”) circuit.

Whittle Enterprise Optimization
Prior to beginning the PFS, the Company retained Whittle Engineering and BBA Inc. to collaborate on an enterprise optimization study (the “Whittle and BBA Study”) to review various technologies and project configurations and to recommend the optimum configuration for the PFS. The Whittle and BBA Study reviewed secondary crushing with SAG and ball mill, tertiary crushing with ball mill, gravity/CIL at p80 of 90 micron to 250 micron, stand-alone and auxiliary heap leach configurations, gravity only gold recovery, gravity/flotation with pressure oxidation and CIL of flotation concentrate. These configurations were evaluated at various combinations of project ramp up strategy, annual throughput, primary, secondary, and tertiary grind size, as well as mining fleet size and stockpile management strategies. Tailings technologies reviewed included conventional tailings and pressure filtered tailings.
The Whittle and BBA Study determined that the gravity/CIL plant at p80 250 micron with conventional tailings provided the highest net present value, which is the configuration detailed in the PFS.
The PFS was prepared by independent third-party consultants. 
The Company cautions that the PFS is preliminary in nature, and is based on technical and economic assumptions which will be further refined and evaluated in a full feasibility study. The PFS is based on an updated Project mineral resource estimate effective as of August 20, 2021 using a different mineral resource model than used in the April 2017 Report.
The Company has determined that the mineral resource estimate of August 20, 2021 remains current as of December 31, 2022.
2023 Outlook
On March 8, 2023, the Company announced that the Board had approved a 2023 budget of $3.3 million and endorsed the associated 2023 work program to advance the Livengood Gold Project. The 2023 work program will advance the baseline environmental data collection in critical areas of hydrology and waste rock geochemical characterization needed to support future permitting, as well as advance community engagement.
The Company remains open to a strategic alliance to help support the future development of the Project while considering all other appropriate financing options. The size of the gold resource, the Project’s favorable location, and the Company’s proven team are some of the reasons the Company could potentially attract a strategic partner with a long-term development horizon who understands the Project is highly leveraged to gold prices.
Regulatory, Environmental and Social Matters
All of the Company’s currently proposed exploration is in the State of Alaska. In Alaska, low impact, initial stage surface exploration such as stream sediment, soil and rock chip sampling does not require any permits. The State of Alaska requires an APMA (Alaska Placer Mining Application) exploration permit for all substantial surface disturbances such as trenching, road building and drilling. These permits are reviewed by related state and federal agencies that can comment on and require specific changes to proposed work plans to minimize impacts on the environment. The permitting process for significant disturbances generally requires 30 days for processing and all work must be bonded. The Company currently has all necessary permits with respect to its currently planned exploration activities in Alaska. Although the Company has never had an issue with the timely processing of APMA permits, there can be no assurances that delays in permit approval will not occur.
The Board has established a Technical Committee, which has adopted a formal, written charter. As set out in its charter, the overall purpose of the Technical Committee is to assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the Company’s continuing commitment to improving the environment and ensuring that activities are carried out and facilities are operated and maintained in a safe and environmentally sound manner that reflects the Company’s ideals and principles of sustainable development. The primary function of the Technical Committee is to monitor, review and provide oversight with respect to the technical aspects of the Company’s projects as well as monitor policies, standards, and programs relative to health, safety, community relations and environmental-related matters. The Technical Committee also advises the Board and makes recommendations for the Board’s consideration regarding health, safety, community relations and environmental-related issues.

Although not set out in a specific policy, the Company strives to be a positive influence in the local communities where its mineral projects are located, not only by contributing to the welfare of such communities through donations of money and supplies, as appropriate, but also through hiring local workers to assist in ongoing exploration programs when appropriate. The Company considers building and maintaining strong relationships with local communities to be fundamental to its ability to continue to operate in such regions and to assist in the eventual development (if any) of mining operations in such regions, and it attaches considerable importance to commencing and fostering such relationships from the beginning of its involvement in any particular area.
Corporate Structure
ITH was incorporated under the Company Act (British Columbia) under the name “Ashnola Mining Company Ltd.” on May 26, 1978. ITH’s name was changed to “Tower Hill Mines Ltd.” on June 1, 1988, and subsequently changed to “International Tower Hill Mines Ltd.” on March 15, 1991. ITH has been transitioned under, and is now governed by, the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia).
ITH has three material subsidiaries:
●Tower Hill Mines, Inc. (“TH Alaska”), a corporation incorporated in Alaska on June 27, 2006, which holds most of the Company’s Alaskan mineral properties and is 100% owned by ITH;
●Tower Hill Mines (US) LLC, a limited liability company formed in Colorado on June 27, 2006, which carries on the Company’s administrative and personnel functions and is wholly owned by TH Alaska; and
●Livengood Placers, Inc., a corporation incorporated in Nevada on June 11, 1998, which holds certain Alaskan properties and is 100% owned by TH Alaska.

The following corporate chart sets forth all of ITH’s material subsidiaries:

Competition
ITH is a development stage company. The Company competes with other mineral resource exploration and development companies for financing, technical expertise and the acquisition of mineral properties. Many of the companies with whom the Company competes have greater financial and technical resources. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties. This competition could adversely impact the Company’s ability to finance further exploration and to achieve the financing necessary for the Company to develop its mineral properties.
Availability of Raw Materials and Skilled Employees
All aspects of the Company’s business require specialized skills and knowledge. Such skills and knowledge include the areas of geology, drilling, logistical planning, preparation of feasibility studies, permitting, construction and operation of a mine, financing and accounting. Since commencing its current operations in mid-2006, the Company has found and retained appropriate employees and consultants and believes it will continue to be able to do so in the future.

All of the raw materials the Company requires to carry on its business are readily available through normal supply or business contracting channels in Canada and the United States. Since commencing exploration activities at the Livengood Gold Project in mid-2006, the Company has been able to secure the appropriate personnel, equipment and supplies required to conduct its contemplated programs. The Company does not believe that it will experience any shortages of required personnel, equipment or supplies in the foreseeable future.
Human Capital Resources
At December 31, 2022, the Company had three employees. The Company also uses consultants with specific skills to assist with various aspects of project evaluation, engineering, community engagement and investor relations, and corporate governance.
Seasonality
As the Company’s mineral exploration activity takes place in Alaska, its business is seasonal. Due to the northern climate, exploration work on the Livengood Gold Project can be limited due to excessive snow cover and cold temperatures. In general, surface sampling work is limited to May through September and surface drilling from March through November, although some locations afford opportunities for year-round exploration operations and others, such as road-accessible wetland areas, may only be explored while frozen in the winter.
