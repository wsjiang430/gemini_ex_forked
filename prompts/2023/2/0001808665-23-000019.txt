ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Our Company 
We are a commercial pharmaceutical company offering differentiated products to patients utilizing a non-personal promotional model. Our commercial portfolio of branded products focuses on three areas: neurology, rheumatology, and pain and inflammation. We have built our commercial portfolio through a combination of increased opportunities with existing products, as well as through the acquisition or licensing of additional approved products. Our primary marketed products are:

INDOCIN® (indomethacin) Suppositories | A suppository and oral solution of indomethacin used both in hospitals and out-patient settings. Both products are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), indicated for: 
• Moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis including acute flares of chronic disease 
• Moderate to severe ankylosing spondylitis 
INDOCIN® (indomethacin) Oral Suspension | • Moderate to severe osteoarthritis 
• Acute painful shoulder (bursitis and/or tendinitis) 
• Acute gouty arthritis 
Otrexup® (methotrexate)injection for subcutaneous use | A once weekly single-dose auto-injector containing a prescription medicine, methotrexate. Otrexup is folate analog metabolic inhibitor indicated for the: 
 | • Management of patients with severe, active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA), who are intolerant of or had an inadequate response to first-line therapy. 
 | • Symptomatic control of severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis in adults who are not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy. 
Sympazan® (clobazam) oral film | A benzodiazepine indicated for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) in patients aged two years of age or older . Sympazan is the only product to offer clobazam in a convenient film with PharmFilm® technology. Sympazan is taken without water or liquid, adheres to the tongue, and dissolves to deliver clobazam. 
SPRIX® (ketorolac tromethamine) Nasal Spray | A prescription NSAID indicated in adult patients for the short-term (up to five days) management of moderate to moderately severe pain that requires analgesia at an opioid level. SPRIX is a non-narcotic nasal spray that provides patients with moderate to moderately severe short-term pain a form of ketorolac that is absorbed rapidly but does not require an injection administered by a healthcare provider.
CAMBIA® (diclofenac potassium for oral solution) | A prescription NSAID indicated for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults 18 years of age or older. CAMBIA can help patients with migraine pain, nausea, photophobia (sensitivity to light), and phonophobia (sensitivity to sound). CAMBIA is not a pill; it is a powder, and combining CAMBIA with water activates the medicine in a unique way. 
Zipsor® (diclofenac potassium) Liquid filled capsules | A prescription NSAID used for relief of mild-to-moderate pain in adults (18 years of age and older). Zipsor uses proprietary ProSorb® delivery technology to deliver a finely dispersed, rapid and consistently absorbed formulation of diclofenac. 

Other commercially available products include OXAYDO® (oxycodone HCI, USP) tablets for oral use only —CII. 
On October 27, 2022, we completed a transaction to acquire an exclusive license for Sympazan® (clobazam) oral film and Sympazan product inventory (the “Sympazan Acquisition”) from Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc. (“Aquestive”). Under the terms of the definitive agreement governing the Sympazan Acquisition, we acquired an exclusive license for the Sympazan intellectual property from Aquestive for an upfront payment of $9.0 million and a $6.0 million milestone payment contingent upon allowance of an existing patent application which, at the date of the transaction, Aquestive was prosecuting. The patent allowance was granted in the fourth quarter of 2022, which extends the patent coverage until 2040. Accordingly, we have paid in full the $6.0 million milestone payment. We are also required to pay Aquestive cash royalties on a quarterly basis equal to 10.0% of the gross margin (defined within the definitive agreement) from sales of Sympazan. We also entered into a long-term supply agreement with Aquestive for Sympazan. 
On August 22, 2022, we issued $70.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes which mature on September 1, 2027 and bear interest at the rate of 6.5% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year beginning March 1, 2023 (the “2027 Convertible Notes”). We used the net proceeds from the 2027 Convertible Notes to repurchase the remaining $59.0 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 13.0% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 (the “2024 Secured Notes”) and $3.0 million in associated interest payment pursuant to privately negotiated exchange agreements entered into concurrently with the pricing of the 2027 Convertible Notes. We expect to use the remaining net proceeds from the 2027 Convertible Notes for general corporate purposes. 
On February 27, 2023, we completed a transaction with a limited number of holders of our outstanding 2027 Convertible Notes (the “Exchanged Notes”) to exchange $30.0 million aggregate principal amount of Exchanged Notes pursuant to separate, privately negotiated exchange agreements for a combination of (a) a cash payment and (b) an agreed number of shares of our common stock. The shares of our common stock were issued in private placements exempt from registration in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. We paid an aggregate of $10.5 million in cash and issued an aggregate of approximately 7.0 million shares of our common stock in the transactions. We did not receive any cash proceeds from the issuance of the shares of our common stock. Refer to Note 10 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the 2027 Convertible Notes.
On December 15, 2021, we, through a newly-formed subsidiary, Otter Pharmaceuticals, LLC, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Antares Pharma, Inc. (“Antares”), and concurrently consummated the transaction (the “Otrexup Acquisition”). Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we acquired Antares’ rights, title and interest in and to Otrexup, including certain related assets, intellectual property, contracts, and product inventory for (i) $18.0 million in cash paid at closing, (ii) $16.0 million in cash paid on May 31, 2022, and (iii) $10.0 million in cash paid on December 15, 2022.
On May 18, 2021, we effected a 1-for-4 reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding par value $0.0001 common stock. The par value of the common stock was not adjusted as a result of the reverse stock split. All common stock share and per share data included in these financial statements have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the effect of the reverse stock split for all periods presented.
On May 20, 2020, we completed a merger (the “Zyla Merger”) with Zyla Life Sciences (“Zyla”) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 16, 2020 (the “Merger Agreement”). Pursuant to the Zyla Merger, we acquired our current commercial products INDOCIN (suppository and oral solution), SPRIX, and OXAYDO.
Collaboration and License Agreements
Miravo Pharmaceuticals: The Company has a license agreement with Tribute Pharmaceuticals Canada Ltd. (known as Miravo Pharmaceuticals, or “Miravo”) granting them the rights to commercially market CAMBIA in Canada. Miravo independently contracts with manufacturers to produce a specific CAMBIA formulation in Canada. We receive royalties on net sales on a quarterly basis as well as certain one-time contingent milestone payments upon the occurrence of certain events. We may receive additional one-time contingent milestone payments upon the achievement of scaling twelve-month cumulative sales targets and certain development milestones in the future.
Business Strategy 
Our success depends on our people, the unique and scalable digital platform we have created, and the opportunities that exist in the marketplace. We believe the following key elements enable us to be commercially successful:
•Leadership with a proven track record of successful results;
•significant experience in completing business development transactions in the healthcare space such as mergers, asset acquisitions, asset divestitures, and commercialization/licensing arrangements;
•a strategy that leverages digital and non-personal promotion to engage our customers and drive efficiency;
•experience in key elements of commercialization including, but not limited to, market access, patient services, distribution, brand and digital marketing, non-personal promotion, analytics, and market research;
•impactful brand promise for physicians and patients that reduces hassle and improves accessibility through access programs; and
•commercial capabilities and financial position that enable us to seamlessly expand our product offerings.
Our strategy is to grow through product acquisitions, commercialization agreements, licensing or technology agreements, equity investments, and business combinations. Our products have been acquired or licensed through business development activities. We continue to seek additional products, with a preference for accretive, on-market products that have 
patent life or exclusivity remaining that we can add to our portfolio of medicines. Secondarily, we also remain open to late-stage assets or other investments into medical devices, informatics, or technology. We are seeking products that are a fit with our commercial platform and can be leveraged and distributed via digital and non-personal promotional means. Our platform is specialty area agnostic and we can potentially acquire products across a number of therapeutic areas, while requiring minimal additional resources.
Impact of COVID-19 on our Business 
Following the outbreak of COVID-19 during early 2020, our priority was and remains the health and safety of our employees, their families, and the patients we serve. Because COVID-19 impacted our ability to see in-person providers who prescribe our products, we transformed our commercial approach during 2020 and increased virtual visits, ultimately eliminating our in-person sales force in favor of a digital sales strategy; a strategy we still maintain today and we plan to maintain. Limitations on elective surgeries and changes in patient behavior after the outbreak of COVID-19 impacted our operations by causing a decline and subsequent volatility in prescriptions associated with those elective procedures. The extent of any future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including actions by government authorities to contain future outbreaks, the emergence of new COVID-19 variants, the related potential for new surges in infections, the impacts on third parties on which we rely, including suppliers and distributors, and the impacts of increases in virtual physician visits on prescriber behavior. For example, although many public health restrictions have eased, future surges could result in additional restrictions or other factors that may contribute to decreases in elective procedures. 
Promotion of Products 

Beginning in 2021, we transformed our commercial model. The promotion of our products is now executed by a non-personal promotion model, utilizing omnichannel marketing and a digital selling approach. We have also integrated our virtual sales team with a view to maximize effectiveness with the providers and various sites-of-care that utilize our therapies. 
Using virtual and digital promotion allows us to quickly scale resources to meet the needs of our growing portfolio and is intended to ensure that we can be competitive across multiple therapeutic areas. Our commercial organization is comprised of multiple capabilities, including marketing, trade and distribution, and market access. The organization’s focus is finding new and novel ways to distribute product and improve patient access to our therapies. 
Seasonality
    Our product revenues have historically been lower in the first quarter of the year as compared to the fourth quarter of the preceding year. This variation is influenced by both wholesaler buying patterns and the reset of annual limits on deductibles and out-of-pocket costs of many health insurance plans and government programs at the beginning of each calendar year. For additional information, please also refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our product revenues have typically been lower in the first quarter of the year as compared to the fourth quarter of the preceding year.”
Segment and Customer Information
    We manage our business within one reportable segment. Segment information is consistent with how management reviews the business, makes investing and resource allocation decisions, and assesses operating performance. To date, substantially all of our revenues are related to product sales in the U.S.
Three large, national wholesale distributors represent the vast majority of our revenues from net product sales. The following table reflects the percentage of consolidated revenue by customer and the percentage of accounts receivable by customer related to product shipments for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

 | Consolidated Revenue | | Accounts Receivable related to product shipments
 | For the years ended December 31, | | For the years ended December 31, 
 | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2022 | 2021
AmerisourceBergen Corporation | 28 | % | | 26 | % | 21 | % | 29 | %
McKesson Corporation | 28 | % | | 24 | % | 25 | % | 23 | %
Cardinal Health | 23 | % | | 34 | % | 42 | % | 44 | %
All others | 21 | % | | 16 | % | 12 | % | 4 | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | % | 100 | %

The change in the percentage of consolidated revenue by customer and the percentage of accounts receivable by customer related to product shipments for the year ended December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by the impact of change in product mix. Each wholesale distributor purchases a different amount of each product, therefore the change in product mix impacts the percentage of consolidated revenue by customer and the percentage of accounts receivable by customer related to product shipments.
Manufacturing

Our facilities are used for office purposes only and no commercial manufacturing takes place at our facilities.
We are responsible for the supply and distribution of our marketed products. Our approved products are manufactured at contract manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Canada, and Italy. We have manufacturing, packaging, and supply agreements with sole commercial suppliers for each of our marketed products, as follows: 
•INDOCIN products - Patheon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Patheon”) and Cosette Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
•Otrexup - Antares Pharma, Inc. and Pharmascience Inc.
•Sympazan - Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc. 
•SPRIX - Jubilant HollisterStier LLC and Sharp Packaging Solutions
•CAMBIA - MiPharm, S.p.A. and Tioapack (formerly Pharma Packaging Solutions)
•Zipsor - Catalent Ontario Limited (“Catalent”) and Mikart Inc.
•OXAYDO - UPM Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Drug Substances
The active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) used in SPRIX is ketorolac tromethamine and in OXAYDO is oxycodone hydrochloride. Both INDOCIN oral suspension and suppositories use indomethacin as the API. We currently procure these APIs on a purchase order basis, some of which are pursuant to an agreement with one of our suppliers. We acquire ketorolac tromethamine and indomethacin from European-based manufacturers while we secure oxycodone hydrochloride from a U.S.-based manufacturer. Both CAMBIA and Zipsor use diclofenac potassium as the API, which we source from suppliers in Italy and Taiwan. OTREXUP uses Methotrexate as the API, which is sourced by our supplier from a manufacturer based in Germany. Sympazan uses Clobazam as the API, which is procured on a purchase order basis by our supplier from a manufacturer based in Italy.
Oxycodone hydrochloride is classified as a narcotic controlled substance under U.S. federal law and, as such, OXAYDO is classified as a Schedule II controlled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”). Schedule II controlled substances are classified as having the highest potential for abuse and dependence among drugs that are recognized as having an accepted medical use. Consequently, the manufacturing, shipping, dispensing and storing of OXAYDO are subject to a high degree of regulation, as described in more detail under the caption “Governmental Regulation—Controlled Substances.” Clobazam is classified as a benzodiazepine, a DEA Schedule IV controlled substance, having a low potential for abuse and low risk of dependence. 
    For additional information regarding our manufacturing, please also refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors - We depend on one qualified supplier for the active pharmaceutical ingredient in each of our products, and we depend on third parties that are single source suppliers to manufacture our products. Insufficient availability of our products or the active pharmaceutical ingredients and other raw materials necessary to manufacture our products, or the inability of our suppliers to manufacture and supply our products, will adversely impact our sales upon depletion of the active ingredient and product inventories.”

(1) Directed to processes of manufacture related to SPRIX.(2) Expiration date excludes any potential patent term adjustment.(3) Certain parties who have entered into settlement agreements with us are able to market generic versions of CAMBIA starting January 2023.(4) Certain parties who have entered into settlement agreements with us are able to market generic versions of Zipsor starting in March 2022. 

Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products and technologies. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary rights, by among other methods, filing patent applications in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions to cover certain aspects of our technology. Our patents may not be sufficiently broad to provide protection against competitors with similar technologies and may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or may not provide us with competitive advantages against competing products. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how, which are difficult to protect. We seek to protect such information, in part, through entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, collaborative partners and others before such persons or entities have access to our proprietary trade secrets and know how. These confidentiality agreements may not be effective in certain cases. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. For further information regarding risks associated with the protection of our intellectual property rights, please also refer to “Item 1A. “Risk Factors - We are not always able to protect our intellectual property and are subject to risks from liability for infringing the intellectual property of others.” 
Competition 
We face competition and potential competition from several sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, generic drug companies, and medical devices and drug delivery companies. SPRIX and INDOCIN products compete with currently marketed oral opioids, transdermal opioids, local anesthetic patches, stimulants and implantable and external infusion pumps that can be used for infusion of opioids and local anesthetics, non-narcotic analgesics, local and topical analgesics and anti-arthritics. There are no patents covering the INDOCIN products, which means that a generic drug company could file for and obtain approval of, and launch, a generic form of these drugs at any time. We are aware of other drug companies that have had interactions with regulatory agencies including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) relating to indomethacin, which could indicate the development of one or more INDOCIN product generics or other formulations of indomethacin. We are also aware of a 503B outsourcing facility (commonly referred to as a 503B compounder) that recently began compounding 100 mg indomethacin suppositories in what we believe to be violation of certain provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), including, among others, Section 505 approval requirements for new drugs and labeling requirements related to adequate directions for use. For further discussion of the risks related to the development INDOCIN Product generics and those related to 503B compounders, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Cambia and Zipsor recently began facing competition from generics and INDOCIN suppositories recently began facing competition from a 503B outsourcing facility (commonly referred to as a 503B compounder) which adversely affects our business. Approval of generic versions of our other products, including the INDOCIN products which are not patent protected and may face generic competition at any time, could have an adverse effect on our business.”
CAMBIA competes with a number of triptans that are used to treat migraines and certain other headaches. Currently, eight triptans are available generically and sold in the U.S. (almotriptan, eletriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan, sumatriptan-naproxen and zolmitriptan). There are other products prescribed for or under development for the treatment or prevention of migraines that are now or may become competitive with CAMBIA, including CGRP inhibitor products. Certain parties who have entered into settlement agreements with us began to market generic versions of CAMBIA in January 2023. Zipsor competes against other drugs that are widely used to treat mild to moderate pain in the acute setting, including both branded and generic versions of diclofenac. Certain parties who have entered into settlement agreements with us began to market generic versions of Zipsor in March 2022. Otrexup competes with other branded methotrexate products, including other injection and auto-injector products. Competition in the methotrexate market also includes tablets and parenteral dosage forms. In addition, other commonly used pharmaceutical treatments for rheumatoid arthritis include analgesics, NSAIDs, corticosteroids and biologic response modifiers. Sympazan competes with other generic and branded products in the treatment of LGS, including clobazam tablets and oral solution options. Competition in the LGS marketplace includes branded and generic anti-seizure medications, surgery, neuromodulations, and diet. Competing products developed in the future may prove superior to our products, either generally or in particular market segments. These developments could make our products noncompetitive or obsolete.
Government Regulation 
FDA Approval Process
In the U.S., pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. 
requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA delay or refusal to approve pending new drug applications (“NDAs”) or other marketing applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. The FDA approval process can be time consuming and cost intensive and companies may, and often do, re-evaluate the path of a particular product or product candidate at different points in the approval and post-approval process, even deciding, in some cases, to discontinue development of a product candidate or take a product off the market.
Preclinical and Clinical Studies
Governmental approval is required of all potential pharmaceutical products prior to the commercial use of those products. The regulatory process takes several years and requires substantial funds. Pharmaceutical product development in the U.S. for a new product or changes to an approved product typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (“IND”), which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics, and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing, along with other information that is known about an investigational drug product, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Longer-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans, unless the FDA authorizes that the clinical investigations in the IND may begin sooner than 30 days after submission. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin, as long as other necessary approvals (for example, an institutional review board (“IRB”) overseeing clinical study sites) have been granted.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with Current Good Clinical Practice (“cGCP”), which includes the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol intended to study an investigational new drug formulation must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, an independent IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences.
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. The study protocol and informed consent information for subjects in clinical trials must also be submitted to an IRB for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, concerns about subjects, or may impose other conditions. Sponsors have ongoing submission and reporting obligations to the FDA and IRBs, and the FDA and IRBs may exercise continuing oversight of a clinical trial.
Marketing Approval
FDA approval of an NDA is required before a product may be marketed in the U.S. Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. If the FDA determines that the application is not sufficiently complete to permit substantive review, it may request additional information and decline to accept the application for filing until the information is provided. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. During the review process, the FDA also reviews the drug’s product labeling to ensure that appropriate information is communicated to healthcare professionals and consumers.
As part of an application, the FDA may require submission of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) plan to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain adequate data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or partial or full waivers from the pediatric data requirements. 
Before an NDA is approved, the FDA generally inspects one or more clinical sites and facilities at which the drug is manufactured to ensure they are in compliance with the FDA’s cGCPs and Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”). If the FDA determines the application, data or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, the FDA may note the deficiencies in the submission and request additional testing or information. 
After evaluating the NDA, including all related information and clinical and manufacturing inspection reports, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter (“CRL”). A CRL generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to obtain final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
The review and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval of an NDA on a timely basis, or at all. 
If approved, the FDA may still limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-marketing Phase 4 clinical studies be conducted, require surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The results of post-marketing Phase 4 clinical studies may cause the FDA to prevent or limit further marketing of a product. After approval, certain changes to the approved product, such as manufacturing changes, new labeling claims, and new indications, are subject to additional requirements and FDA review and approval. 
Foreign regulatory approval of a product must also be obtained prior to marketing a product internationally. The clinical testing requirements and the time required to obtain foreign regulatory approvals may differ from that required for FDA approval and the time required for approval may delay or prevent marketing in certain countries.
Post-Approval Requirements 
Ongoing adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs and NDA specifications after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and obtain licenses from certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs or other applicable laws, such as adverse event recordkeeping and reporting. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and training and compliance effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs or other applicable laws, such as adverse event recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Regulatory authorities may require remediation, withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems or new concerns are subsequently discovered. In addition, other regulatory action, including, among other things, warning letters, the seizure of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution may be pursued.
Prescription Drug Marketing Act
The Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 and the Prescription Drug Amendments of 1992 govern the storage, handling, and distribution of prescription drug samples. The law prohibits the sale, purchase, or trade (including an offer to sell, purchase or trade) of prescription drug samples. It also imposes various requirements upon manufacturers, including but not limited to, proper storage of samples, documentation of request and receipt of samples, validation of a requesting practitioner’s professional licensure, periodic inventory and reconciliation of samples, notification to the FDA of loss or theft of samples, and procedures for auditing sampling activity. Some similar state laws apply. In addition, section 6004 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act also requires manufacturers to annually report the identity and quantity of drug samples that were requested and distributed to licensed health care providers (“HCPs”) in a given year.
Orange Book Listing
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product, active ingredient, or method of use. Upon approval of a drug, each of the listed patents covering the approved drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the “Orange Book”. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”). An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredient(s) in the same strengths and dosage form, with essentially the same labeling as the listed drug, and that has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are generally not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved under an ANDA are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and often can or are required to be substituted by pharmacists fulfilling prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
The ANDA applicant is required to certify or make certain representations to the FDA concerning any patents currently listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) no relevant patent information has been filed, (ii) a listed patent has expired, (iii) a listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration, or (iv) a listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the marketing of the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA labeling does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding a patented method‑of‑use. If the ANDA applicant does not challenge the applicability of the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced NDA product have expired.
A certification that the ANDA product will not infringe the already approved NDA product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earliest of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non‑patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired.
Manufacturing Requirements
We, our suppliers, contract manufacturers, and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved drugs are required to comply with certain post-approval requirements and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies to assess compliance with cGMP requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Failure to achieve or maintain cGMP standards for our products would adversely impact their marketability.
We use third-party manufacturers to produce our products in clinical and commercial quantities, and we cannot be certain that future FDA inspections will not identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. Additionally, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. 
Third‑Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement
The commercial success of our products is partially dependent on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from public (i.e., federal and state government) and private (i.e., commercial) payors. These third‑party payors may deny coverage or reimbursement for a product or therapy, either in whole or in part, if they determine that the product or therapy was not medically appropriate or necessary. Also, third‑party payors continue to control costs by limiting coverage through the use of formularies and other cost‑containment mechanisms, and the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments.
The cost of pharmaceutical products continues to generate substantial governmental and third‑party payor interest. We expect the pharmaceutical industry will continue to experience pricing pressures, given the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations, and additional regulatory and legislative proposals. Our results of operations and business could be adversely affected by current and future third‑party payor policies, as well as healthcare legislative reforms.
Some third‑party payors also require pre‑approval of coverage for new or innovative drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, these requirements or any announcement or adoption of such proposals could have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for any future product candidates and to operate profitably.
Fraud and Abuse
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with accounting provisions requiring the companies to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the companies, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Pharmaceutical companies that participate in federal healthcare programs are subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including anti‑kickback and false claims laws. Violations of U.S. federal and state fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid).
Federal statutes that apply to us include the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, which prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration in exchange for, or to generate business, including the purchase or prescription of a drug, that is reimbursable by a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the Federal False Claims Act (“FCA”), which generally prohibits knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to the federal government any false, fraudulent or medically unnecessary claims for reimbursed drugs or services. Government enforcement agencies and private whistleblowers have asserted liability under the FCA for claims submitted involving inadequate care, kickbacks, improper promotion of off‑label uses, and misreporting of drug prices to federal agencies.
Similar state laws and regulations, such as state anti‑kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non‑governmental payors, including private insurers. These state laws may be broader in scope than their federal analogues, such as state false claims laws that apply where a claim is submitted to any third‑party payor, regardless of whether the payor is a private health insurer or a government healthcare program, and state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to certify compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines.
Federal and state authorities have increased enforcement of fraud and abuse laws within the pharmaceutical industry, and private individuals have been active in alleging violations of the law and bringing suits on behalf of the government under the FCA and under state and local laws. These laws are broad in scope and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that definitively interpret these laws and apply them to particular industry practices. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change.
Controlled Substances
The DEA is the federal agency responsible for domestic enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (“CSA”). The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV and V substances. Schedule I substances, by definition, have high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in the U.S., and lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and may not be marketed or sold in the U.S. except for research and industrial purposes. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. 
Sympazan
Sympazan, a Clobazam lingual film product, is regulated as a Schedule IV controlled substance by the DEA. 
Oxycodone
OXAYDO, an immediate release oxycodone product designed to discourage abuse via snorting, is regulated as a Schedule II controlled substance as defined in the CSA. Other companies’ oxycodone products have been subject to recent scrutiny, litigation, and concerns. 
In addition, a DEA quota system controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule II. Distributions of any Schedule II controlled substance must also be accompanied by special order forms. Any of our products regulated as Schedule II controlled substances are subject to the DEA’s production and procurement quota scheme. The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how oxycodone may be produced in total in the U.S. based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. The limited aggregate number of opioids that the DEA allows to be produced in the U.S. each year is allocated among individual companies, who must submit applications annually to the DEA for individual production and procurement quotas. Our company (and our license partners and contract manufacturers) receive an annual quota from the DEA that enables us to produce or procure specific quantities of Schedule II substances, including oxycodone hydrochloride for use in manufacturing OXAYDO. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether to make such adjustments. The quotas we are provided for specific active ingredients may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials. Any delay, limitation or refusal by the DEA in establishing our, or our contract manufacturers’, quota for controlled substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product commercialization, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations.
To enforce these requirements, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in administrative, civil or criminal enforcement action, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate administrative proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could result in criminal proceedings.
Individual states also independently regulate controlled substances. We and our license partners and our contract manufacturers are subject to applicable state regulation on distribution of these products.
Prescription Limitations
Many states, including the Commonwealths of Massachusetts, and Virginia and the States of New York, Ohio, Arizona, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island, Colorado, Wisconsin, Alabama, South Carolina, Washington and New Jersey, have either recently enacted, intend to enact or have pending legislation or regulations designed to, among other things, limit the duration and quantity of initial prescriptions of the immediate-release form of opiates, such as our product OXAYDO, mandate the use by prescribers of prescription drug databases, and mandate prescriber education. These and other state and local laws applicable to the pharmaceutical industry have and may in the future affect our business and operations as well as those of our commercialization and development partners.
Impact of Public Pressure on Drug Pricing, Healthcare Reform and Legislation Impacting Payor Coverage
The pricing and reimbursement of our pharmaceutical products is partially dependent on government regulation. We offer discounted pricing or rebates on purchases of pharmaceutical products under various federal and state healthcare programs, including: (i) Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, (ii) Medicare Part B 
Program and Medicare Part D Coverage Gap Discount Programs, (iii) the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ Federal Supply Schedule Program, and (iv) the Health Resources and Services Administration’s 340B Drug Pricing Program. These rebates are subject to our active participation in the respective programs. We must also report specific prices to government agencies under healthcare programs, such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part B Program. The calculations necessary to determine the prices reported are complex and the failure to report prices accurately may in the future expose us to penalties. 
In the U.S., federal and state government healthcare programs and private third-party payors routinely seek to manage utilization and control the costs of our products. In the U.S., there is an emphasis on managed healthcare, which has put additional pressure on pharmaceutical drug pricing, and reimbursement and usage, and has adversely affected our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, including formulary coverage and positioning, laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies, and pricing in general.
Efforts by federal and state government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including legislation on drug importation, could adversely affect our business if implemented. Recently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing, resulting in proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals, and drug pricing continues to be an agenda item at both the federal and state level. 
The U.S. pharmaceutical industry has already been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including, for example, the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (“ACA”). The ACA, among other things, imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug medicines. It also contains substantial provisions intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, and impose additional health policy reforms, and, from time to time, our business has been affected by the ACA and certain of these provisions. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and congressional challenges to numerous provisions of the ACA. We continue to face uncertainties due to federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify, or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the ACA. 
In addition, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) contains provisions intended to lower beneficiary drug spending. Beginning in 2023, the IRA enables Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices with manufacturers of certain high-cost drugs for the first time. A separate provision requires drug manufacturers to pay rebates to Medicare if their drug prices increase at a higher rate than the rate of inflation (the so-called inflation rebate provision). Additionally, effective in 2024, the IRA will eliminate the 5% coinsurance for catastrophic coverage under Medicare Part D; in 2025, the IRA will cap the beneficiary annual out-of-pocket expenditure. These efforts to reduce aggregate beneficiary spending are expected to shift some costs to drug manufacturers.
Any future healthcare reform efforts, including those related specifically to the ACA, and any that further limit coverage and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products, may adversely affect our business and financial results. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare, or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the U.S., the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale, and promotion of drug products are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) (e.g., the Office of Inspector General, “OIG”), the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, and other state and local government agencies. For example, pharmaceutical manufacturers’ activities (including sales and marketing activities, as well as scientific/educational grant programs, among other activities) are subject to fraud and abuse laws, such as the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, as amended, and similar state laws. Typically, pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. These activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
The federal Anti‑Kickback Statute prohibits any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer, or a party acting on its behalf, from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce another to (i) refer an individual for the furnishing of a pharmaceutical product for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid (“covered product”); (ii) purchase or order any covered 
product; (iii) arrange for the purchase or order of a covered product; or (iv) recommend a covered product. This statute has been interpreted broadly to apply to a wide range of arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers and others, including, but not limited to, any exchange of remuneration between a manufacturer and prescribers (such as physicians), purchasers, pharmacies, PBMs, formulary managers, group purchasing organizations, hospitals, clinics and other health care providers, and patients. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, and rebates, “value-added” services, the furnishing of supplies or equipment at no charge, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests, and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Although there are several statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce referrals, prescribing, purchasing, or recommending covered products may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. 
Additionally, many states have adopted laws like the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, and some of these state prohibitions apply, in at least some cases, to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third‑party payor, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and do not contain safe harbors. Violations of fraud and abuse laws such as the Anti-Kickback Statute may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions and/or exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Our arrangements and practices may not, in every case, meet all criteria for applicable exceptions and/or safe harbors for the Anti‑Kickback Statute, and thus would not be immune from prosecution under the statute. Additionally, the Anti‑Kickback Statute and similar state laws are subject to differing interpretations and may contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Finally, some of the safe harbor rules are currently under review for potential revision. Given these variables, our activities could be subject to the penalties under the Anti-Kickback Statute and similar authorities.
The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The “qui tam” provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has violated the False Claims Act, and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third‑party payor, not merely a federal healthcare program. 
There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The False Claims Act has been used to assert liability based on inadequate care, kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics, such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, improper use of Medicare numbers when detailing the provider of services, improper promotion of off‑label uses not expressly approved by FDA in a drug’s label, and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. Our activities relating to the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement of our products, and the sale and marketing of our products and our service arrangements or data purchases, among other activities, may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. 
We are unable to predict whether we would be subject to actions under the False Claims Act or a similar state law, or the impact of such actions. However, the cost of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could adversely affect our financial performance. Also, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created several federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third‑party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement about the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
In addition, our marketing activities may be limited by data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. For example, HIPAA and its implementing regulations established standards for “covered entities,” which are certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, regarding the security and privacy of protected health information. While we are not a covered entity under HIPAA, many of our customers are, and this limits the information they can share with us. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) expanded the applicability of HIPAA’s privacy, security, and breach notification standards. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security and breach standards (and certain privacy standards) directly applicable to “business associates,” which are entities that perform certain services on behalf of covered entities involving the exchange of protected health information. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered 
entities, business associates, and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. While we do not currently perform any services that would render us a business associate under HIPAA/HITECH, it is possible that we may provide such services in the future and would be subject to the applicable provisions of HIPAA/HITECH. Finally, we are subject and are likely to be subject in the future to state privacy and security laws, regulations and other authorities— specifically including the California Consumer Privacy Act— which may limit our ability to use and disclose identifiable information, and may impose requirements related to safeguarding such information, as well as reporting on breaches.
Additionally, the federal Open Payments program, created under Section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations, requires that manufacturers of prescription drugs for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to HHS information related to “payments or other transfers of value” provided to U.S. “physicians” (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors); certain other “healthcare providers” (including physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, certified nurse-midwives); and “teaching hospitals.” The Open Payments program also requires that manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations report annually to HHS ownership and investment interests held in them by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members. Manufacturers’ reports are filed annually with the CMS by March 31, covering the previous calendar year. CMS posts disclosed information on a publicly available website annually by June 30. 
There are also an increasing number of state laws that regulate or restrict pharmaceutical manufacturers’ interactions with healthcare providers licensed in the respective states. Beyond prohibiting the provision of certain payments or items of value, these laws require pharmaceutical manufacturers to, among other things, establish comprehensive compliance programs, adopt marketing codes of conduct, file periodic reports with state authorities regarding sales, marketing, pricing, and other activities, and register/license their sales representatives. Laws require manufacturers to file reports regarding payments and items of value provided to health care providers (similar to the federal Open Payments program). Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. These laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. Given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, despite our best efforts to act in full compliance, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, from time to time some of our business activities are subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be in the future subject to penalties— including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre‑marketing product approvals, private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts including government contracts and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations— any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. With respect to any of our products sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable privacy laws and post‑marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti‑fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs, and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
