ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Company
 
Superior Drilling Products, Inc. (the “Company”, “SDPI”, “we”, “our” or “us”) is an innovative drilling and completion tool technology company providing cost saving solutions that drive production efficiencies for the oil and natural gas drilling industry. Our headquarters and manufacturing operations are located in Vernal, Utah. Our drilling solutions include the patented Drill-N-Ream® well bore conditioning tool (“Drill-N-Ream tool” or “DNR”) and the patented Strider™ Drill String Oscillation System technology (“Strider technology” or “Strider”). In addition, the Company is a manufacturer and refurbisher of PDC (polycrystalline diamond compact) drill bits. We operate a state-of-the-art fabrication facility where we manufacture solutions for the drilling industry, as well as various customers’ custom products in other industries. We are also developing a Middle East repair center.
 
Our history dates back to 1995 when we were founded by Troy and Annette Meier as a drill bit refurbishment company. Our co-founder, Troy Meier, developed the first commercially-viable process for refurbishing PDC drill bits after a successful 13-year career with a predecessor of Baker Hughes Inc. He was also co-inventor of the patented Drill-N-Ream® tool. We were incorporated on December 10, 2013 under the name SD Company, Inc. in order to facilitate (a) the reorganization of the entities that are now our consolidated subsidiaries and (b) the subsequent acquisition of Hard Rock Solutions, LLC (“HR”). We changed our name from SD Company Inc. to Superior Drilling Products, Inc. on May 22, 2014 in conjunction with closing of that reorganization and our initial public offering, which occurred on May 23, 2014 (“Offering” or “IPO”). Our corporate headquarters and manufacturing operations are located in Vernal, Utah. Our common stock trades on the NYSE American exchange under the ticker symbol “SDPI”.
 
Our subsidiaries include (a) Superior Drilling Solutions, LLC (previously known as Superior Drilling Products, LLC), a Utah limited liability company (“SDS”), together with its wholly owned subsidiary Superior Design and Fabrication, LLC, a Utah limited liability company (“SDF”), (b) Extreme Technologies, LLC, a Utah limited liability company (“ET”), (c) Meier Properties Series, LLC, a Utah limited liability company (“MPS”), (d) Meier Leasing, LLC, a Utah limited liability company (“ML”), and (e) HR.
 
Global Market Conditions
 
The oil and gas industry has been in a rapid recovery the last two years following the significant fall off of activity with the global pandemic in March 2020.Activity in the oil field is typically measured by rig counts. Total U.S. rig count as reported by Baker Hughes as of March 3, 2023 was 749 rigs, an increase of 99 rigs from the rig count as of December 31, 2021. 
 
The Middle East market began to improve during 2022 after a slow rebound from the COVID-19 impact. Total rig count in that region as of February 28, 2023 was 327 compared with 282 at the same time last year.
 
Background of Business
 
We innovate, design, engineer, manufacture, sell, and repair drilling and completion tools in the United States, Canada, and the Middle East.
 
We currently have three basic operations:
 

● | Our PDC drill bit and other tool refurbishing and manufacturing service, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our emerging technologies business that manufactures the Drill-N-Ream tool, our innovative drill string enhancement tool, the Strider technology and other tools, and

Our strategy for growth is to expand the global market penetration of our current drilling tool solutions and to leverage our expertise in drilling tool technologies and precision machining in order to broaden our product offerings and solutions for the oil and gas industry, as well as other industries that require precision machining and quality. We believe through our patented technologies, as well as technologies under development, that we can offer the oil and gas industry the solutions it demands to improve drilling efficiencies and reduce production costs.
 
Major Customers
 
The Company has Vendor Agreements with Baker Hughes Oilfield Operations LLC (“Baker Hughes”), Drilling Tools International (“DTI”), Weatherford U.S., L.P. (“Weatherford”), Odfjell Drilling, National Energy Services Reunited Corp. (“NESR”) and Schlumberger Oman & Co. LLC (“Schlumberger”).
 
Baker Hughes: We have manufactured and refurbished PDC drill bits exclusively for Baker Hughes’s oilfield operations in the Rocky Mountain, California and Alaska regions as well as other areas as needed for since 1996. In 2018, we re-negotiated our agreement with Baker Hughes whereby we now refurbish PDC bits for all of Baker Hughes’s U.S. geographic areas. In 2020, we further re-negotiated our agreement whereby we can now refurbish PDC bits for any PDC bit supplier. We are currently in the process of renewing our contract.
 
DTI: We have been working with DTI since 2016. DTI purchases our Drill-N-Ream tool for their rental tool business. We receive revenue from DTI for tool sales, tool repairs and a royalty fee based on the tools usage. Pursuant to our original agreement, DTI was required to achieve certain market share requirements in order to maintain exclusive marketing rights for the Drill-N-Ream in the U.S. and Canada, both onshore and offshore. DTI did not achieve the defined market share goals in 2017 and, therefore, no longer has exclusive rights to market the Drill-N-Ream. As a result, the Company can work with other customers to expand the market reach of the Drill-N-Ream in the U.S. and Canada.
 
International: We are working with Weatherford, Odfjell Drilling, NESR, and Schlumberger to introduce and gain exposure of our Drill-N-Ream tool to large Middle East operators in Kuwait and Oman.
 
Our Products
 
Drill-N-Ream Tool. The Drill-N-Ream tool is a dual-section wellbore conditioning tool which is located approximately 150 feet behind the bottom hole assembly, also known as BHA. Concurrently as the well bore is being drilled, the Drill-N-Ream tool conditions the well bore. It smooths and slightly enlarges the well drift in all sections of horizontal or directionally-drilled wells, in both oil and water-based mud. It reduces tortuosity resulting from the geo-steering drill bit, and the overcorrections and formation interactions that occur during directional drilling. With the well bore conditioned by the Drill-N-Ream, the drill string is then able to move through the conditioned well bore with less friction and stress.
 
The Drill-N-Ream tool accelerates drilling speed and extends the horizontal distance of the well bore by:
 

● | Smoothing out ledges and doglegs left by the bit, which allows the drill string to move through a conditioned well bore with less friction and stress, 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Reducing tool joint damages and trip time (i.e. the time required to remove and reinsert the drill string), 
● | Enhancing the power available to drive the drill bit assembly, 
● | Extending the horizontal distance that can be drilled during a run, 
● | Improving the running of casing in the completed well much easier, and 
● | Tripping out of the hole on elevators, rotation not required. 

 
The number of “trips” required by the operator, or the number of times the drill string has to be removed and reinserted in the wellbore, is reduced as a result of the performance of the Drill-N-Ream tool. Each time a drilling operator has to trip the drill string and replace a bit or other drill string component, it costs the operator substantial time and money, so we believe anything that allows each run to extend further without additional tripping is of great value to our customers. Traditional methods for conditioning the well bore entails removing the drill string and running a dedicated reamer through the well bore, typically in two separate runs. The Drill-N-Ream tool eliminates the need for dedicated reamer runs, and therefore reduces the cost of drilling a horizontal well.
 
The Drill-N-Ream tool is available in multiple sizes and can be custom manufactured to accommodate most drill hole sizes.

We believe that the Drill-N-Ream tool’s rapid adoption and continued use by operators validates its effectiveness and industry acceptance. In fact, leading operators have begun to standardize their drilling assembly with a Drill-N-Ream tool. In addition, we understand that a number of end users have rented the Drill-N-Ream tool after first trying competitive products. We expect the above factors to support increasing interest in, and revenue from, the Drill-N-Ream tool over the next several years as more well operators’ reports of its effectiveness are transmitted through word-of-mouth by an increasing user base to other well operators globally.
 
Strider Technology. The Strider technology utilizes its unique patented design to reduce drill string friction on horizontal wells, resulting in improved rates of penetration and cost savings. The Strider technology is designed to help dissipate the inertial drag of a horizontal drill string by generating rhythmic pulses that break the frictional connection between the drill strings and well bore greatly enhancing drilling rates. Its revolutionary engineering provides a cost-effective alternative to conventional downhole vibration tools.
 
The Strider technology is composed of two main parts, a hydraulic channeling chamber (“HCC”) and a rhythmic pulsation chamber (“RPC”). The RPC contains a precisely engineered, high speed pulse-valve that systematically restricts flow area. During flow restriction, or “closure”, the ideal amount of fluid is allowed to continue down hole. This perfectly controlled hydraulic flow produces an optimal pulse frequency, which is preferred for bottom hole assembly equipment. The optimal pulse frequency also allows for placement of the Strider technology closer to the bit than typical oscillation tools.
 
We believe that our Strider technology is at the forefront of drill string tool technological development for horizontal drilling. We also believe our Strider technology offers significant advantages over our competitors’ drill string stimulation tools.
 
V-Stream advanced conditioning system (“V-Stream”). The V-Stream tool is an integral spiral blade stabilizer and is engineered to combine stabilization with reaming. A cavity or plenum in the middle of the blades facilitates enhanced fluid flow for cuttings transport and reduces torque when compared with typical stabilizers with similar overall blade length. Non-active cutters at gauge enable the V-Stream to remove formation and condition the hole while controlling deviation. With these unique features, the V-Stream will stabilize the bottom hole assembly and condition the hole simultaneously to optimize the drilling operations.
 
Our Strategy for Growth
 
Our strategy for growth is to expand the global market penetration of our current drilling tool solutions and to leverage our expertise in drilling tool technologies and precision machining in order to broaden our product offerings and solutions for the oil and gas industry, as well as other industries that require precision machining and quality. We believe through our patented technologies, as well as technologies under development, that we can offer the oil and gas industry the solutions it demands to improve drilling efficiencies and reduce production costs. Specific examples of this strategy include:
 
Leverage highly advanced tool technologies. We currently have two highly differentiated advanced drilling tool technologies (the Drill-N-Ream tool and the Strider technology) that address challenges encountered in the oil and gas drilling marketplace.
 
Expand our channels to market and geographic reach. We are leveraging existing distribution channels in the exploration and production industry. We have entered into an agreement with DTI, establishing DTI as a distributor of our patented Drill-N-Ream tool in the United States and Canada onshore and offshore markets. As a result of this agreement, our technology has penetrated the market more efficiently by leveraging DTI’s long-term relationships with end users. We are also evaluating opportunities to further our reach into the North American market.
 
We are expanding our channels to market and our geographic presence, especially in the Middle East as evidenced by agreements that we entered into with Weatherford in December 2017, Odfjell Drilling in November 2018, NESR in 2019 and Schlumberger in 2021. We expect to add additional distributors as we expand our tool offering and geographic reach. We also expect to leverage our distributor and customer relationships to identify needs for new tool development and to use these channels to market a broadened product offering as it is developed.
 
Strengthen and support our employees. Our experienced employees and management team are some of our most valuable resources. Attracting, training, and retaining key personnel, has been and will continue to be critical to our success. To achieve our goals, we intend to remain focused on providing our employees with training, personal and professional growth opportunities, as well as adding performance-based incentives, including opportunities for stock ownership, and other competitive benefits. We are also working with the local university and high school to develop and teach local programs in machining and engineering expertise and technical resources.

Seek strategic acquisitions to enhance or expand our product lines. While our focus is on organic growth, we may identify new technologies to add to our arsenal of tools for the exploration and production industry. In analyzing new acquisitions, we intend to pursue opportunities that complement our existing product line and/or that are geographically situated within our current market. We believe that strategic acquisitions will enable us to exploit economies of scale in the areas of finance, human resources, marketing, administration, information technology, and legal, while also providing cross-marketing opportunities among our drill tool product offerings.
 
New Product Development and Intellectual Property
 
Our sales and earnings are influenced by our ability to successfully provide the high-level service and state-of-the-art products that our customers demand, which in turn relies on our ability to develop new processes, technology, and products. We have also historically dedicated additional resources toward the development of new technology and equipment to enhance the effectiveness, safety, and efficiency of the products and services we provide. We expect that with our extensive knowledge and experience in the oilfield industry, we can identify additional challenges with directional drilling, and then design and develop tools that will help our customers with their drilling challenges. Further development of additional drill string components will become increasingly important to our business as we continue to grow through both organic expansion and strategic acquisitions.
 
Research and development costs were approximately $436,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with $487,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Costs included in research and development include payroll for engineers, materials for the Strider technology, and third-party engineering costs. Research and development costs represented less than approximately 2% and 4% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Legal costs relating to our patents are not included in research and development costs.
 
Although we highly value our proprietary products and technology, we also depend on our technological capabilities, customer service-oriented culture, and application of our know-how to distinguish ourselves from our competitors. We also consider the services and products we provide to our customers, our customer relationships, and the technical knowledge and skill of our personnel, to be more important than our registered intellectual property in our ability to compete. While we stress the importance of our research and development programs, the technical challenges and market uncertainties associated with the development and successful introduction of new and updated products are such that we cannot assure investors that we will realize any particular amount of future revenue from the services and related products resulting from our research and development programs.
 
Suppliers and Raw Materials
 
We acquire supplies, component parts, products and raw materials from suppliers, including steel suppliers, foundries, forge shops and original equipment manufacturers. The prices we pay for our raw materials may be affected by, among other things, energy, industrial diamond, steel and other commodity prices, tariffs and duties on imported materials and foreign currency exchange rates. Certain of our component parts, products or specific raw materials are only available from a limited number of suppliers. Costs have increased from impacts of inflation and supply chain restraints.
 
Our ability to obtain suitable quality raw materials and components, such as PDC’s, steel and flux, solder and heating elements, is critical to our ability to remanufacture Baker Hughes drill bits, and to manufacture the Drill-N-Ream tool and Strider technology tools and other future drilling products. In order to purchase raw materials and components in timely and cost-effective manner, we have developed both domestic and international sourcing connections and arrangements. We maintain quality assurance and testing programs to analyze and test these raw materials and components in order to assure their compliance with our rigorous specifications and standards. We generally try to purchase our raw materials from multiple suppliers, so we are not dependent on any one supplier, but this is not always possible. 
 
The price and availability of commodities and components, in particular steel, can have an impact on our operations. We have no assurance that we will be able to continue to purchase these raw materials on a timely basis or at historical prices.

Proprietary Rights
 
We rely primarily on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, confidential procedures, and other intellectual property protection methods to protect our proprietary technology. Mr. Meier currently has U.S. patent applications pending, and related international patent applications pending as co-inventor, and individually with respect to the Strider technology and other pending drilling tools. There is no assurance that our patent applications will result in issued patents, that the existing patents or that any future patents issued to us will provide any competitive advantages for their products or technology, or that, if challenged, the patents issued to us will be held valid and enforceable. Despite our precautions, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Existing intellectual property laws afford only limited protection and policing violations of such laws is difficult. The laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be used by our customers do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. There is no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology, gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary information, or design around our patents.
 
We may be required to enter into costly litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend infringement claims by others. Such infringement claims could require us to license the intellectual property rights of third parties. There is no assurance that such licenses would be available on reasonable terms, or at all.
 
Competition
 
Drill Bit Refurbishing. The primary competitors for our drill bit refurbishing services are the in-house units at Hughes Christensen, the division of Baker Hughes responsible for drill bits. Other drill bit manufacturers also have in-house refurbishing units and are now competitors given the removal of the exclusivity clause under our contract with Baker Hughes.
 
Drilling Enhancement Tools. The primary competitors for our Drill-N-Ream tool are several single-section reaming tool manufacturers, including Baker Oil Tools (a division of Baker Hughes), NOV, Schlumberger and Tercel, and one dual-section reaming tool manufactured by Stabil Drill (which is the subject of the lawsuit described in Item 3). We believe that the Drill-N-Ream tool is the only patented dual-section or dual cutting structure drill string reamer on the market today. We believe that distinction will allow us to continue building on the Drill-N-Ream tool’s first-mover advantage.
 
We believe that our Strider technology is at the forefront of drill string tool technological development for horizontal drilling. There are existing tools that would compete with our Strider technology, such as the Agitator tool marketed by NOV. However, we believe our Strider technology offers significant advantages over the Agitator tool.
 
Customers
 
Our customer concentration of revenue is dependent upon a limited number of customers. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, two customers represented 88% and 87% of our total revenue, respectively.
Manufacturing
 
We manufacture our solutions, as well as custom products, in our state-of-the-art drill tool fabrication facility where we operate a technologically advanced PDC drill bit refurbishing facility, as well as a state-of-the-art, high-tech drilling and completion tool engineering design and manufacturing operation. We manufacture our drill string enhancement tools, including the patented Drill-N-Ream tool and the patented Strider technology, and conduct our new product research and development from this facility.
 
We employ a senior work force with specialized training and extensive experience related to drill bit refurbishing and drill and completion tool manufacturing. They produce our products and services using a suite of highly technical, purpose-built equipment, much of which we design and manufacture for our proprietary use. Our manufacturing equipment and products use advanced technologies that enable us to increase efficiency, enhance product integrity, improve efficiency and safety, and solve complex drilling tool problems.
 
In December 2020, we were awarded the AS9100D with ISO 9001:2015 certification for our quality management systems (QMS) and for meeting QMS requirements specific to the aviation, space and defense industries. To date we have maintained our certification.
 
We believe that we can leverage our certification as well as our precision machining and manufacturing expertise to produce other products for customers in a variety of industries.

Cyclicality
 
We are substantially dependent on conditions in the oil and gas industry, including the level of exploration, development and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies.
 
The level of exploration, development and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices, which have historically been volatile, and by capital spending discipline imposed by customers.
 
Inflationary and/or recessionary factors relating to the oil and gas industry may directly affect the Company’s operations. The increased demand for oil and gas production has benefited the Company’s operations. The Company is not immune to the effects of inflation on its labor requirements, supply chain and costs of revenues.
 
The Russia – Ukraine conflict is a global concern. The Company does not have any direct exposure to Russia or Ukraine through its operations, employee base, investments or sanctions. The Company does not receive goods or services sourced from those countries, does not anticipate any disruption in its supply chain and has no business relationships, connections to or assets in Russia, Belarus or Ukraine. No impairments to assets have been made due to the conflict. The global oil industry has been impacted by this situation, but the Company’s operations and business in the Middle East has not been disrupted to date. The increase in oil producing activities in the United States has benefitted the Company’s operations.
 
Declines in oil and gas prices could negatively affect the level of these activities and capital spending, which could adversely affect demand for our products and services and, in certain instances, result in the cancellation, modification or rescheduling of existing and expected orders and the ability of our customers to pay us for our products and services. These factors could have an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. Conversely, increases in oil and gas prices could positively affect production activities and capital spending, which could positively affect demand for our products and services.
 
Seasonality
 
Our business is not significantly impacted by seasonality, although our fourth quarter has historically been negatively impacted by holidays and our clients’ budget cycles. A small portion of the revenue we generate from selected operations may benefit from higher first quarter activity levels, as operators take advantage of the winter freeze to gain access to remote drilling and production areas. In the past, some of our revenue in Alaska and Canada has declined during the second quarter due to warming weather conditions that resulted in thawing, softer ground, difficulty accessing drill sites and road bans that curtailed drilling activity.
Environmental, Health and Safety Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to numerous stringent and complex laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment, health and safety aspects of our operations, or otherwise relating to human health and environmental protection, and we have put a strong focus on these issues.
 
We designed and built our Vernal facility as a fully-contained business park, except for the city sewer connection. Underlying our entire facility, including parking lots and runoff storage areas, is a complete capture and containment field that collects all building drainage and ground run off in isolated tanks. Captured drainage and runoff, as well as all hazardous waste generated in our manufacturing processes is regularly removed from our facility by a certified hazardous waste disposal company. Any changes in environmental laws and regulations or in enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal, or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position. Moreover, accidental releases or spills of regulated substances may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations or to obtain or comply with permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of remedial or corrective action requirements, and the imposition of orders or injunctions to prohibit or restrict certain activities or force future compliance.
 
The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance could have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.
 
Hazardous Substances and Waste. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the EPA, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. We are required to manage hazardous and non-hazardous wastes in compliance with RCRA and its state counterparts.

-

 

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, imposes joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. We currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for manufacturing and other operations for many years. We also contract with waste removal services and landfills. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes, remediate contaminated property, or perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment.
 
Water Discharges. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into “Waters of the United States,” including wetlands. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. A responsible party includes the owner or operator of a facility from which a discharge occurs. The Clean Water Act and analogous state laws provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges and, together with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, impose rigorous requirements for spill prevention and response planning, as well as substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation, and damages in connection with any unauthorized discharges. Further, proposed revisions to the definition of “Waters of the United States” have been subject to judicial challenges and administrative action, resulting in uncertainty as to the scope of the regulatory definition. Our obligations under the Clean Water Act could be expanded when the definition of “Waters of the United States” is ultimately resolved.
 
Employee Health and Safety. We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including OSHA and comparable state statutes, establishing requirements to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used, stored, produced or released in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public. Substantial fines and penalties can be imposed and orders or injunctions limiting or prohibiting certain operations may be issued in connection with any failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety.
 
In addition, on January 20, 2021, the Biden Administration came into office and immediately issued a number of executive orders related to environmental matters that could affect our operations and those of our customers, including an Executive Order on “Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis” seeking to adopt new regulations and policies to address climate change and suspend, revise, or rescind, prior agency actions that are identified as conflicting with the Biden Administration’s climate policies. The Biden Administration has also issued other orders that could ultimately affect our business and the business of our customers, such as the executive order rejoining the Paris Agreement, and could seek, in the future, to put into place additional executive orders, policy and regulatory reviews, and seek to have Congress pass legislation that could adversely affect the production of oil and gas assets and our operations and those of our customers. New legislation, regulations or international agreements in the future could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities, capital expenditures to install new emission controls at our facilities, and costs to administer and manage any potential greenhouse gas emissions or carbon trading or tax programs. These costs and capital expenditures could be material. Although the Company has not incurred additional costs due to new policies to date, these developments could increase our costs, reduce the demand for crude oil and condensate, NGLs, and natural gas, and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities.
 
Insurance and Risk Management
 
We maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary and reasonable for companies of our size and with similar operations. In accordance with industry practice, however, we do not maintain insurance coverage against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed. Therefore, there is a risk our insurance program may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or all losses.
 
Currently, our insurance program includes, among other things, general liability, umbrella liability, sudden and accidental pollution, personal property, vehicle, workers’ compensation, directors and officers and employer’s liability coverage. Our insurance includes various limits and deductibles or retentions, which must be met prior to or in conjunction with recovery.
