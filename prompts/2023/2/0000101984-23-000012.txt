•optimizing, scaling and improving our cloud platform to deliver additional features and managed services to a large installed base of customer and end users.
During 2022, our advanced engineering efforts focused on further developing our existing products, services and technologies. We released software updates to our embedded QuickSet application, and continued development initiatives around existing and emerging technologies, such as Rf4CE, Bluetooth, Bluetooth Smart WiFi and Matter, a unifying, IP-based connectivity protocol built on proven technologies designed to connect smart home devices reliably and securely across disparate IoT ecosystems. We continue to enhance the capabilities of our service platform (UEI Virtual Agent) for easier device onboarding, identification and troubleshooting across our portfolio of control products.
As a contributor to the Matter specification, we were an active participant in several working groups and Plugfest events to help bring the full interoperability potential of the Matter standard to market in 2022. Our knowledge of what Matter can (and cannot) deliver has culminated in our introduction of four Matter-certified and capable solutions including QuickSet, QuickSet Widget, Nevo® Butler and UEI TIDE Dial, which were introduced in January 2023 at the International Consumer Electronics Show.
In general, our technical staff are involved in various industry organizations and bodies, which are in the process of setting standards for IR and RF communication and networking in the home. Our participation ensures comprehensive understanding of the technical specifications being developed that can affect the deployment and proliferation of future standards and technologies in the home.
Because of the nature of research and development ("R&D") activities, there can be no assurance that any of our R&D projects will be successfully completed or ultimately achieve commercial success.
Intellectual Property and Technology
A key factor in creating products and software for control of entertainment and smart home devices is our proprietary device knowledge. Each year our device control library continues to grow across AV and smart home platforms, supporting many common smart home protocols, including IR, HDMI-CEC, Bluetooth and its variants, Zigbee (Rf4CE), Z-Wave, Thread, Matter and IP networks.
We have developed a broad portfolio of patented technologies and the industry's leading database of device setup and control software. We ship integrated circuits, on which our software and control code libraries are embedded and that connect to our cloud services, directly to manufacturers for inclusion in their products. In addition, we license our software and technology to manufacturers. 
Our technology also includes other remote controlled home entertainment devices and home automation control modules, as well as wired CEC and wireless IP control protocols commonly found on many of the latest HDMI and internet connected devices. Our proprietary software automatically detects, identifies and enables the appropriate control commands for many home entertainment and automation devices in the home. Our libraries are continuously updated with device control codes used in newly introduced AV and IoT devices. These control codes are captured directly from original control devices or from the manufacturers' written specifications to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the library.
Smart devices are becoming a more prevalent part of the home entertainment experience, and we offer several solutions to enable entertainment device control via smart phones, tablets, smart TVs, smart speakers or digital assistants. In our smart device control solutions, we offer the elements needed for device control ranging from IR and RF controller chips to IP-device control libraries to graphical and voice user interfaces, as well as artificial intelligence systems that deliver context aware device interactions. 
We hold and apply for patents in the United States and abroad related to our remote control, home security, safety, climate control, and automation technologies. Our patents have remaining lives ranging from one to 18 years. We have also obtained copyright registration and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and libraries of our device control codes. Additionally, the names of many of our products are registered, or are being registered, as trademarks in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in most of the other countries in which such products are sold. These registrations are valid for terms ranging up to 20 years and may be renewed as long as the trademarks continue to be used and are deemed by management to be important to our operations. While we follow the practice of obtaining patent, copyright and trademark registrations on new developments whenever advisable, in certain cases we have elected common law trade secret protection in lieu of obtaining such other protection.
Manufacturing and Supply
We currently operate vertically integrated manufacturing and assembly factories in the PRC, Mexico and Brazil, which allows us to produce in the regional markets and to scale our production to meet growing demand. We also use selected third-party manufacturers and suppliers in Asia. 
Our long-term factory planning strategy is to de-risk our reliance on a PRC-based supply chain by (1) reducing our manufacturing concentration in the PRC, (2) pursuing lower cost jurisdictions for manufacturing to help ensure market competitive products and (3) offering customers a flexible and globally diverse manufacturing footprint to provide a reliable and cost-efficient supply chain. To this end, in 2022, we leased factory space in Vietnam and expect to commence manufacturing operations in 2023, pending approval of local government permits and licenses. Construction is complete on the facility, with equipment installed. We are beginning to hire key members of the staff to train in anticipation of commencing manufacturing operations, and while the opening of this factory may result in manufacturing inefficiencies, we are evaluating our manufacturing footprint with the expectation that once the Vietnam factory is operating efficiently, we will reduce our manufacturing capacity, most likely, by shutting down an existing facility. We are analyzing various scenarios, each contingent on the success of the new Vietnam factory, and have yet to conclude on a specific plan. 
Even though we operate three factories in the PRC, manufacturing and assembly plants in Mexico and Brazil, respectively, and plan to open a manufacturing facility in Vietnam in 2023, we continue to evaluate additional third-party manufacturers and sources of supply. During 2022, we utilized multiple third-party manufacturers and maintained duplicate tooling for certain of our products. Where possible, we utilize standard parts and components, which are available from multiple sources. 
We are a large consumer of integrated circuits, including low-power, RF chips and modules that are used throughout our product portfolios. We continually seek additional sources to reduce our dependence on our integrated circuit suppliers. To further manage our integrated system on a chip supplier dependence, we include microcontroller technology which incorporates non-volatile, reprogrammable flash memory in most of our products. Flash memory-based microcontrollers have shorter lead times than microcontrollers using other memory technologies and may be reprogrammed. This allows us flexibility to use a given component on many different products, has the added benefit of potentially reducing excess and obsolete inventory exposure and allows us to update our product functionality in the field. This diversification lessens our dependence on any one supplier and allows us to negotiate more favorable terms. Our largest integrated circuit supplier, Qorvo International Pte Ltd., provided 11.5%, 11.8% and 14.2% of our total inventory purchases in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
Our manufacturing process consists of plastic injection molding, keypad molding, coating or painting, surface mount technology, assembly, software installation, functional testing, packaging, and quality control. We conduct operations utilizing a formal, documented quality management system to ensure that our products and services satisfy customer needs and expectations. Our manufacturing facilities are certified to the ISO 9001:2015 International Standard for quality management. Testing and quality control are applied to components, parts, sub-assemblies and systems obtained from third-party suppliers. Our manufacturing facilities in Mexico and in Yangzhou, PRC are also certified to the TL 9000 Standard, which is the telecom industry's unique extension to ISO 9001:2015. Our manufacturing facilities are certified to the ISO 14001:2015 International Standard for environmental management systems. In addition, our manufacturing facilities in Yangzhou, PRC have also achieved ISO 45001 International Standard for safety and health management systems. Our facilities located in Yangzhou, PRC and Monterrey, Mexico have successfully completed the Validated Audit Process ("VAP") with the Responsible Business Alliance ("RBA"), the world's largest industry coalition dedicated to responsible business conduct in global supply chains, with both factories achieving Silver Status from the RBA. 
We are focused on reducing the environmental impact of our operations. We are evaluating the use of renewable energy and our teams continue to examine practices and processes throughout our facilities to identify opportunities for greater efficiency. Each of our manufacturing facilities has standing policies and targets for the monitoring and management of waste generation and energy consumption, and is focused on reducing electricity consumption, water usage and greenhouse gas emissions. 
We are in our second year of membership with the RBA. We joined as an "affiliate" member in 2021 and were elevated to "regular" membership in 2022. We embrace and support the vision, mission, and goals of the RBA. This is outlined further in our website: https://www.uei.com/corporate-responsibilities. Through the RBA program, we have access to a range of RBA training and assessment tools to support continual improvement in our social, environmental and ethical responsibilities of our supply chains. We follow the RBA guidelines for supplier risk assessments process by requiring our suppliers of raw materials and components to complete the full RBA self-assessment questionnaire ("SAQ") and to conduct an on-site VAP audit for 50% of any identified high-risk major suppliers. In addition to observance of quality standards from our suppliers, we maintain and request our suppliers to adhere to our Global Supplier Code of Conduct and Fair Competition Policy ("Supplier Code of Conduct"), which is available on our website and is an essential part of our supply chain management.
Further, our Supplier Code of Conduct sets forth our global expectations that we have in the areas of fair dealing, legal compliance, business integrity, labor practices, health and safety, and environmental management. In particular, we require our suppliers to respect basic human rights and to not engage in any involuntary or forced labor and to fully comply with all laws and regulations pertaining to the appropriate and dignified treatment of all workers. In addition, we adhere to, and require suppliers to adhere to the RBA Code of Conduct, which among other things prohibits the use of forced labor in any manner. To better enforce a zero-tolerance of forced labor, we provide training to our employees to identify signs of forced labor and other unlawful labor practices and how to report it directly to management or use our global ethics "whistleblower" line.
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
Many of our products are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws governing chemical substances in products, including laws regulating the manufacturing and distribution of chemical substances and laws restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products. We may incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party damages, or personal injury claims, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws. We also face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the material composition of our products.
We may also face significant costs and liabilities in connection with product take-back legislation. The European Union's Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment ("WEEE") Directive makes producers of electrical goods financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment, and disposal of past and future covered products. Our European subsidiaries are WEEE compliant. 
We believe that we have materially complied with all currently existing international and domestic federal, state and local statutes and regulations regarding environmental standards and occupational safety and health matters to which we are subject. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the costs incurred in complying with federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations pertaining to environmental standards and occupational safety and health laws and regulations did not materially affect our earnings, financial condition or competitive position. In addition, during the same period, the costs incurred in complying with other applicable government regulations likewise did not materially affect our earnings, financial condition or competitive position. However, due to the heightened awareness of corporate environmental, social and governance ("ESG") matters and evolving laws and regulations or enforcement policies, increases in compliance costs may have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or financial condition.
Our operations, supply chain and products are expected to become increasingly subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and international treaties relating to climate change, such as climate disclosure, carbon pricing or product energy efficiency requirements. We strive to continually improve the energy and carbon efficiency of our operations, supply chain and product portfolio and deliver more cost-effective and lower carbon technology solutions to our customers. We believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to achieve compliance with and manage those requirements.
We are committed to reducing and eliminating substances of concern from our products and manufacturing process. Our products distributed in the European Union are compliant with the RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive 2011/65/EU and 2015/863/EU) and REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) directives. In other regions, we also need to comply with our customers' specific requirements relating to the non-use of certain hazardous substances in the products, which are typically equally or more stringent than the RoHS directive. We have a dedicated "Green Team," based in the PRC and comprised of engineers and environmental regulation experts, that analyze our products, processes, and raw materials to help ensure that we comply with environmental and government regulations worldwide, as well as the applicable "Green" requirements imposed by our customers. Additionally, we have in-house testing capability to help ensure product compliance. In response to and to comply with certain National Standards published by the Chinese government, our Green Team has been working proactively for the identification and reduction of volatile organic compounds ("VOCs") within our supply chain. We place great importance on the compliance with local health and safety laws and regulations. At our manufacturing facilities, we are also committed to protecting our workers from exposure to hazardous substances under an established health and safety management system: As an example, we have replaced VOC emitting inks and paints with reduced-VOC paints at our PRC facilities.
We strive to extend the useful life of our products and reduce our products' impact on the environment. We have invested in R&D to improve the energy efficiency of our battery-operated products: For example, we deploy a low energy IR-engine in some of our products, which can extend battery life regardless of the protocols utilized by the product. We have introduced our control platform and related technologies that address the growing demand for sustainable products that reduce energy use and eliminate waste. With this platform, we partnered with technology leaders and invested in bringing ultra-low power connectivity chips with built-in energy harvesting and photovoltaic cells to the market. These chips offer more computing power while consuming substantially less battery power. In addition, to reduce energy consumption even further, we are actively working on solutions powered by low-light solar cells for the entertainment remote control and IoT markets. 
We also offer a product refurbishment program to our customers where we reclaim, refurbish and recycle pre-owned remote controls. Under this program, major components in pre-owned remote control units are reused or recycled; for example, the printed circuit board assemblies ("PCBA") are cleaned, tested and reused, or plastics are reground to be reused. We have also employed new master carton packing methods to increase shipping efficiency and reduce cardboard usage. Some of our manufacturing facilities are switching to the use of recycled solder. To further reduce collateral waste, we have introduced an initiative to reduce and/or remove single use plastics ("SUP") from our supply chain and manufacturing process for certain customer programs.
In the nations where we have operations or otherwise conduct business, we are also subject to tariffs, import/export controls, and other trade-related laws and limitations. These limits, regulations, and tariffs, especially those pertaining to or affecting relations between the United States and the PRC, might significantly disrupt our business, affecting our capacity to manufacture, source components and sell goods.
Government regulations are subject to change; therefore, we are unable to predict the impact of complying with potential future requirements or whether doing so will materially affect our operations, financial situation, or business.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 4,658 members of staff across our worldwide facilities. Of this staff, 3,383 are associated with our manufacturing and supply chain organizations in the PRC, Mexico and Brazil. Beyond the manufacturing and supply chain organizations, 844 of staff work in engineering and R&D, 130 in sales, marketing, consumer service and support and 301 in executive and administrative functions.

Since the fourth quarter of 2021, these third-party agencies have been required to adhere to our Supplier Code of Conduct, which among other things, prohibits the use of forced labor and sets forth requirements on fair dealing, legal compliance, business integrity, labor practices, health and safety and environmental management.
We provide and maintain a work environment that is designed to attract, develop and retain top talent through offering our employees an engaging work experience that contributes to their career development. We recognize that our success is based on the collective talents and dedication of those we employ. Talent management is critical to our ability to execute our long-term growth strategy, and we utilize both internal human resource personnel and external recruiting firms to identify and attract such talent. Through our history of technological innovation, we appreciate the importance of retention, growth and development of our employees. We regularly collect feedback from employees to better understand and improve their experiences and identify opportunities to continually strengthen our culture. Due to the nature of our activities, we tend to heavily invest in engineering capital, employing highly skilled and specialized engineers and technicians in the areas of electronics, RF design, software, cloud, mechanical, industrial design, manufacturing and quality disciplines.
