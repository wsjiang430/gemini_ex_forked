 Overview
 We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel therapies for rare endocrine disorders with significant unmet medical need. We are initially developing our wholly-owned product candidate, tildacerfont, as the potential first non-steroidal therapy to offer markedly improved disease control and reduce steroid burden for patients suffering from classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Classic CAH is a serious and life-threatening disease with no known novel therapies approved in approximately 70 years. In a 12-week Phase 2a proof-of-concept clinical trial, tildacerfont-treated adult patients suffering from classic CAH who had elevated adrenal hormones at baseline despite being on standard of care therapy achieved approximately 80% reductions in hormones that are key indicators of poorly controlled disease. Furthermore, over 200 subjects across eight completed clinical trials to date have been administered tildacerfont with no drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs) reported.
 We have initiated CAHmelia-203, a placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2b clinical trial in adult patients with classic CAH with highly elevated levels of androstenedione (A4) at baseline and anticipate topline results in the second half of 2023. We have also initiated CAHmelia-204, a second Phase 2b clinical trial in adult patients with classic CAH on supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids with normal or near normal levels of A4 at baseline focused on glucocorticoid reduction and anticipate topline results in the second half of 2024. Based on post-hoc analyses of our clinical data to date, we have chosen to target two distinct groups of classic CAH patients with either supraphysiologic daily glucocorticoids with normal or near normal levels of A4 at baseline or highly elevated levels of A4 at baseline. A4 is an androgen steroid routinely used as a biomarker of androgen synthesis by the adrenal gland. These two groups, which together make up the entire classic CAH patient population, have differing disease challenges centered on excessive adrenal hormone levels or excessive glucocorticoid usage, both of which have the potential to be addressed by treatment with tildacerfont, if approved. We believe our strategy to study CAH patients in these two enriched sub-populations may enable us to observe clinically meaningful outcomes. Additionally, we believe these two clinical trials will provide sufficient patient exposures for our registrational safety database, which are designed to potentially support registration in the United States and Europe. Assuming positive results from these clinical trials, we plan to meet with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and certain comparable foreign regulatory authorities to discuss potential registration.
 Classic CAH is an autosomal recessive disease, driven by a mutation in the gene that encodes an enzyme necessary for the synthesis of key adrenal hormones. In classic CAH patients, the body is not able to produce cortisol, leading to serious health consequences. In the absence of cortisol, patients can face adrenal crisis and death rapidly as a result of any stressing event, such as infection. Physicians administer replacement steroid hormones to reduce the risk of adrenal crises and death; however, replacement alone is not sufficient to address all of the consequences associated with classic CAH.
 The absence of cortisol alters the normal feedback cycle of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and leads to excess secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), hyperplasia of the adrenal gland, and consequently high levels of endogenous androgen production. As a result, classic CAH patients suffer from premature puberty, impaired fertility, hirsutism, acne, the development of adrenal rest tumors, and an impaired quality of life, and additionally for females, virilized genitalia and menstrual irregularities. Currently, the only way to downregulate the production of excess androgens in classic CAH patients is to administer even higher doses of glucocorticoids, known as supraphysiologic glucocorticoid dosing. These elevated dose levels present specific side effects, including increased risks of developing diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stunted growth, osteoporosis, thin skin, gastrointestinal disorders, and decreased lifespan.
 Due to the severity of the disease, most developed countries have established newborn screening programs to test for classic CAH at birth. Infants diagnosed with classic CAH are generally initiated on glucocorticoid therapy at the time of diagnosis and lifelong disease management with steroids is required, with pediatric patients generally transitioning into the care of adult endocrinologists between the ages of 18 and 21. Due to the complexity of management of classic CAH, in the United States, patients are generally managed within specialty endocrinology clinics, and in the European Union (EU), most countries have a small number of centers of excellence addressing the population. We estimate the total classic CAH populations are approximately 20,000 to 30,000 people in the United

States and approximately 50,000 people in the EU, and, according to the National Organization for Rare Disorders, the estimated incidence of classic CAH in the United States and Europe is between one in 10,000 and one in 15,000 live births. In addition, we estimate based on industry reports that the global market opportunity in patients with classic CAH is at least approximately $3.0 billion.
 Tildacerfont is a potent and highly selective, non-steroidal, oral antagonist of the CRF1 receptor, which is the receptor for corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), a hormone that is secreted by the hypothalamus. The CRF1 receptor is abundantly expressed in the pituitary gland where it is the primary regulator of the HPA axis. By blocking the CRF1 receptor, tildacerfont has the potential to address the uncontrolled cortisol feedback regulatory pathway in CAH, and in turn reduce the production of ACTH in the pituitary, limiting the amount of androgen produced downstream from the adrenal gland. We believe that by controlling excess adrenal androgens through an independent mechanism, tildacerfont could reduce the unwanted clinical symptoms associated with high androgen exposure. Tildacerfont use could also enable treating physicians to lower the supraphysiologic glucocorticoid doses given to classic CAH patients to near physiologic levels, thus reducing or avoiding the long-term and serious side effects associated with the chronic use of high dose glucocorticoids.
 Tildacerfont has been evaluated in over 200 subjects across eight completed clinical trials in which it has been generally well tolerated. No drug-related SAEs have been reported related to tildacerfont treatment. To date, we have completed two Phase 2 clinical trials in patients with classic CAH, comprising of a two-week proof-of-mechanism dose ranging clinical trial, and a 12-week proof-of-concept clinical trial, in which we observed that tildacerfont led to the decrease in the levels of a series of hormones associated with adrenal hyperplasia and androgen synthesis, both of which are key indicators of poorly controlled disease. In our 12-week clinical trial, among patients with highly elevated levels of adrenal hormones at baseline, 60% achieved normalization of ACTH, one subject at week two prior to discontinuation and two subjects during month three, and 40% achieved normalization of A4 during month three.
Through our clinical trials completed to date, we have conducted post-hoc analyses of two distinct groups of classic CAH patients, both on stable standard-of-care glucocorticoids: those who have highly elevated levels of A4 at baseline; and those on supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids with normal or near normal levels of A4 at baseline. In patients with highly elevated levels of adrenal hormones at baseline, we believe that the dose of glucocorticoids being administered was insufficient on its own to suppress adrenal hyperplasia and androgen synthesis. Patients with poorly controlled disease may be intolerant to higher glucocorticoid doses or unwilling to accept the negative consequences resulting from chronic use of high doses of glucocorticoids. In patients with highly elevated levels of adrenal hormones at baseline, the addition of tildacerfont provided a potential non-steroidal solution to control excess androgen synthesis. Patients receiving tildacerfont showed reduced levels of disease-driving hormones by a mean of approximately 80%, resulting in levels close to those found in healthy adults without any changes to the glucocorticoid dosing in these patients.
 We observed that classic CAH patients in our clinical trials on supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids with normal or near normal levels of A4 at baseline upon trial enrollment were receiving glucocorticoid doses approximately 44% higher than those patients with highly elevated levels of adrenal hormones at baseline. Dosing of tildacerfont in patients on supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids with normal or near normal levels of A4 at baseline was well tolerated and did not lead to further suppression of adrenal function or androgen synthesis. In these patients, tildacerfont may be able to allow a significant reduction in glucocorticoid dosing while continuing to maintain normal levels of androgens. Based on the strength of our clinical results to date, we believe tildacerfont has the potential to offer improved clinical outcomes for all classic CAH patients.
 In addition, we are investigating tildacerfont for the treatment of classic CAH in children. We believe there is a significant medical need to provide androgen-lowering and glucocorticoid-sparing therapies to pediatric classic CAH patients to reduce the risk of premature puberty and the adverse effects of glucocorticoids, including growth inhibition and short-stature as adults. We have initiated CAHptain, a Phase 2 open-label clinical trial, which will utilize a sequential three cohort design, to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of tildacerfont in children two to 17 years of age with classic CAH. We anticipate topline data from adolescents (cohorts 1 and 2) of the Phase 2 open-label clinical trial in the second half of 2023.
We own worldwide development and commercialization rights for tildacerfont. We intend to build a highly specialized commercial organization to support the commercialization of tildacerfont, if approved, in the United States. Given a relatively small number of endocrinologists and specialists treat a large proportion of the patients with classic CAH, we believe this market can be effectively addressed with a modest-sized targeted commercial

sales force, alongside various high-touch patient initiatives. If tildacerfont is approved for additional indications, we plan to leverage our rare disease commercial infrastructure and expertise to efficiently address those patient populations. We plan to seek strategic collaborations to benefit from the resources of biopharmaceutical companies specialized in either relevant disease areas or geographies in markets outside the United States. In January 2023, we and Kaken Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd (Kaken) entered into an exclusive licensing agreement for the development and commercialization of tildacerfont for the treatment of CAH in Japan. Under the terms of the agreement, we will receive an upfront payment of $15.0 million from Kaken and will be eligible to receive additional payments upon the achievement of future development and commercial milestones, as well as tiered double-digit royalties on net sales in Japan. Kaken will be responsible for the clinical development and commercialization of tildacerfont in Japan, and we will retain all rights to tildacerfont in all other geographies. Kaken will also be responsible for securing and maintaining regulatory approvals necessary to market and sell tildacerfont in Japan.
 We have developed and continue to expand our extensive patent portfolio for tildacerfont, covering composition of matter, method of synthesis, formulation, and use. We have also been granted orphan drug designation for tildacerfont for the treatment of CAH both in the United States and the EU. We have assembled a highly experienced team with broad capabilities in drug discovery, development, and commercialization. Javier Szwarcberg, M.D., MPH, our Chief Executive Officer, previously served as Group Vice President and Head of Program and Portfolio Development for BioMarin Pharmaceuticals. Previously, he held positions as Senior Vice President, Head of Program and Portfolio Management at Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical and Vice President of R&D and Business Development at Horizon Pharma. Samir Gharib, our President and Chief Financial Officer, previously served as Chief Financial Officer at Stemedica Cell Technologies and prior to that in executive finance roles at Revance Therapeutics, Inc. and Talon Therapeutics, Inc.
Our Development Plan for Tildacerfont
 We are investigating tildacerfont in orphan indications where the underlying disease biology supports a need to reduce excess secretion of or hyperresponsiveness to ACTH. We are currently in late-stage clinical development for tildacerfont in adult patients with classic CAH. We have initiated the CAHmelia-203 trial in adult patients with classic CAH with highly elevated levels of A4 at baseline and anticipate topline results in the second half of 2023. We have also initiated the CAHmelia-204 trial in adult patients with classic CAH on supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids with normal or near normal levels of A4 at baseline focused on glucocorticoid reduction and anticipate topline results in the second half of 2024. Based on analyses of our clinical data to date, we have chosen to target two distinct groups of classic CAH patients with either supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids with normal or near normal levels of A4 at baseline or highly elevated levels of A4 at baseline. These two groups, which together make up the entire classic CAH patient population, have differing disease challenges centered on excessive adrenal androgen levels or excessive glucocorticoid usage, both of which have the potential to be addressed by treatment with tildacerfont, if approved. We believe our strategy to study CAH patients in these two enriched sub-populations may enable us to observe clinically meaningful outcomes. Additionally, we believe these two clinical trials will provide sufficient patient exposures for our registrational safety database. Assuming positive results from these clinical trials, we plan to meet with the FDA and certain comparable foreign regulatory authorities to discuss potential registration.
 We are also investigating tildacerfont for the treatment of classic CAH in children. We believe there is a significant medical need to provide androgen-lowering and glucocorticoid-sparing therapies to pediatric classic CAH patients to reduce the risk of premature puberty and the adverse effects of glucocorticoids, including growth inhibition and short-stature as adults. We have initiated CAHptain, a Phase 2 open-label clinical trial, which will utilize a sequential three cohort design, to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of tildacerfont in children two to 17 years of age with classic CAH. We anticipate topline data from adolescents (cohorts 1 and 2) of the Phase 2 open-label clinical trial in the second half of 2023. We have also submitted a PIP to PDCO of the EMA regarding a registrational program in children with classic CAH. PDCO issued an opinion on its agreement with the proposed PIP of tildacerfont for the treatment of CAH which endorsed the clinical program to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of tildacerfont for the treatment of CAH in patients from one year of age to less than 18 years of age. PDCO also granted a waiver for the treatment of CAH in patients less than one year of age.
 Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder common among females of reproductive age affecting nearly five million females in the United States and approximately 115 million females worldwide. PCOS is characterized by elevated levels of androgens, cysts in the ovaries, and irregular periods. We have identified a subpopulation of patients where elevated levels of adrenal androgens are the cause of disease. We believe that

tildacerfont may present a novel mechanism to reduce ACTH and provide a therapeutic option for females with PCOS and elevated adrenal androgens. By leveraging our existing Phase 1 program, which includes safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of tildacerfont, we have initiated P.O.W.E.R., a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial. The Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose escalation trial which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of tildacerfont titrated to 200mg once daily (QD) compared to placebo at 12 weeks of treatment in subjects with PCOS and elevated adrenal androgens as measured by dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels at baseline. We anticipate topline results from the Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial in the first half of 2023.
 Beyond classic CAH and PCOS, we believe tildacerfont has potential utility in a range of diseases where the underlying biology supports a need to reduce excess secretion of or hyperresponsiveness to ACTH. We are committed to leveraging our deep scientific knowledge of the biology of rare endocrine disorders, the benefits of tildacerfont, and our commercial expertise to dramatically transform the lives of individuals living with these devastating disorders.
 The following summarizes our ongoing clinical trials and anticipated upcoming milestones for tildacerfont:
 

Our Strategy
 ▪Complete clinical development for tildacerfont and seek regulatory approval for the treatment of adults with classic CAH. Our completed Phase 2 clinical trials of tildacerfont in classic CAH patients have demonstrated the potential of tildacerfont to lower ACTH and levels of key steroid precursors for androgen synthesis. We have initiated CAHmelia-203, a placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2b clinical trial in adult patients with classic CAH with highly elevated levels of A4 at baseline and anticipate topline results in the second half of 2023. We have also initiated CAHmelia-204, a second Phase 2b clinical trial in adult patients with classic CAH on supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids with normal or near normal levels of A4 at baseline focused on glucocorticoid reduction and anticipate topline results in the second half of 2024. Based on analyses of our clinical data to date, we have chosen to target two distinct groups of classic CAH patients with either supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids with normal or near normal levels of A4 at baseline or highly elevated levels of A4 at baseline. These two groups, which together make up the entire classic CAH patient population, have differing disease challenges centered on excessive adrenal androgen levels or excessive glucocorticoid usage, both of which have the potential to be addressed by treatment with tildacerfont, if approved. We believe our strategy to study CAH patients in these two enriched sub-populations may enable us to observe clinically meaningful outcomes. Additionally, we believe these two clinical trials will provide sufficient patient exposures for our registrational safety database. Assuming positive results from these clinical trials, we plan to meet with the FDA and certain comparable foreign regulatory authorities to discuss potential registration.


▪Advance tildacerfont through clinical development and seek regulatory approval for the treatment of children with classic CAH. There is an urgent medical need to bring androgen-lowering and glucocorticoid-reduction therapy to pediatric classic CAH patients to avoid premature puberty, which together with the adverse effects of glucocorticoids, can prevent a child from growing to their full height. We have developed a pediatric development plan to assess the safety and efficacy of tildacerfont in patients as young as one year of age. We have initiated CAHptain, a Phase 2 open-label clinical trial, which will utilize a sequential three cohort design, to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of tildacerfont in children two to 17 years of age with classic CAH. We anticipate topline data from adolescents (cohorts 1 and 2) of the Phase 2 open-label clinical trial in the second half of 2023.
 ▪Maximize the commercial potential of tildacerfont in classic CAH. We intend to build a highly specialized commercial organization to support the commercialization of tildacerfont, if approved, in the United States. Given a relatively small number of endocrinologists and specialists treat a large proportion of the patients with classic CAH, we believe this market can be effectively addressed with a modest-sized targeted commercial sales force, alongside various high-touch patient initiatives. If tildacerfont is approved for additional indications, we plan to leverage our rare disorder commercial infrastructure and expertise to efficiently address those patient populations. We plan to seek strategic collaborations to benefit from the resources of biopharmaceutical companies specialized in either relevant disease areas or geographies in markets outside the United States. In January 2023, we and Kaken entered into an exclusive licensing agreement for the development and commercialization of tildacerfont for the treatment of CAH in Japan. Under the terms of the agreement, we will receive an upfront payment of $15.0 million from Kaken and will be eligible to receive additional payments upon the achievement of future development and commercial milestones, as well as tiered double-digit royalties on net sales in Japan. Kaken will be responsible for the clinical development and commercialization of tildacerfont in Japan, and we will retain all rights to tildacerfont in all other geographies. Kaken will also be responsible for securing and maintaining regulatory approvals necessary to market and sell tildacerfont in Japan.
 ▪Explore the potential of tildacerfont to bring therapeutic benefit to patients with other rare endocrine disorders. We believe that tildacerfont has the potential to bring therapeutic benefit to patients suffering from rare endocrine disorders where the underlying disease biology supports a need to reduce excess secretion of or hyperresponsiveness to ACTH. Based on this biological rationale, we believe tildacerfont may have utility in controlling elevated levels of adrenal androgens in a subpopulation of females with PCOS. We believe these patients may potentially benefit from treatment with tildacerfont by reducing their ACTH level and related adrenal androgen production. By leveraging our existing Phase 1 program, which includes safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of tildacerfont, we have initiated P.O.W.E.R., a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial. The Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose escalation trial which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of tildacerfont titrated to 200mg QD compared to placebo at 12 weeks of treatment in subjects with PCOS and elevated adrenal androgens as measured by DHEAS levels at baseline. We will also continue to explore the utility of tildacerfont in other rare endocrine disorders, such as the severe form of non-classic CAH in which there is a strong scientific and clinical rationale. We anticipate topline results from the Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial in the first half of 2023.
 ▪Evaluate strategic opportunities to expand our product candidate portfolio. We intend to seek to in-license or acquire development-stage product candidates in rare endocrine disorders that have the potential to complement our existing portfolio. We believe that there are many opportunities to leverage our deep endocrine expertise to develop new treatments for rare endocrine disorders with significant unmet medical needs.


Role of the Endocrine System and the HPA Axis
 The endocrine system regulates most of the body’s physiological activities through the actions of hormones, which are chemical and biochemical messengers secreted from different organs that influence growth, gastrointestinal function, maturation and development, reproduction, stress, metabolism, and nearly all aspects of homeostasis. The endocrine system includes, among other glands and organs, the pituitary gland, hypothalamus, pancreas, adrenal gland, thyroid and parathyroid, ovaries and testes, as well as specialized enteroendocrine cells. Hormonal secretion is complex and the body employs several mechanisms to exert positive and negative feedback control to maintain homeostasis.
 The HPA axis is a critical component of the endocrine system and the body’s response to stress. In a functioning HPA axis, CRF is synthesized and secreted from the hypothalamus in the brain. This stimulates the secretion of ACTH, through activation of the CRF1 receptor at the pituitary gland, which in turn stimulates the production of several hormones in the adrenal cortex: corticosteroids, which gauge the body’s response to illness or injury; mineralocorticoids, which regulate salt and water levels; and androgens, which are male sex hormones. Cortisol, a glucocorticoid steroid, exerts a negative feedback response at the hypothalamus and pituitary, which decreases secretion of CRF and ACTH, respectively, to maintain an appropriate balance of all three hormones.
 

Figure 1. Normal HPA Axis function.
 Classic CAH Disease Overview
 Classic CAH is a chronic and potentially life-threatening rare disease with no cure. The most common cause of classic CAH, accounting for an estimated 95% of cases, is a genetic mutation leading to the production of dysfunctional 21-hydroxylase, an enzyme necessary for the biosynthesis of both corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids. Patients with classic CAH present with dysregulation across the HPA axis due to this enzymatic deficiency that shuts down the production of corticosteroids and, in approximately 75% of cases, the production of mineralocorticoids.
 


Figure 2. The dysregulation of the HPA axis in classic CAH.
 The immediate goal of treatment is the prevention of adrenal crises by replacing the missing physiological levels of corticosteroids. However, cortisol levels in the body vary daily, and normally increase during periods of high stress, making adequate control very difficult to achieve for most patients. In response to chronically absent or inadequate cortisol levels, the pituitary gland secretes higher levels of ACTH to further stimulate steroid synthesis in the adrenal gland. This results in hyperplasia of the gland and the shunting of the steroid precursors to androgen synthesis, resulting in excess levels of androgens such as testosterone and A4 with overt symptoms of virilization. Therefore, the long-term symptomatic control in these patients is to reduce ACTH through supraphysiological doses of exogenous glucocorticoids via a negative feedback response.
 The consequences of being born with CAH are severe. All patients born with classic CAH have cortisol deficiency, which makes these patients susceptible to adrenal crises in as early as one to four weeks of age. Due to the life-threatening adrenal crisis, screening for classic CAH is a standard part of routine neonatal screening in the United States and many other major geographies around the world. The most common cause of an adrenal crisis is an infection. Adrenal crisis can also be precipitated by other inducers of stress including surgery, dehydration, or trauma, and is characterized by extreme weakness, nausea, and vomiting. To prevent adrenal crises, physiological replacement of glucocorticoids is initiated in the neonatal period. Data from approximately 6.5 million newborn infants screened worldwide show an estimated incidence of approximately one in 15,000 live births.
 Even when patients are diagnosed early and treated with steroids, the associated, continued exposure to high levels of androgens results in premature or precocious puberty, with onset sometimes occurring as early as five years of age. Early puberty drives early maturation of the body’s bones, resulting in an adult height that is typically significantly below the height expected based on the parents’ heights. In females, the presence of excess androgens in the body causes virilization, often leading to ambiguous genitalia and masculinizing features apparent at birth. Female adolescents and adults may develop male-pattern alopecia, acne, hirsutism, menstrual irregularities, and impaired fertility. Often commencing in early adolescence, a substantial proportion of males can develop testicular adrenal rest tumors (TARTs), benign tumors that can lead to pain and impaired fertility.
 Numerous studies have documented diminished quality of life in patients with CAH related both to the disease and its treatment with glucocorticoids. For example, CAH patients commonly experience fatigue, sleep disturbances, concentration problems, and challenges with social interactions.
 Patients with classic CAH face increased risk of mortality, with one study documenting an average reduced lifespan of 6.5 years. The causes of death were adrenal crisis (42%), cardiovascular disease (32%), cancer (16%), and suicide (10%).
 Consequences of Lack of Cortisol and Aldosterone
 A lack of functional 21-hydroxylase enzyme results in the inability to produce sufficient corticosteroids, such as cortisol, and mineralocorticoids, such as aldosterone. Cortisol functions as the body’s main stress hormone. Biochemically, it regulates glucose metabolism, inflammation and blood pressure. On a behavioral level, it controls mood, motivation, fear, and sleep/wake cycles. Aldosterone regulates the electrolyte balance between sodium and potassium in the body. Low levels of aldosterone result in hyponatremia, low blood pressure and volume, dizziness,

and lightheadedness. Restoration of the function of both cortisol and aldosterone is the primary goal of current therapies for classic CAH.
 Consequences of the Accumulation of the Androgen Precursor 17-OHP
 A consequence of the absence of 21-hydroxylase is the accumulation of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), a precursor molecule to androgens and cortisol. Without 21-hydroxylase to convert 17-OHP into cortisol, increased levels of 17-OHP are shunted to an alternative hormone resulting in increased synthesis of the testosterone precursor, A4, and related increases in the levels of other androgens in the body, resulting in virilization that complicates fertility and sexual maturation in both females and males. The following figure depicts steroid treatment intervention in patients with classic CAH.
 

Figure 3. Depiction of steroid treatment intervention in patients with classic CAH.
 Inadequate Regulation of Steroid Synthesis Leading to Androgen Excess
 Cortisol serves as a negative regulator of the HPA axis, regulating its own production. Increasing levels of cortisol downregulate the synthesis of CRF in the hypothalamus and ACTH in the pituitary to ultimately reduce the production of cortisol precursor molecules, such as 17-OHP. In classic CAH patients, deficiencies in cortisol levels stimulate this feedback mechanism and results in excess production of CRF and ACTH. CRF produced in the hypothalamus binds to the CRF1 receptor in the pituitary gland to stimulate the production of ACTH. In turn, ACTH overproduction drives both adrenal hyperplasia, or enlargement of the adrenal glands, and overproduction of steroid molecules such as 17-OHP and A4, leading to increased androgen production. This serves to further exacerbate the excessive levels of androgens in these patients.
Current Treatment Paradigm and its Limitations
 The mainstay of classic CAH therapy for approximately 70 years has been lifelong treatment with glucocorticoids such as hydrocortisone, prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, or dexamethasone. These treatments do not cure the disease, but they serve a two-fold purpose in disease management. Firstly, physiologic levels of glucocorticoids replace the missing cortisol in order to prevent adrenal crisis. Secondly, supraphysiologic levels of glucocorticoids reduce excess androgens through the negative feedback loop alleviating additional hyperandrogenic symptoms.
 The level of glucocorticoid necessary to achieve therapeutic benefit is specific to each patient, requires adjustment to individual patient circumstances, and may change over the patient’s lifetime, thereby creating multiple challenges for effective treatment. Chronic use of glucocorticoids requires careful management, because of the well-known serious side effects of these drugs, which include growth inhibition in children, high blood pressure, diabetes, psychological effects, skin thinning, and increased risks of infections.


Clinical management of classic CAH is a difficult balance between supplying sufficient levels of glucocorticoids to compensate for deficiencies in cortisol levels while minimizing side effects resulting in a narrow therapeutic window. In an analysis of classic CAH patients treated in the United States and the United Kingdom (UK), only one-third of those dosed with glucocorticoids achieved optimal control of their androgen levels. While treatment with supraphysiologic glucocorticoids can help restore the regulation of CRF and ACTH production leading to reductions in excess 17-OHP and A4 synthesis, in order to restore a more appropriate balance, physicians must identify the desired glucocorticoid dose for each patient. This is challenging, because the amount of cortisol needed to modulate 17-OHP and A4 levels is much higher than that required to functionally replace the missing cortisol.
 From birth to adulthood, the aim of glucocorticoid treatment is to identify the right balance based on both the patient’s physical maturation as well as gender. At birth, the aim of treatment is to provide an adequate level of steroids to prevent an adrenal crisis. Throughout childhood, treatment becomes more complex with both a need to maintain adequate steroid levels but also ensure androgen levels are as close to normal to prevent precocious puberty while not stunting growth and to prevent premature closure of bone growth plates as a result of treatment with supraphysiologic steroids. The aim of treatment for adolescents and adults is to provide the body with the ability to maintain a normal energy level, normal growth, and fertility while minimizing clinically overt signs of excess glucocorticoids or excess androgens. In adults, the balancing act may be different between males and females. Females experience more outward signs of excess androgens than males, so females are more attentive to androgen control through supraphysiologic glucocorticoids while males may be more attentive to the adverse outcomes associated with supraphysiologic glucocorticoid replacement.
 This makes glucocorticoid therapy challenging, since treatment with high levels of glucocorticoids leads to, among other consequences, obesity, short stature, the loss of bone mineral density, drug-induced Cushing’s disease, which is a condition that occurs from exposure to high cortisol levels for a long period of time, metabolic disorders, increased cardiovascular and infection risk, and early mortality. The following figure depicts the need to balance the negative consequences that result from excess levels of androgen levels with those associated with high levels of glucocorticoids.
 

Figure 4. The challenge in treating CAH is balancing therapy to provide optimal control of androgens while avoiding excess cortisol levels.
 A novel approach to suppress androgen synthesis would be to directly inhibit the ability of CRF to stimulate ACTH synthesis using a CRF1 receptor antagonist. This approach has the potential to dissociate physiologic cortisol replacement with glucocorticoids from cortisol’s regulatory role as a negative-regulator of ACTH to both prevent the hyperplasia of the adrenal gland and reduce the ensuing excess androgen synthesis. In effect, this is an independent mechanism to block excessive ACTH production. We believe that an effective CRF1receptor antagonist will enable physicians to reduce the dose of glucocorticoids administered to patients in a way that will address their cortisol replacement needs and simultaneously avoid excessive androgen production.


Our Solution, Tildacerfont
 Tildacerfont is a potent and highly selective, non-steroidal, oral, small-molecule antagonist of the CRF1 receptor, a regulator of the production of ACTH. The CRF1 receptor binds CRF, a potent mediator of endocrine, autonomic, behavioral, and immune responses to stress. Activation of the CRF1 receptor in the pituitary gland has been shown to increase the secretion of ACTH, which in turn drives the production of cortisol and androgens in the adrenal gland. By blocking the CRF1 receptor, tildacerfont can address the uncontrolled cortisol feedback regulatory pathway in CAH, and in turn reduce the production of ACTH in the pituitary, limiting the amount of androgen produced downstream from the adrenal gland. Tildacerfont has been assessed in over 200 subjects across eight completed clinical trials, in which it has been well tolerated with no drug-related SAEs. In preclinical studies, we showed that blocking the binding of CRF to this receptor decreased ACTH production and the production of hormones and androgens such as 17-OHP and A4 and that tildacerfont was over 1,000-fold selective for the CRF1 receptor versus any other receptor tested. Based on preclinical data, receptor occupancy of at least 90% was predicted to be achieved at a dose of less than 400mg.
 

Figure 5. Tildacerfont blocks CRF1 receptors at the anterior pituitary gland to decrease secretion of ACTH, hormones, such as 17-OHP, and androgens, such as A4.
 Tildacerfont has been investigated in six completed Phase 1 clinical trials in healthy adult volunteers, in single doses up to 800mg as well as in multiple doses ranging from 50mg to 200mg once daily, for 14 days. In all of these clinical trials, tildacerfont was generally well tolerated. Over 200 healthy volunteers have received at least one dose of tildacerfont in completed studies. No drug-related SAEs during tildacerfont treatment were observed in these clinical trials and the most frequent non-procedural adverse events, defined as events experienced by greater than 5% of the healthy volunteer population was headache.
 Completed Clinical Trials in Classic CAH Patients
 We conducted two Phase 2a clinical trials of tildacerfont in adult patients with classic CAH on stable glucocorticoid therapy. Clinical trial SPR001-201 was an open-label, dose-ranging clinical trial in 24 patients. These patients received a series of doses of tildacerfont for two weeks each in addition to their standard daily glucocorticoid dose. Two patients participated in two cohorts in SPR001-201. Clinical trial SPR001-202 was a 12-week clinical trial of 11 patients treated with a fixed dose of 400mg tildacerfont once daily. Nine of the 11 SPR001-202 patients also participated in SPR001-201. A total of 26 unique classic CAH patients have been treated to date with tildacerfont. The results from the clinical trials to date suggest that tildacerfont may reduce elevated androgens and may also allow for reduction of supraphysiologic glucocorticoid doses.
 Previous observations had identified that tildacerfont interacts with CYP3A4, a liver enzyme that is responsible for the metabolism of a number of drugs. When a drug inhibits or induces CYP3A4, it can impact the body’s ability to metabolize other drugs. In SPR001-201, we observed that tildacerfont led to an approximately two-fold increase in the levels of dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid that is primarily metabolized through CYP3A4. In order to eliminate any potentially confounding drug-drug interactions from our clinical trial, we subsequently removed patients who were being treated with dexamethasone from our efficacy analyses. No drug-drug interactions were observed with other glucocorticoids and we made no other modifications.

SPR001-201 Results
 SPR001-201 was our first clinical trial in adults with classic CAH and was a proof-of-concept, dose-escalating Phase 2a clinical trial in patients who were on a stable glucocorticoid dosing regimen but still had levels of 17-OHP that were four-fold or greater above the 200 ng/dL upper limit of normal (ULN). Patients enrolled in three sequential cohorts, and during the clinical trial, could not change their underlying glucocorticoid regimen to avoid confounding the effect of varying glucocorticoid levels on disease-driving hormones. The clinical trial assessed the safety and pharmacokinetics of tildacerfont across a range of doses from 200mg to 1,000mg once daily and 100mg and 200mg twice daily. Pharmacodynamic activity was assessed using ACTH, 17-OHP, and A4 overnight with the baseline and key assessment at 8:00 a.m. This overnight period was selected as it represents the time period during which excess production of ACTH and hormones and androgens peak. The goal of this clinical trial was to assess whether tildacerfont could blunt the magnitude of this rise in the hormones.
 The enrollment screening criteria for SPR001-201 ensured that 17-OHP was elevated in all but one patient at baseline (8:00 a.m. on day one) enrolled in this clinical trial; however, the levels of ACTH and A4 were more variable. In a post-hoc analysis, we identified two homogenous patient groups using ACTH and A4 and classified these patients as either those with highly elevated adrenal hormones at baseline or on supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids with normal or near normal levels of A4 at baseline. In our clinical trial, patients with highly elevated levels of adrenal hormones at baseline had highly elevated ACTH, 17-OHP, and A4 levels, generally greater than twice the ULN and, more commonly, greater than four times the ULN. Patients with highly elevated levels of adrenal hormones at baseline were on a stable mean daily supraphysiologic dose of approximately 25mg of hydrocortisone, or a dose of another glucocorticoid equivalent to 25mg of hydrocortisone. Patients on supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids with normal or near normal levels of A4 at baseline had elevated 17-OHP levels but had ACTH and A4 generally less than twice the ULN and more commonly, within the normal bounds for ACTH and A4. These patients were on doses equivalent to a mean daily supraphysiologic dose 36mg of hydrocortisone, which was a 44% higher total daily dose than patients with highly elevated levels of adrenal hormones at baseline. These findings suggest that patients with highly elevated levels of adrenal hormones at baseline may have been receiving inadequate glucocorticoid doses to provide adequate control of their disease, possibly due to an inability to tolerate higher doses of glucocorticoids or unwillingness to accept the adverse outcomes attributed to chronic dosing of supraphysiologic glucocorticoids. Given the clear differences in baseline hormone profiles and glucocorticoid dosing, we decided to analyze the effect of tildacerfont on hormones in these two groups independently. We believe that by identifying these two homogeneous patient groups, and designing our development program around the two groups, we are uniquely positioned to address the two major areas of unmet medical need for these patients.
 Table 1 summarizes the key demographic and baseline characteristics across the two patient groups. The demographics across both patient groups were similar. The age distribution trended to older subjects with an average age of 44 years, as compared to an age range of 19 years to 67 years, with an average body mass index (BMI) of

approximately 31, signifying an obese population on average. The daily glucocorticoid dose and baseline hormones were different between the two patient groups.

 Table 1. Demographics and baseline hormones in non-dexamethasone patients (SPR001-201).
 While the exposure levels, as a function of dose, generally demonstrated dose linearity, no clear dose-response was observed in ACTH, 17-OHP, and A4 reductions. The lowest evaluated dose of 200mg once daily resulted in hormone changes that were comparable to those observed at higher doses (Figures 7-9). Also, overall dosing twice daily did not result in greater hormone reductions compared to once daily dosing. This finding corresponds with the initial predicted receptor occupancy data based on preclinical experiments demonstrating at least 90% receptor occupancy at doses of tildacerfont up to 400mg.
 Figures 7-9 below summarize the changes in hormones across the overnight period. We conducted a post-hoc analysis which divided the subjects in this study into two groups, based on patients with highly elevated levels of adrenal hormones at baseline and patients on supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids with normal or near normal levels of A4 at baseline. Of the patients with highly elevated levels of adrenal hormones at baseline, there were 11 patients at doses equal to 200mg, six of whom received 200mg once per day in Cohort A and five of whom received 100mg twice per day in Cohort C, and 12 patients at doses greater than 200mg, six of whom received 600mg once per day and the same six of whom received 1,000mg once per day. There were six patients on supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids with normal or near normal levels of A4 at baseline, one patient at 200mg once per day in Cohort A and five patients at doses greater than 200mg, each receiving 200mg twice per day in Cohort B.
 Patients with highly elevated levels of adrenal hormones at baseline had baseline levels of ACTH, 17-OHP, and A4 that were substantially above the target goal for these hormones (ACTH target of 63.3 pg/mL, 17-OHP target of 1200 ng/dL and A4 target of 152 ng/dL for males and 262 ng/dL for females). Subsequent to receiving tildacerfont for 14 days, the mean levels of all three hormones were generally reduced throughout the overnight period from 10:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. These reductions were observed despite no changes in glucocorticoid dosing. We believe that the reductions in patients with highly elevated levels of adrenal hormones at baseline demonstrated proof-of-concept and supported further studies to assess the ability of tildacerfont to reduce hormones.
 Patients on supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids with normal or near normal levels of A4 at baseline had mean baseline levels of ACTH and A4 that were already below the target goal for these hormones. Treatment with tildacerfont did not lead to clinically meaningful reduction of these levels, suggesting that administering tildacerfont in these patients have a low risk of excessive adrenal suppression. We believe the observed changes in these hormones are reflective of typical day-to-day variation in these patients. Treatment of these patients who had elevated levels of 17-OHP led to a modest decrease in 17-OHP.

Figure 9. Change from baseline in A4 (ng/dL) (SPR001-201).
 Of note, one classic CAH patient enrolled in this clinical trial, who had a pre-existing testicular mass classified as TART, saw a 25% decrease in the size of his tumor following six weeks of dosing with tildacerfont through two dose escalations in Cohort A. TARTs are directly driven by excess ACTH and the empiric standard of care to reduce TARTs is high dose dexamethasone. This tumor shrinkage is consistent with the mechanism of action of tildacerfont, reduction of excess ACTH, and provides the first known evidence of a non-steroidal, non-surgical reduction in a TART.
 Tildacerfont was well tolerated in SPR001-201 at doses up to 1,000mg once daily. No drug-related SAEs were reported. The most common adverse event was headache (n=3). The majority of events were grade one in nature. A female subject (age 48; 200mg twice daily) experienced a grade three hot flush that resolved on its own within 30 minutes in the first week of treatment. One event of special interest was observed at the highest dose of 1,000mg once daily. After 14 days of treatment at 1,000mg once daily, this patient experienced a grade one liver-related adverse event, as determined by the investigator. This patient had elevated levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) between five and nine times ULN, elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) less than five times ULN, and no increases in bilirubin. The event resolved on its own without additional medical intervention. No cases of liver enzyme elevations above three times the ULN were observed in any patient receiving total daily doses of 600mg, which is approximately three times the proposed therapeutic dose, and below.

 SPR001-202 Results
 SPR001-202, our open-label, 12-week Phase 2a clinical trial, assessed the ability of a daily dose of 400mg of tildacerfont to lower disease-driving hormones such as ACTH, 17-OHP, and A4 over a 12-week dosing period. SPR001-202 was an extension clinical trial of SPR001-201, where the enrollment criteria was either prior participation in SPR001-201 or treatment-naïve patients meeting the 17-OHP criterion in SPR001-201. Disease-driving hormones were assessed at approximately 8:00 a.m. on each day corresponding to the peak excess hormone production. This clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of long-term treatment with tildacerfont and to assess the magnitude of hormone reductions after 12 weeks of treatment.
 As with SPR001-201, dexamethasone subjects (n=3) were excluded from pharmacodynamic activity summaries but included in safety summaries. The table below summarizes the key demographic and baseline hormones in the non-dexamethasone patients.

 Table 2. Demographics and baseline hormones (SPR001-202).
 Like with the SPR001-201 clinical trial, in the SPR001-202 clinical trial, we conducted a post-hoc analysis which divided the subjects in this study into patients with highly elevated levels of adrenal hormones at baseline and patients on supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids with normal or near normal levels of adrenal hormones at baseline. We observed that tildacerfont-treated patients with highly elevated levels of adrenal hormones at baseline had mean maximum reductions in ACTH, 17-OHP, and A4 of approximately 80% compared to baseline at 8:00 a.m., bringing the levels of these key hormones to near normal levels that are used as targets for standard glucocorticoid therapy. In addition, 60% of patients achieved normalization of ACTH levels, one subject at week two prior to discontinuation from the clinical trial and two subjects during month three, and 40% achieved normalization of A4 levels during month three. We are not aware of normalization of these highly elevated hormones in classic CAH patients with any other investigational product candidate without increases to daily steroid doses.
 As reflected in the figures below, we observed reductions in these hormones as early as the two-week time point and the reductions increased throughout the 12-week dosing period of the clinical trial. Last observation carried forward is applied for patients missing assessments during the 12-week period in the time course figures.



Figure 11. Change from baseline in ACTH (pg/mL) (SPR001-202).
 
Figure 12. Change from baseline in 17-OHP (ng/dL) (SPR001-202).
 
Figure 13. Change from baseline in A4 (ng/dL) (SPR001-202).
 Upon completion of tildacerfont dosing at week 12, in patients with highly elevated levels of adrenal hormones at baseline, levels of these disease-driving hormones increased, approaching their pre-trial baseline levels at follow-up, week 16. The results from this clinical trial are consistent with the ability of tildacerfont to inhibit CRF signaling, leading to reduction of adrenal stimulation by ACTH and the production of androgen precursors. Treatment with tildacerfont in this clinical trial led to this adrenal hormone and androgen reduction without requiring any change in the dose of glucocorticoids.
 Of the patients with highly elevated levels of adrenal hormones at baseline, the best response for each patient in the non-dexamethasone group in month three is summarized below. The majority of patients achieved robust reductions. One patient discontinued prior to month three and is not included in this figure. This patient had reductions of 99%, 82% and 68% for ACTH, 17-OHP and A4, respectively, prior to discontinuation.




Figure 14. Change from baseline in hormones in patients with highly elevated levels of adrenal hormones at baseline in month three (SPR001-202) at the individual patient level for subjects completing 12 weeks of treatment.
 Patients on supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids with normal or near normal levels of A4 at baseline upon entry to SPR001-202 had mean levels of ACTH, 17-OHP and A4 that were well below the target goal. Administration of tildacerfont to these patients did not lead to significant changes in these levels. We believe that this finding is important because it supports that there may be a limit as to how much tildacerfont can suppress adrenal function, which could reduce the risk that excess dosing with tildacerfont could lead to excessive levels of suppression. This is consistent with the results we observed in SPR001-201.
 Tildacerfont was well tolerated in SPR001-202. The most common adverse events were upper respiratory tract infection (n=2) and elevated A1c (n=2) and all four events deemed not related to tildacerfont treatment. The majority of events were grade one in nature. One subject discontinued study drug due to itching without a rash experienced between weeks two and four of treatment.
 Patients with highly elevated levels of adrenal hormones at baseline were receiving supraphysiologic glucocorticoid doses equivalent to approximately 25mg hydrocortisone daily. Based on the levels of ACTH, 17-OHP, and A4 at baseline, these glucocorticoid doses were insufficient to adequately suppress androgen synthesis. However, the addition of tildacerfont lowered the levels of these hormones by approximately 80%, bringing them close to normal levels. In contrast, patients on supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids with normal or near normal levels of A4 at baseline upon enrollment in the clinical trial were receiving supraphysiologic glucocorticoid doses equivalent to 36mg of hydrocortisone daily. Because the baseline levels of ACTH and A4 were all well below the target goal, we believe that these patients may have been receiving glucocorticoid doses that were higher than would be necessary with the addition of tildacerfont. Furthermore, we believe that treatment of these patients with tildacerfont could enable these patients to reduce their glucocorticoid doses. Over time, we believe that tildacerfont may enable both groups of patients to achieve potentially normal or markedly improved levels of androgen synthesis with minimized levels of glucocorticoid replacement.
 Late-Stage Clinical Trials in Adult Classic CAH
 We have two ongoing late-stage clinical trials in patients with classic CAH. CAHmelia-203, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging Phase 2b clinical trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of tildacerfont in adults with classic CAH who are exhibiting highly elevated levels of A4 at baseline while on stable glucocorticoid dosing. This clinical trial will enroll approximately 72 patients who have elevated levels of A4. For the first six weeks, patients will receive blinded placebo to assess their adherence to their existing glucocorticoid therapy. Patients who continue to meet all eligibility criteria at the end of this period will enter a three-part treatment period. During the placebo-controlled treatment period, patients will be randomized in a blinded manner to receive placebo, 50mg, 100mg, or 200mg tildacerfont once daily. Dosing in the placebo-controlled treatment period will continue for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint of the clinical trial will be the percentage change in A4 from baseline at week zero to week 12 with secondary endpoints including the proportion of patients with levels of 17-OHP and A4 within the target and normal range, respectively, and change in lesion volume of TARTs in men. Following the placebo-controlled treatment period, all patients will receive tildacerfont following a proposed dose-escalation protocol based on hormone response in which the dosage will be increased to 200mg once daily over 12 weeks.

Following the 12-week dose-escalation period, all patients will continue receiving tildacerfont at 200mg once daily for an additional 46 weeks. Patients who achieve control of A4 while on supraphysiologic glucocorticoid treatment will have the opportunity to taper down their glucocorticoid dosing in the open-label period according to a pre-specified algorithm in the protocol. Additional endpoints include clinical outcomes and patient and clinician reported outcomes.
 
Figure 15. Design of trial CAHmelia-203
 We also initiated CAHmelia-204, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tildacerfont in reducing supraphysiologic glucocorticoid usage in approximately 90 adults with classic CAH in patients on supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids with normal or near normal levels of A4 at baseline. This clinical trial is designed in two parts. In the first part of the clinical trial, patients will be randomized to receive 200mg tildacerfont once daily or placebo for 24 weeks. During the second part of the clinical trial, all patients will receive open-label 200mg tildacerfont once daily for 52 weeks. Throughout the trial, tapering of glucocorticoids will be guided according to a pre-specified algorithm and continue to the lowest level possible (replacement levels only), as long as patients remain well controlled based on standard biomarkers and clinical assessments.
 

Figure 16. Design of trial CAHmelia-204
 The primary endpoint of this clinical trial will be the proportion of patients with reduction of glucocorticoid dose greater than or equal to 5 mg/day of hydrocortisone equivalent (HCe) at week 24. The percent change in glucocorticoid dose from baseline to week 24 will be assessed as a secondary endpoint. Median total cumulative GC dose (HCe) at week 24, change from baseline in insulin resistance at week 24, and percent change from baseline in weight at week 24 and after 52 weeks of tildacerfont treatment will also be assessed as secondary endpoints. Effects

on insulin resistance, weight, waist circumference, bone mineral density after 52 weeks of tildacerfont treatment will be assessed as exploratory endpoints.
 Based on analyses of our clinical data to date, we have chosen to target two distinct groups of classic CAH patients with either supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids with normal or near normal levels of A4 at baseline or highly elevated levels of A4 at baseline. These two groups, which together make up the entire classic CAH patient population, have differing disease challenges centered on excessive adrenal androgen levels or excessive glucocorticoid usage, both of which have the potential to be addressed by treatment with tildacerfont, if approved. We believe our strategy to study CAH patients in these two enriched sub-populations may enable us to observe clinically meaningful outcomes. Additionally, we believe these two clinical trials will provide sufficient patient exposures for our registrational safety database. Assuming positive results from these clinical trials, we plan to meet with the FDA and certain comparable foreign regulatory authorities to discuss potential registration.
 Phase 2 CAHptain Clinical Trial in Pediatric Classic CAH
 At birth, newborns with classic CAH are immediately faced with a risk of adrenal crisis, which produces symptoms that include vomiting, severe dehydration, low blood pressure, and life-threatening shock. Replacement glucocorticoid therapy, initiated immediately after diagnosis, remains the customary treatment for children with classic CAH. Glucocorticoid therapy is administered to avoid precocious puberty. The growth suppressing effects of glucocorticoids, however, combined with the early bone growth closure from elevated levels of adrenal androgens, limits the height potential of children impacted by classic CAH. Many patients with classic CAH complete growth prematurely and are ultimately short as adults. We believe tildacerfont has the potential to reduce both the levels of adrenal androgens and the need for excess glucocorticoids, which may enable management of classic CAH at doses of glucocorticoids near physiologic replacement levels, with potential to enable more normal growth progression through childhood and adolescence. We estimate that children represent approximately 20% of the total classic CAH patient population.
We have initiated CAHptain, a Phase 2 open-label clinical trial, which will utilize a sequential three cohort design, to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of tildacerfont in children two to 17 years of age. The study will also characterize changes in androgen levels over 12 weeks of treatment, and the ability to reduce daily glucocorticoid dose based on A4 normalization. An optional open-label extension period will provide additional open-label treatment with tildacerfont to provide long-term safety data for up to two years. Cohort 1 will enroll up to five participants between the ages of 11 and 17 years of age, who will receive a weight-adjusted, adult dose equivalent of 50mg QD of tildacerfont. Cohort 2 will enroll up to five participants between the ages of 11 and 17 years of age, who will receive a weight-adjusted, adult dose equivalent of 200mg QD of tildacerfont. Cohort 3 will enroll up to 10 participants between the ages of two and 10 years of age, who will receive a weight-adjusted, adult dose equivalent of 200mg QD of tildacerfont.
 
Figure 17. Design of CAHptain
 The primary endpoint of this clinical trial will be safety. Additional secondary endpoints include the proportion of subjects who achieve reduction in A4 or daily glucocorticoid dosing at week 12 and the proportion of

subjects with elevated A4 at baseline who achieve a reduction in A4 at week 4. We anticipate topline data from adolescents (cohorts 1 and 2) of the Phase 2 open-label clinical trial in the second half of 2023.
Phase 2 P.O.W.E.R. Clinical Trial in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)
 PCOS is a hormonal disorder common among females of reproductive age affecting nearly five million females in the United States and approximately 115 million females worldwide. PCOS is characterized by elevated levels of androgens, cysts in the ovaries, and irregular periods. Females with PCOS present with additional symptoms, including hirsutism, alopecia, acne, infertility, weight gain, fatigue, depression and mood changes. The underlying causes of PCOS are unknown. However, excess insulin secretion and low-grade inflammation, which stimulate the polycystic ovaries, have been linked to androgen excess. The source of this androgen excess may be ovarian, adrenal, both adrenal and ovarian, or from other sources. Adrenal androgen excess in PCOS appears to occur independently of ovarian androgen excess, suggesting it may represent an intrinsic, and possible primary source of abnormal synthesis of androgens. Adrenal androgen excess in PCOS does not result from enzymatic deficiencies, rather it represents an altered adrenal responsivity to ACTH. We believe that, in women whose PCOS is caused by elevated adrenal androgens, tildacerfont may provide a therapeutic option to treat the underlying cause of disease through reductions of ACTH. We may pursue orphan drug designation in this patient population.
By leveraging our existing Phase 1 program, which includes safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of tildacerfont, we have initiated P.O.W.E.R., a Phase 2 proof-of-concept, randomized, placebo-controlled dose escalation study which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of tildacerfont titrated to 200 mg QD compared to placebo at 12 weeks of treatment in subjects with PCOS and elevated adrenal androgens as measured by DHEAS levels at baseline.

Figure 18. Design of P.O.W.E.R.
 The primary endpoint of this clinical trial is the absolute change from baseline in DHEAS. Additional secondary endpoints include safety and tolerability, the proportion of subjects who achieve a 30% or greater reduction in DHEAS and change from baseline in hormonal biomarkers. We anticipate topline results from the Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial in the first half of 2023.
 Potential Role of Tildacerfont in the Treatment of Non-Classic CAH
 The non-classic form of CAH (non-classic CAH), also called late-onset CAH, occurs in approximately one in 1,000 of the general population. In females, non-classic CAH is characterized by a generally less severe dysregulation of cortisol production and clinically manifests with a variety of late-onset virilizing symptoms. Females may experience irregular periods, hirsutism, deep voice, and infertility. Some males and females may experience early onset puberty and rapid growth in childhood but short stature in adulthood. Other symptoms of non-classic CAH include low bone density, severe acne, obesity, and elevated lipids. Patients with non-classic CAH typically do not require glucocorticoids to replace deficiencies in cortisol levels. However, they possess high levels of adrenal androgens caused by the inability of their endogenous levels of cortisol to properly regulate ACTH production and adrenal stimulation. Although, genetic mutations have been associated with about 30% to 40% of residual 21-hydroxylase enzymatic activity, approximately 5% of patients presenting with non-classic CAH may have a mutation in one copy of the 21-hydroxylase gene, that results in clinical phenotype that is indistinguishable from classic CAH. We believe that tildacerfont has the potential to bring non-steroidal therapeutic benefit to these non-classic CAH patients with the severe form of disease.


Sales and Marketing
 We currently do not have a commercial organization for the marketing, sales, and distribution of pharmaceutical products. We intend to build a highly specialized commercial organization to support the commercialization of tildacerfont, if approved, in the United States. Given a relatively small number of endocrinologists and specialists treat a large proportion of patients with classic CAH, we believe this market can be effectively addressed with a modest-sized targeted commercial sales force, alongside various high-touch patient initiatives. If tildacerfont is approved for additional indications, we plan to leverage our rare disease commercial infrastructure and expertise to efficiently address those patient populations. We plan to seek strategic collaborations to benefit from the resources of biopharmaceutical companies specialized in either relevant disease areas or geographies in markets outside the United States.

 The Lilly License Agreement shall remain in effect until the expiration of all payment obligations thereunder, unless terminated earlier as follows, (i) termination upon mutual agreement, (ii) unilateral termination by us, on a worldwide basis or with respect to any country or countries, in our sole discretion, upon 60 days’ advance written notice, (iii) unilateral termination by either party upon written notice of the other party’s material breach of its obligations under the Lilly License Agreement and failure to cure such breach within 90 days after receiving written notice of such breach, and (iv) unilateral termination by either party in the event of a general assignment for the benefit of creditors of the other party or if proceedings are commenced against such other party relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, winding up, or composition or adjustment of debt, and such proceedings continue undismissed, or an order with respect to the foregoing shall be entered and continue unabated, for a period of more than 60 days.


License Agreement with Kaken Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd (Kaken)
 On January 5, 2023, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement (the Kaken License Agreement) with Kaken. Under the terms of the Kaken License Agreement, we granted to Kaken the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize our product candidate, tildacerfont, for the treatment of CAH in Japan. Pursuant to the Kaken License Agreement, Kaken will be responsible for securing and maintaining regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize tildacerfont in Japan. We will retain all rights to tildacerfont in all other geographies.
 We have also granted to Kaken a right of first negotiation with respect to the development, manufacturing and commercialization of tildacerfont for CAH in China (including Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau), South Korea and other specified southeastern Asian countries, and for indications other than CAH.
 Pursuant to the Kaken License Agreement, Kaken is required to make an upfront payment to us of $15.0 million. In addition to the upfront payment, we are entitled to receive up to an aggregate of approximately $65.0 million (at exchange rates in effect on the date of the Kaken License Agreement) upon the achievement of specified milestones related to the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of tildacerfont in Japan, including the achievement of specified net sales thresholds, if approved. Kaken has agreed to pay us a non-creditable, non-refundable specified purchase price for each unit of Company-manufactured product supplied to Kaken for commercial sale. In addition, we will also be entitled to receive a royalty for each unit of non-Company manufactured product sold equal to a range of double-digit percentages up to the mid-twenties based on annual net sales of tildacerfont in Japan. Both the purchase price for each unit and the royalty rate are subject to reduction in certain circumstances as specified in the Kaken License Agreement. Kaken’s obligation to pay royalties will continue for ten years after the first commercial sale in Japan or, if later, until the expiration of regulatory exclusivity of tildacerfont or the expiration of the last valid claim of a Company-licensed patent covering tildacerfont in Japan (the Royalty Term).
 We have agreed to supply Kaken’s clinical drug supply requirements of tildacerfont pursuant to a clinical supply agreement that the parties will enter into within ninety days of the effective date of the Kaken License Agreement. During the Royalty Term, we have agreed to supply Kaken’s requirements of tildacerfont pursuant to the Kaken License Agreement and a commercial supply agreement to be entered into by the parties, though Kaken may procure alternate suppliers. Following the Royalty Term, Kaken at its option may continue to purchase Company-manufactured tildacerfont at a purchase price equal to our manufacturing cost plus a low double-digit administrative fee.
 Either party may terminate the Kaken License Agreement (i) in the event the other party shall have materially breached its obligations thereunder and such default shall have continued for a specified period after written notice thereof or (ii) upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party. In addition, we may terminate the Kaken License Agreement upon prior written notice if Kaken ceases all development or commercialization activities for a specified period of time, subject to certain exceptions, or (ii) challenges the validity, enforceability or scope of any of the patents licensed by us to Kaken under the Kaken License Agreement, subject to certain conditions. Kaken may terminate the Kaken License Agreement at any time for convenience upon prior written notice provided within a specified period of time to us.
 Intellectual Property
 We have developed and continue to expand our patent portfolio for tildacerfont. We have licensed from Lilly at least 23 patents in the United States and other countries throughout the world covering composition of matter of tildacerfont, which are expected to expire in 2027, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. We also have pending applications from the same family in Venezuela, and Pakistan covering tildacerfont, which, if issued, would also be expected to expire in 2027, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. Additionally, we have licensed patents in the United States and other countries from Lilly covering methods of making tildacerfont, which are expected to expire in 2029, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 We have filed our own patent applications in the United States and other countries throughout the world directed to various methods of use and formulations, and six of these applications have been issued in the United States. Five of the issued United States patents are expected to expire in 2038 and one of the issued United States patents is expected to expire in 2039, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. The remaining patent applications, if issued, would be expected to expire between 2038 and 2042, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. We have also filed applications in the United States and other countries, including Argentina and

Taiwan, directed to combination therapies as well as further uses of tildacerfont. Any patents that would issue from these applications would be expected to expire no later than 2041, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. We have also filed an international patent application and a United States patent application directed to various forms of tildacerfont. Any patents that would issue from this application would be expected to expire around 2042, absent any patent term adjustments or extension. Patents related to tildacerfont may be eligible for patent term extensions in certain jurisdictions, including up to five years in both the United States and the EU, upon approval of a commercial use of the corresponding product by a regulatory agency in the jurisdiction where the patent was granted.
 In addition to patent protection, we rely on trade secret protection and know-how to expand our proprietary position around our chemistry, technology, and other discoveries and inventions that we consider important to our business. Under the Lilly License Agreement, Lilly granted intellectual property rights to know-how that are important to our business. The Lilly License Agreement imposes various development, regulatory, and commercial diligence obligations, payment of milestones and/or royalties, and other obligations.
 In addition, we have been granted orphan drug designation for tildacerfont for the treatment of patients with CAH in the United States and the EU, providing the opportunity to receive seven years of market exclusivity in the United States, which can be extended to seven and a half years if clinical trials are conducted in accordance with an agreed-upon PIP and ten years of market exclusivity in the EU, which can be extended to 12 years in the EU if clinical trials are conducted in accordance with an agreed-upon PIP.
 If approved in the United States, as tildacerfont has not previously been approved in the United States for any indication, tildacerfont may be eligible for five years of new chemical entity exclusivity, which would run concurrently with its seven years of orphan drug exclusivity if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for its approved uses. Further, if approved in the EU, as tildacerfont has not previously been approved in the EU for any indication, tildacerfont may be eligible for eight years of data exclusivity, as well as two years of market exclusivity. In the EU, an additional one year of exclusivity may be obtained if tildacerfont is approved for a new indication that provides a significant clinical benefit.
 We also seek to protect our intellectual property in part by entering into confidentiality agreements with companies with whom we share proprietary and confidential information in the course of business discussions, and by having confidentiality terms in our agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, clinical investigators, and other contractors and also by requiring our employees, commercial contractors, and certain consultants and investigators, to enter into invention assignment agreements that grant us ownership of any discoveries or inventions made by them while in our employ.
 In addition to patent protection around tildacerfont, we have also licensed from Lilly patents in the United States and other countries throughout the world directed to composition of matter around other CRF1 antagonists.
 Manufacturing
 We rely on contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) to produce tildacerfont in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), regulations for use in our clinical trials. The manufacture of pharmaceuticals for human use is subject to extensive cGMP regulations, which impose various procedural and documentation requirements and govern all areas of record keeping, production processes and controls, personnel training, and quality control. Tildacerfont is manufactured using common chemical engineering and synthetic processes from readily available raw materials. We have entered into manufacturing, development, and clinical supply agreements with our CMOs that provide for the procurement of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and drug product in connection with our planned and future clinical trials. These agreements contain no minimum purchase commitments or other purchase obligations. To date, the CMOs have met our manufacturing requirements, and we expect them to be capable of providing sufficient quantities of API and our drug product to meet estimated full-scale commercial needs. We plan to enter into commercial manufacturing and supply agreements with our CMOs prior to commercialization of tildacerfont, if approved, in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Our relationships with CMOs are managed by internal personnel with extensive experience in pharmaceutical development and manufacturing.
 Our contract manufacturing agreements give us visibility into the expected future cost of producing tildacerfont at commercial scale. Based upon a range of prices of currently marketed therapies indicated for orphan diseases, we believe that our cost of goods for tildacerfont will be highly competitive.


Competition
 The commercialization of new drugs is competitive, and we may face worldwide competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and ultimately generic companies. Our competitors may develop or market therapies that are more effective, safer, or less costly than any that we are commercializing, or may obtain regulatory or reimbursement approval for their therapies more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours.
 We are aware of other companies actively developing treatments for patients with classic CAH. Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. is developing a CRF1 receptor antagonist and has initiated Phase 3 registrational trials in adult and pediatric classic CAH and plans to report topline results from both studies in 2023. Crinetics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. plans to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in 2023 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an oral ACTH antagonist in adults with classic CAH. BridgeBio Pharma, Inc. is evaluating an AAV5 gene therapy product candidate to treat classic CAH in a Phase 1/2 proof-of-concept clinical trial. In addition, while tildacerfont ultimately seeks to significantly reduce steroid use for patients with classic CAH, patients will continue to use their steroid regimen. As high doses of corticosteroids are the current standard of care for the treatment of classic CAH, in the United States alone, there are more than two dozen companies manufacturing steroid-based products.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 As a pharmaceutical company that operates in the United States, we are subject to extensive regulation. Government authorities in the United States (at the federal, state, and local level) and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing, and export and import of drug products such as those we are developing. Any drug candidates that we develop must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in the EU are addressed in a centralized way, but country-specific regulation remains essential in many respects.
U.S. Drug Development Process
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and implements regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 ▪completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), regulations, and other applicable regulations;
 ▪submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 ▪approval by an IRB at each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
 ▪performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s current good clinical practices (GCP), regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its proposed indication;
 ▪submission to the FDA of a new drug application (NDA) for a new drug;
 ▪a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review;


▪satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality, and purity;
 ▪potential FDA audit of the preclinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA;
 ▪satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; and
 ▪FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
 Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the drug candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, and formulation, as well as animal studies, to assess the potential safety and activity of the drug candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human trials. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB or ethics committee, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 ▪Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion, the side effects associated with increasing doses and if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
 ▪Phase 2. The drug is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases or conditions and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage, and dosing schedule.
 ▪Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall benefit/risk ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA.
 In some cases, FDA may require, or sponsors may voluntarily pursue, post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical trials, that are conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience

from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, such as with accelerated approval drugs, FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 trials. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
 In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the Pediatric Research Equity Act does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. However, if only one indication for a product has orphan designation, a pediatric assessment may still be required for any applications to market that same product for the non-orphan indication(s).
 The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes 12 months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after the application is submitted. The FDA does not always

meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions and typically follows the advisory committee’s recommendations.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. After the FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process, and manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or (an) additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies, or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling or may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug safety and effectiveness, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also determine that a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or, if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or inability to manufacture the product in sufficient quantities. The designation of such drug also entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different

indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If an orphan designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the EU has similar but not identical benefits in that jurisdiction.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Any drug products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, manufacturing, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet.
In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the long-term stability of the drug product. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP requirements. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 ▪restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 ▪fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
 ▪clinical holds on clinical trials;
 ▪refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
 ▪product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
 ▪consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
 ▪mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
 ▪the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases, and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with

doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures.
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity, and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA and other regulatory agencies have also required that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA-approved labelling.
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA), which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 Marketing Exclusivity
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder.
 The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from accepting ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs referencing the approved application for review. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 Orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.

 Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we are and, upon approval and commercialization, will be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government

and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. In the United States, such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, price reporting, and physician sunshine laws and regulations.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing, or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor.
 Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute and the criminal healthcare fraud statutes (discussed below) was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, together with subsequent amendments and regulations, collectively, the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (discussed below).
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-covered, uses.
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) also created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) annually report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) and its implementing regulations, impose requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents

of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity, and their covered subcontractors. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 In order to distribute products commercially, we must also comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers, and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, track, and report gifts, compensation and other remuneration made to physicians and other healthcare providers, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we or our collaborators obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such drug products.
 In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, government authorities, private managed care providers, private health insurers, and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Such payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We or our collaborators may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Nonetheless, our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Moreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the drug product. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 If we elect to participate in certain governmental programs, we may be required to participate in discount and rebate programs, which may result in prices for our future products that will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. For example, drug manufacturers participating under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program must pay rebates on prescription drugs to state Medicaid programs. Under the Veterans Health Care Act (VHCA), drug

companies are required to offer certain drugs at a reduced price to a number of federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Department of Defense, the Public Health Service and certain private Public Health Service designated entities in order to participate in other federal funding programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Recent legislative changes require that discounted prices be offered for certain U.S. Department of Defense purchases for its TRICARE program via a rebate system. Participation under the VHCA also requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations. If our products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply.
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In Europe, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. Other Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 The marketability of any product candidates for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Healthcare Reform
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products and services, implementing reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and applying new payment methodologies. For example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which affected existing government healthcare programs and resulted in the development of new programs.
 Among the Affordable Care Act’s provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical industry, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following:
 ▪an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs;
 ▪an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively, and a cap on the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP);
 ▪a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
 ▪extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
 ▪expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals, including individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;


▪expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; and
 ▪a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
 There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act) was enacted, which includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argue the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the "individual mandate" was repealed by Congress. Further, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in Affordable Care Act marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the "donut hole" under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is possible that the Affordable Care Act will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the Affordable Care Act and our business.
 Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect until 2031, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. In addition, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 There has also been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which pharmaceutical companies set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Presidential executive orders, Congressional inquiries and proposed federal legislation, as well as state efforts, designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. In addition, the IRA, among other things (i) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and (ii) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. Further, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 We anticipate that these new laws and executive orders will result in additional downward pressure on coverage and the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. In addition, it is

possible that there will be further legislation or regulation that could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Data Privacy and Security
 We may also be subject to federal, state, local, and foreign data privacy and security laws, regulations, guidance, and industry standards. Such obligations may include U.S. state data breach notification laws, U.S. state health information privacy laws, federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and its implementing regulations, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR), and the United Kingdom’s “UK GDPR” (the EU GDPR and the UK GDPR together, GDPR).
 These laws impose increasingly stringent and evolving regulatory frameworks related to the processing of personal data that may increase our compliance obligations and exposure for any noncompliance. For example, where it applies, the GDPR requires stringent standards of data privacy and security concerning personal data, including limitations which could limit our ability to collect, use and share personal data (including health and medical information collected and processed in connection our relevant clinical trials and studies). In particular, the EU GDPR and UK GDPR significantly restrict the transfer of personal data to the United States and other countries whose privacy laws are considered ‘inadequate’ for the purposes of either or both of those regulations. If there is no lawful manner for us to effect cross-border transfers of personal data in compliance with the EU GDPR and/or UK GDPR, as applicable, or if the requirements for a compliant transfer are too onerous, we could face significant adverse consequences, including the interruption or degradation of our operations, the need to relocate certain parts of our operations, increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines and penalties, the inability to work with certain collaborators, partners, vendors and other third parties, and injunctions against our processing or transferring of personal data necessary to operate our business. In addition, sanctions for breaches of the EU GDPR and/or UK GDPR are significant: companies may face temporary or definitive bans on processing of personal data and other corrective actions; fines of up to 17.5 million pounds sterling under the UK GDPR / 20 million Euros under the EU GDPR, or, in each case, 4% of annual global revenue, whichever is greater; or private litigation related to processing of personal data brought by classes of data subjects or consumer protection organizations authorized at law to represent their interests.
 For more information on the potential impact of these laws, including the GDPR, see the section titled “Risk Factors—We are subject to stringent and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, regulations, rules, contractual obligations, policies and other obligations related to data privacy and security. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could lead to government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation, adverse publicity, and other adverse consequences, and could negatively affect our operating results and business.”
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Europe / Rest of World Government Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we or our potential collaborators obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a CTA must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an

independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed.
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under the EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application either under the so-called centralized or national authorization procedures.
 Centralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization, which is issued by the European Commission based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (the CHMP) of the EMA and that is valid in all EU Member States, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicines that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. Under the Centralized Procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when the authorization of a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Under the accelerated procedure the standard 210-day review period is reduced to 150 days.
 ▪National authorization procedures. There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several EU countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
 ▪Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorizations in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU Member State and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
 ▪Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
 In the EEA, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity and qualify for data exclusivity.
 The European Commission, on the basis of the opinion of the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products of the EMA, grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that may offer therapeutic benefits for life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the EU. In addition, orphan drug designation can be granted if the drug is intended for a life threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and without incentives it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would be sufficient to justify developing the drug. Orphan drug designation is only available if there is no other satisfactory method approved in the EU of diagnosing, preventing or treating the condition, or if such a method exists, the proposed orphan drug will be of significant benefit to patients. Orphan drug designation provides opportunities for free protocol assistance, fee reductions for access to the centralized regulatory procedures and ten years of market exclusivity following drug approval, which can be extended to 12 years if trials are conducted in accordance with an agreed-upon PIP. The exclusivity period may be reduced to six years if the designation criteria

are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
 For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
