ITEM 1. BUSINESS
BACKGROUND
GrowGeneration Corp. (together with all of its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, collectively “GrowGeneration” or the “Company”), incorporated in Colorado in 2014, is the largest chain of specialty retail hydroponic and organic garden centers in the U.S. and is a leading marketer and distributor of nutrients, growing media, lighting, benching and racking, environmental control systems and other products for both indoor and outdoor hydroponic and organic gardening. Currently, GrowGeneration has 60 retail locations across 16 states in the U.S. We also operate an online superstore for cultivators at growgeneration.com, as well as a wholesale business for resellers, HRG Distribution and MMI. 
Our business is driven by a wide selection of products, facility design services, solutions driven staff and pick, pack and ship distribution and fulfillment capabilities. GrowGeneration carries and sells thousands of products, including nutrients, growing media, lighting, environmental control systems, vertical benching and accessories for hydroponic gardening, as well as other indoor and outdoor growing products, that are capable of growing and maximizing yield and quality of a wide range of plants. Our products include proprietary brands such as Charcoir, Drip Hydro, Power Si, MMI benching and racking, Ion lights, Durabreeze fans, and more. GrowGeneration also provides facility design services to commercial growers. We currently employ approximately 455 employees, a majority of them we have branded as “Grow Pros”. Currently, our operations span over 946,000 square feet of retail and warehouse space.
MARKETS 
Hydroponics is a specialized method of growing plants using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent, as opposed to soil. This method is typically used for indoor cultivation to allow growers to better regulate and control growing 
conditions, including nutrient delivery, light, air, water, humidity, pests, and temperature. Hydroponic growers benefit from these techniques by producing crops faster and with higher crop yields as compared to traditional soil-based growers. Indoor growing techniques and hydroponic products are being utilized in new and emerging industries or segments, including the growing of cannabis and hemp. Vertical farms producing organic fruits and vegetables also utilize hydroponics due to a rising shortage of farmland as well as environmental vulnerabilities, including severe weather conditions and pests.
Our target customer segments include the commercial growers in the plant-based medicine market, the craft grower and vertical and urban farmers who grow organic herbs, fruits and vegetables. Additionally, we sell products from our distribution and other segment to wholesalers, resellers, and retailers. Unlike the traditional agricultural industry, these cultivators use innovative indoor and outdoor growing techniques to produce specialty crops in highly controlled environments. This enables them to produce crops at higher yields and quality, regardless of the season or weather conditions.
Controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) is a technology-based approach to maintain optimal growing conditions throughout the development of a crop. Production takes place within an enclosed growing structure such as a greenhouse or building. Plants are often grown using hydroponic methods in order to supply the proper amounts of water and nutrients to the root zone. CEA optimizes the use of resources such as water, energy, space, capital and labor. Different techniques are available for growing in CEA, including vertical farming, which can produce crops all year round in a controlled environment with increased yield and quality by adjusting the amount of light and nutrients the plants receive.
The landscape for hydroponic retail stores is very fragmented, with numerous single stores that we consider “targets” for our acquisition strategy. Further, the products we sell and the expert knowledge we provide are in demand due to the ever-increasing legalization of plant-based medicines, primarily cannabis and hemp, and the increasing number of licensed cultivation facilities.
SEGMENTS
We operate our business through the following business segments:
Retail: The core of our business strategy is to operate the largest chain of retail garden centers in the U.S. The hydroponic retail landscape is fragmented, which allows us to acquire “best of breed” hydroponic retail operations and leverage efficiencies of a centralized organization. During 2022, the Company acquired or opened 5 new locations and expanded its physical retail presence into 4 new states. Our plan is to continue to acquire, open and operate garden centers and related businesses throughout the U.S. However, in light of persistent difficult market conditions, the Company also closed 8 underperforming retail locations in 2022 and may consider additional store consolidation in 2023. Some of our garden centers have multi-functions, with added capabilities that include warehousing, distribution and fulfillment for our online platforms and direct fulfillment to our commercial customers.
Our retail segment also includes our commercial sales organization, which is focused on selling products and services, including end-to-end solutions, for large commercial cultivators outside of the physical retail network. When commercial customers gain new cultivation licenses, they need lighting, benching, environmental control systems, irrigation, fertigation and other products to outfit their facilities. Existing facilities also need consumable products for operations, as well as equipment updates from time to time. Commercial customers typically purchase large dollar amounts and sizes of products. We offer commercial customers volume pricing, terms and financing. 
E-commerce: Our digital strategy is primarily focused on capturing the home, craft and commercial grower online. GrowGeneration.com offers thousands of hydroponic products, all curated by our product team. GrowGeneration.com offers customers the option to have their orders shipped directly to their locations, anywhere in North America. GrowGeneration also sells its products to consumers through online marketplaces such as Amazon and Walmart and to wholesalers through its distribution website, HRGdist.com.
Distribution and other: In December 2020, GrowGeneration purchased the business of Canopy Crop Management Corp., the developer of the popular PowerSi line of monosilicic acid products, a widely used nutrient additive for plants. In March 2021, the Company purchased Charcoir, a line of premium coco pots, cubes and medium. In December 2021, the Company purchased the assets of Mobile Media, Inc. ("MMI"), a mobile shelving and storage solutions developer and manufacturer. In February 2022, the Company purchased the assets of Horticultural Rep Group, Inc. ("HRG"), a specialty marketing and sales organization of horticultural products. The Company is in the process of combining the operations and management of these non-retail enterprises. The products these companies provide are integrated into our retail, e-commerce, and direct sales activities and we receive incremental revenue from the sale of these products.
PROPRIETARY BRANDS
As part of its one-stop solution, GrowGeneration provides its customers with a wide selection of top quality products across all categories. A key part of that selection of products is GrowGeneration's own portfolio of industry-leading proprietary brands, including Ion Lighting, PowerSi monosilicic acid, Charcoir coco pots, cubes and medium, Drip Hydro liquid and powder nutrients, MMI Agriculture benching and racking, and other products. We believe that building private label and proprietary brand offerings will not only drive positive experiences and outcomes for customers, but also will have a positive impact on our margins and profitability. As a company of growers ourselves, we understand the ever-changing needs and technologies within our industry and seek to acquire and develop a strong portfolio of proprietary products for our customers. 
SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT
GrowGeneration seeks to support its customers and their communities in various ways. Together with Harvest 360 Technologies, LLC (H360), GrowGeneration launched a new program to support education and training for social equity license applicants. Regulations in both New York and New Jersey seek to create a framework to regulate cannabis in these states in a manner that promotes social equity and economic development, placing an emphasis on promoting inclusion of diverse populations in the medicinal and recreational cannabis industries. 
As part of this program, GrowGeneration and H360 established the NEXTGEN Micro Cultivation competition for applicants seeking micro grow licenses in the New Jersey adult-use cannabis market. GrowGeneration has agreed to donate up to $500,000 for education and training scholarships for 25 cultivation teams to receive access to an online portal with valuable resources to assist in the preparation of an application and to be educated and informed about best practices in the New Jersey program. GrowGeneration also provides access to equipment packages, facility design services, financing, advanced training and other market resources. 
GrowGeneration also supports communities through charitable donations to various causes, both within and outside the hydroponics industry. 
HOW WE EVALUATE OUR OPERATIONS
Sales
The Company generates sales primarily from the sale of hydroponic garden products, including nutrients, growing media, lighting, environmental control systems, and accessories for hydroponic gardening, as well as other indoor and outdoor growing products. In addition to these product sales, the Company sells and installs commercial fixtures.
The Company allocates transaction price to each distinct performance obligation and recognizes revenue, net of estimated returns and sales tax, at the time when it transfers control of the product to customers or when services are completed. Revenues are measured based on the amount of consideration that the Company expects to receive as derived from a list price, reduced by estimates for variable consideration. The variable consideration is based on the estimate of expected sales returns. The majority of our returns come from retail sales. Estimating future returns requires judgment based on current and historical trends and actual returns may vary from our estimates.
In evaluating the timing of the transfer of control of products to customers, the Company considers several control indicators, including significant risks and rewards of products, the Company’s right to payment and the legal title of the products. Based on the assessment of control indicators, product sales are typically recognized when they are made available to the carrier or are picked up by the customer. Promises related to product installation are considered a separate performance obligation from the product sale given the products can be used without customization or modification, installation is not complex and can be performed by other vendors. Installation revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation service to the customer. Sales and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue producing activities are excluded from revenue. Payment for goods and services sold by the Company is typically due upon satisfaction of the performance obligations. 
The Company's sales vary by the type of products that are sold between consumables and non-consumables. Due to their nature, purchases of consumables typically result in repeat orders as customers seek to replenish their supplies. Generally, in new markets where legalization of plant-based medicines is recent and licensors are starting new grow operations, there are more purchases of non-consumables for facility buildouts compared to purchases of recurring consumables. In more mature markets, there are generally more purchases of consumables than non-consumables. Our sales are also impacted by our customer mix of commercial and non-commercial customers, as commercial customers typically purchase more 
product and may receive volume discounts and other promotions. A majority of our sales are derived from commercial customers. In addition, the Company serves customers that are other wholesalers and resellers of both consumables and non-consumables.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales includes cost of goods and shipping costs. Cost of goods consists of cost of merchandise, inbound freight and other inventory-related costs, such as shrinkage costs and lower of cost or market adjustments. Occupancy expenses, which consist of payroll, rent and other lease required costs, including common area maintenance and utilities, are included as a component of store operations and other operational expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. 
Gross Profit
We calculate gross profit as sales less cost of sales. Cost of sales consists of cost of product sold, freight, tariffs, inventory shrink and obsolescence. Gross profit excludes depreciation and amortization, which are presented separately in our consolidated statements of operations.
Our overall gross profit margin varies with our product mix, in particular the percentage of sales of consumable products, which are products that are used regularly in daily growing operations, versus non-consumable products, which are products that are one-time purchases, such as in connection with commercial facility buildouts. Our customer mix also impacts gross profit margin due to larger commercial customers receiving discounts. In addition, costs incurred for logistics, obsolescence, inventory adjustments, and vendor purchase discounts impact reported gross margin.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses are comprised of store operations, primarily payroll, rent and utilities, and corporate overhead. Corporate overhead is comprised of share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, selling, general and administrative costs and corporate salaries and related expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) consist mainly of advertising and promotions, travel & entertainment, professional fees, and insurance. SG&A as a percentage of sales does not increase commensurate with an increase in sales. Our largest expenses are payroll and rent, which are largely fixed and not variable. Our advertising and marketing expenses are controllable and variable depending on the particular market.
Same-Store Sales
We assess the organic growth of our sales on a same-store basis. We believe that our assessment on a same-store basis represents an important indicator of comparative financial results and provides relevant information to assess our performance. New and acquired stores become eligible for inclusion in the comparable store base if the store has been under our ownership for the entire period in the same-store base periods for which we are including the store. Closed stores become ineligible for inclusion in the comparable store base in the month in which operations cease.
Research and Development
The Company has not incurred any research and development expenses during the period covered by this report. 
CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS
Our key customers vary by state and segment. No customer accounted for more than 5% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. Three customers represented 28% of total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022.
Our key suppliers include several manufacturers and distributors such as Hawthorne Garden Supply, Athena, Grodan, Hydrofarm, Canna Continental, and others. All the products purchased and sold are applicable to indoor and outdoor growing for organics, greens, and plant-based medicines. One supplier represented 24% and 28% of our total vendor purchases for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and 2 suppliers represented 41% of our total vendor purchases for the year ended December 31, 2020. Although the Company expects to maintain relationships with these vendors, the loss of either supplier would not be expected to have a material adverse impact on our business because of the competitive nature of the products that we sell. The Company also maintains direct manufacturing agreements with certain vendors.

SEASONALITY
Our business is subject to some seasonal influences. Historically, our highest volume of sales occurs in our second and third fiscal quarters, primarily based on the outdoor growing seasons, and the lower volume occurs during our first or fourth fiscal quarters. 
COMPETITION
The markets in which we sell our products are highly competitive. Our key competitors include many local and national vendors of gardening supplies, local product resellers of hydroponic and other specialty growing equipment, and online product resellers and large online marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay. Our industry is highly fragmented, with over 1,000 hydroponic retailers throughout the U.S. by management's estimates.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, we are the largest chain of hydroponic garden centers in the U.S. by management's estimates, and our pricing, inventory and product availability and overall customer service provide us the ability to compete in our industry. In addition, as we continue to increase the scope of our operations, including both retail and distribution, we expect to continue to purchase inventory at lower volume prices, which we expect will enable us to price competitively and deliver the products that our customers are seeking. The Company competes by delivering a one-stop shopping experience that includes the widest selection of hydroponics products, end-to-end solutions for all types of cultivation environments, in-store sales and product support, direct manufacturer pricing and industry-leading expertise and customer service.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Our intellectual property includes our brands and their related trademarks, domain names and websites, customer lists and affiliations, product knowledge and technology, patents, and marketing intangibles. We also hold rights to website addresses related to our business including websites that are actively used in our day-to-day business such as www.GrowGeneration.com. We own several the federally registered trademarks, including for “GrowGeneration®” and “Where the Pros Go to Grow®” as well as our proprietary brands.
MARKET DEVELOPMENT AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION
We sell products, including hydroponic gardening products, that end users may purchase for use in new and emerging industries or segments, including the growing of cannabis and hemp, that may not grow or achieve market acceptance in a manner that we can predict. Demand for these products depends on the uncertain growth of these industries or segments. 
In addition, we sell products that end users may purchase for use in industries or segments, including the growing of cannabis and hemp, that are subject to varying, inconsistent, and rapidly changing laws, regulations, administrative practices, enforcement approaches, judicial interpretations, and consumer perceptions.  For example, 37 U.S. states, as well as four U.S. territories and the District of Columbia, have adopted frameworks that authorize, regulate, and tax the cultivation, processing, sale, and use of cannabis for medicinal and/or non-medicinal use, while the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and the laws of other U.S. states prohibit some or all such activities. Notwithstanding this conflicted legal landscape, we believe that there is a continuing trend towards further legalization that will allow the Company to expand its marketplace opportunities. 
Our gardening products, including our hydroponic gardening products, are multi-purpose products designed and intended for growing a wide range of plants and are purchased by cultivators who may grow any variety of plants, including cannabis and hemp.  Although the demand for our products may be negatively impacted depending on how laws (including federal legalization of cannabis), regulations, administrative practices, enforcement approaches, judicial interpretations, and consumer perceptions develop, we cannot reasonably predict the nature of such developments or the effect, if any, that such developments could have on our business.
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
We strive to foster a collaborative and team-oriented culture and view our human capital resources as an ongoing priority. As of March 1, 2023, we employ 455 employees: 429 full-time employees, 26 part-time employees, and no temporary or seasonal workers. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements, and we have had no labor-related work stoppages. We believe we offer competitive terms and incentives to attract and retain employees, including employer contributions to health and welfare benefits, 401(k) plan matching, bonus programs, employee discounts and training opportunities. In late 2021, we also engaged a compensation consultant to ensure our key employee compensation packages are competitive.
