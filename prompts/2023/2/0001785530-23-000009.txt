Item 1. Business
Company Overview
We are an innovative biopharmaceutical company pioneering the development of therapeutics engineered to stimulate the body’s immune system for the treatment of cancer. We are leveraging our proprietary PREDATOR platform to design conditionally activated molecules that stimulate both adaptive and innate immunity with the goal of addressing the limitations of conventional proinflammatory immune therapies. Our INDUKINE molecules are intended to remain inactive in peripheral tissue yet activate selectively in the tumor microenvironment, or TME. Our most advanced clinical stage product candidates, WTX-124 and WTX-330, are systemically delivered, conditionally activated Interleukin-2 (IL-2), and Interleukin-12 (IL-12) INDUKINE molecules, respectively, for the treatment of solid tumors. We are currently conducting a Phase 1/1b clinical trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of WTX-124 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors as a single agent and in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, and a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of WTX-330 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors or lymphoma resistant to checkpoint inhibitors or for which checkpoint inhibitors are not approved.
We have also recently nominated WTX-712 as our next development candidate. WTX-712 is a systemically delivered, conditionally activated Interleukin-21 (IL-21) INDUKINE molecule that is being developed to minimize the severe toxicities that have been observed with recombinant IL-21 therapy and maximize clinical benefit when administered as monotherapy or in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in refractory and/or immunologically unresponsive tumors.
We are building our PREDATOR platform to generate a pipeline of innovative therapeutics that cover a diversity of immune stimulating mechanisms with the potential to address significant unmet medical need in cancer. We are also expanding our platform capabilities to other therapeutic areas including inflammatory diseases. Our PREDATOR platform consists of our protein engineering technologies and our know-how, which we use to generate INDUKINE molecules with multiple functional domains rationally engineered into a single protein to achieve the desired pharmaceutical profile. Each of our lead INDUKINE molecules consists of four components: a cytokine, an inactivation domain, a half-life extension domain and a proprietary protease-cleavable linker. Our INDUKINE molecules contain cytokines that mediate pro-inflammatory, anti-cancer mechanisms within the TME, with full potency and functionality observed in preclinical studies. The inactivation domain physically blocks the cytokine portion of the INDUKINE molecule in non-tumor tissue throughout the body, or the periphery, preventing it from binding to its receptor until it is cleaved and thereby activated in the TME. The half-life extension domain enables high systemic and tumor tissue exposure for the INDUKINE molecule prior to its cleavage in the tumor. After cleavage in the tumor, the half-life extension domain is removed, and the cytokine is released to activate immune cells. We select the proprietary protease-cleavable linker to enable conditional release of the cytokine portion of the INDUKINE molecule within tumor tissue. This selection is based on our extensive screening in preclinical studies to identify protease-cleavable linkers that are efficiently cleaved by a broad array of human tumor tissues with minimal cleavage in non-tumor tissues.
Our Pipeline
We are leveraging our novel PREDATOR platform to engineer conditionally activated proinflammatory immunomodulators, or INDUKINE molecules, which are delivered systemically but activated only in the TME, with the goal of generating potent anti-tumor response while minimizing toxicities. We have worldwide rights to our PREDATOR platform and our portfolio of INDUKINE product candidates, all of which we have developed internally. We believe our approach has the potential to overcome current limitations of systemic proinflammatory immunomodulatory therapies, such as cytokines, for the treatment of cancer. Our current pipeline is summarized below:
Using our PREDATOR platform, we have identified and are continuing to develop four initial product candidates: WTX-124, WTX-330, JZP898 (formerly WTX-613) and WTX-712. In addition to these product candidates, we are pursuing additional immune-oncology discovery programs in which we are applying our novel engineering approach to other targets. We are also expanding our technology to other disease areas, such as inflammatory diseases.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to utilize our proprietary PREDATOR platform to redefine the cancer treatment landscape with therapies to transform the lives of cancer patients. Key elements of our strategy include:
•Advancing our lead product candidate, WTX-124, through clinical development in selected solid tumor indications.
•Advancing WTX-330 through clinical development in selected solid tumors and lymphoma. 
•Continuing our collaboration with Jazz Pharmaceuticals Ireland Limited, or Jazz, as Jazz develops and commercializes JZP898 (formerly WTX-613), a differentiated, conditionally activated interferon alpha (IFNα) INDUKINE™ molecule.
•Advancing WTX-712 through preclinical development.
•Establishing a leading position in protein engineering and developing optimized conditionally activated molecules.
•Selectively entering into strategic partnerships while retaining key rights to our programs and platform in major pharmaceutical markets.
Traditional Cancer Therapy, Immunotherapy and the Need for New Treatment Options
The treatment of certain cancers has improved markedly over the past decade. Whereas many cancer treatments were historically limited to surgical removal, chemotherapy and radiation, recent advances target specific genetic changes in individual tumors or redirect the patient’s immune system to eliminate tumors and improve patient outcomes.
The latter approach, referred to as immunotherapy, represents one of the fastest growing segments in cancer treatment. The goal of immunotherapy is to harness an individual’s immune system to better enable it to identify, attack and kill tumor cells and to form long-term immunologic memory against tumors. The immune system is generally divided into the innate and adaptive arms, which are responsible for driving immediate and lasting anti-tumor responses, respectively. The innate immune system involves a diverse set of cells, including natural killer, or NK, cells, mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, neutrophils, macrophages and dendritic cells, or DCs, all of which generate a rapid local response to a foreign body, pathogen or tumor cell and release signals to activate and recruit cells, specifically lymphocytes, from the adaptive immune system. The adaptive immune system is the line of defense that is specific to a pathogen or tumor antigen and is composed of T cells and B cells, which work in concert to kill cells directly, produce antibodies and form immunologic memory. The latter is critical for the body’s immune response upon re-exposure to the initial antigen or pathogen. Many of the recent advances in immuno-oncology, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, have focused on improving the function of T cells.
Over the past decade, the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors, in particular programmed cell death protein 1, or PD-1, and programmed death-ligand 1, or PD-L1, inhibitors, has revolutionized the treatment of many cancers. The efficacy of these T cell targeted immunomodulators, both as single agents or in combination with standard of care therapies, including chemotherapy, has resulted in many of these regimens moving up the treatment paradigm to become first- or second-line treatment options in numerous cancer types, and the landscape for immunotherapy continues to rapidly evolve. However, features of the tumor cells or the TME play a role in the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, leaving many patients with advanced or metastatic disease either ineligible for or unresponsive to treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. The majority of patients who do respond to these therapies ultimately develop resistance and experience disease progression. As a result, many patients are still underserved and could benefit from novel approaches to immunotherapy that complement and/or enhance checkpoint inhibition, whether as monotherapy or in combination. We believe that the best way to improve outcomes for cancer patients is to stimulate additional or de novo immune cell responses within the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system to complement immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
Leveraging our PREDATOR platform and drug development capabilities, we are creating a portfolio of conditionally activated proinflammatory immunomodulators, including cytokines, designed to be optimized for the treatment of cancer. Cytokines are small biologically active proteins that play an essential role in immune cell function of both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. These proteins regulate immune responses by acting as chemical messengers for the body’s immune cells through receptor site binding. Interleukins, such as IL-2 and IL-12, IFNα and IL-21 are specific types of cytokines, produced primarily by cells of the immune system to signal and organize the immune response. In cancer, cytokines facilitate the ability of the immune system to recognize tumor cells as abnormal and harmful to the host. Cytokines further increase the proliferation of, enhance the survival of and direct a variety of immune cell types to infiltrate the TME and promote potent anti-tumor immune responses resulting in tumor cell killing and tumor clearance. Two cytokine therapies have received U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approval for cancer treatment: (1) aldesleukin for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, or RCC, and metastatic melanoma and (2) interferon-alfa2b for the treatment of several malignancies, including advanced melanoma.
However, despite promising anti-tumor activity, the clinical utility of approved cytokine therapies is limited due to toxicity and poor pharmaceutical properties, such as short half-life, reduced exposure of active drug in the tumor and the requirement for frequent administration. The efficacy observed is often accompanied by side effects that can be severe and can make treatment difficult for many patients to tolerate, which limits the ability of patients to remain on therapy long-term. The need to improve the pharmaceutical properties of cytokines to achieve increased therapeutic indexes provides an opportunity to address a large unmet need for safer, and potentially more efficacious, cytokine therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. Our PREDATOR platform allows us to engineer cytokines that can be delivered 
systemically and have activity selectively upon reaching the TME, thus potentially limiting systemic toxicity. We believe this unique profile will help overcome the limitations seen with other cytokine approaches.
Our Solution
Our PREDATOR Platform
We designed our PREDATOR platform to overcome the current limitations of systemic proinflammatory therapies. We use our PREDATOR platform to design molecules with superior tolerability and optimal pharmaceutical properties when administered systemically as inactive pro-drugs. They then undergo transformation to an active state upon reaching the TME, thereby delivering the full biological potency of antitumor immune modulation for maximum therapeutic potential.
Our PREDATOR platform is based on protein engineering to combine four critical components into a single INDUKINE molecule, as shown in the figure below.
•Cytokine Domain: An immunostimulatory molecule with no muteins or sequence alteration. Upon tumor specific conditional activation, the released cytokine works as a fully potent agonist, displaying the expected pro-inflammatory mechanism and pharmacology.
•Inactivation Domain: A domain that blocks the activity of the immunostimulatory molecule outside of the tumor, for which we have identified and optimized multiple formats with high affinity blockade to achieve minimal off-tumor toxicity and low peripheral target receptor-mediated clearance.
•Half-Life Extension Domain: A domain that imparts a longer half-life to the INDUKINE molecule thereby increasing systemic and tumor tissue exposure. Following cleavage within the tumor, half-life extension domain is removed and the immunostimulatory cytokine is released. We have selected multiple domain formats to enable our INDUKINE product candidates to maintain high systemic and tumor tissue exposure.
•Protease-Cleavable Linker: A novel, proprietary protease-cleavable linker substrate with optimal tumor selectivity that is used to impart conditional activation of the INDUKINE molecule through its cleavage, which releases the active cytokine. We have observed high stability of these proprietary protease-cleavable linker substrates in rodents and non-human primates, or NHPs, with minimal non-tumor tissue cleavage.
Linker Selection
A key challenge in the design of tumor-selective conditionally activated immunomodulators is the heterogeneity of tumor protease profiles. There is no single protease that is uniquely dysregulated in human tumors. Therefore, the identification of a linker substrate with the optimal profile cannot be achieved by biasing the linker sequence towards any single protease or protease family.
To ensure INDUKINE molecules are broadly activated across multiple tumor types, the linker substrate must be efficiently cleaved in the TME of many different tumors while remaining stable in circulation and in normal non-tumor tissues. We achieve this by utilizing a differentiated approach for linker identification and let the tumors select the substrate, rather than screening for linkers sensitive to cleavage by a single protease. Our process begins with a novel proprietary library of peptide sequences designed to target the universe of protease families known to be dysregulated in tumors. We initially screen these libraries for a high efficiency of cleavage and, based on the result, generate additional libraries to optimize the sequence motifs. We then screen the prioritized linker sequences that we have identified from the initial novel proprietary library of peptide sequences for cleavage by a panel of primary human tumor specimens and for stability when incubated with human serum or normal tissues. Leveraging this screening process, we initially screened several thousand linker sequences for optimal biochemical properties, and then screened the lead sequences for cleavage by a panel of primary human tumor specimens and normal non-tumor tissues. Linker sequences that were not efficiently cleaved by human tumor samples (for example, the linker shown as Linker 1 in the diagram below) were eliminated in the screening and those that were efficiently cleaved by human tumors but not cleaved by normal serum or tissues (for example, the linker shown as Linker 3 in the diagram below) were selected for incorporation into our INDUKINE 
molecules to confirm their activity in vitro and in vivo. We have selected linkers for our INDUKINE molecules with characteristics similar to those of Linker 3 in the table below.
Human Tissue Screening for Selection of Optimized Linker Candidates
We seek to protect aspects of our PREDATOR platform technology by obtaining patent protection in the United States and internationally. Currently, our patent portfolio for our PREDATOR platform technology includes two families of pending patent applications, which disclose and claim protease cleavable linkers and libraries of protease cleavable linkers, as well as polypeptides that contain such linkers, methods of making libraries and methods of screening libraries to identify linkers with desired properties. These patent families were recently filed, and no patents have granted. For more information see “Intellectual Property” described in this Part I, Item 1.
INDUKINE Molecules
We have rationally engineered INDUKINE molecules to have four key characteristics that we believe provide our product candidates with a unique profile and potential advantages in clinical settings when compared to other cytokines currently approved or in development:
•Optimized Anti-tumor Activity: The active portion of our INDUKINE molecules consists of a wild-type cytokine. We believe that delivery of a fully potent and functional cytokine molecule, as opposed to a mutein or cytokine with sequence alterations, into the TME will enable our product candidates to capture the full proinflammatory and immunomodulatory potential of cytokines and potentially result in optimal anti-tumor activity.
•Enhanced Tolerability: To improve tolerability, our INDUKINE molecules are designed to be administered as inactive pro-drugs that employ a tailored, high affinity blockade to minimize off-target toxicity. We aim to prevent peripheral pathway activation, as well as target-mediated disposition in normal tissues, with the goal of minimizing potential toxicity.
•Optimized Pharmaceutical Properties: We design INDUKINE molecules to be stable in the bloodstream and periphery and to have a long serum half-life to achieve efficacy without requiring the frequent dosing that is a limiting requirement of approved recombinant cytokines, such as aldesleukin, a recombinant human IL-2, or rhIL-2, therapy. Our design allows us to achieve high, biologically relevant tumor tissue exposure with our INDUKINE molecules. Once our molecules are cleaved within the tumor, the cytokine is released for either intratumoral target binding or rapid systemic clearance.
•Conditional Activation: Upon reaching the TME, INDUKINE molecules are activated via cleavage of our proprietary linkers by tumor-specific proteases which results in release of the cytokines in the tumor. We select our linkers to be specifically cleaved in the tumor and be stable in circulation and normal non-tumor tissues, with the goal enhancing the tolerability profile of our INDUKINE molecules.
Our Programs
WTX-124: Our IL-2 INDUKINE Molecule
Overview
Our lead product candidate, WTX-124, is a systemically delivered, conditionally activated IL-2 INDUKINE molecule that we are developing to minimize the severe toxicities observed with rhIL-2 therapy and maximize clinical benefit when administered as monotherapy or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced or metastatic tumors. We believe that these properties will also allow WTX-124 to have potential applicability in indications beyond those for which rhIL-2 therapy is currently approved. Key features of WTX-124 include preservation of full IL-2 potency and function as observed in preclinical studies, high affinity blockade of IL2—IL2R interaction in systemic circulation and non-tumor tissues, half-life extension for optimal tumor exposure and conditional protease activation within the TME due to our proprietary linker.
We designed WTX-124 to address the limitations of next generation IL-2 therapies in development by blocking the binding of IL-2 to the IL-2R in the periphery, thereby inhibiting IL-2 signaling and potentially minimizing toxicities, while maintaining binding to the high affinity IL-2Ra/ß/g in tumors to ensure the full pharmacology of IL-2.
WTX-124 consists of wild-type human IL-2, an IL-2Rß blockade element that eliminates binding to both high and medium affinity IL-2Rs expressed in normal tissues to neutralize IL-2 activity in the periphery, an antibody fragment that extends the circulation half-life and a proprietary linker for cleavage in the TME. As a prodrug, WTX-124 is conditionally activated in the TME to release an IL-2 cytokine to stimulate an anti-tumor immune response but with reduced peripheral toxicities. In preclinical studies, WTX-124 has exhibited favorable pharmacokinetic and tolerability profile with robust anti-tumor activity driven by the differentiation, activation and expansion of T effector and memory lymphocyte immune responses.
Market Opportunity
We are initially developing WTX-124 in tumor types known to be responsive to IL-2 and/or PD-1 targeting therapies including melanoma, RCC and non-small cell lung cancer. These are aggressive tumor types and many patients will eventually progress following treatment with standard of care. As a result, we believe there is a need for new therapies to improve response and durability. If successfully developed and approved, we believe WTX-124 represents a promising therapeutic option for patients with life-threatening diseases with high unmet medical need, either as monotherapy or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors or current or potential future standard of care agents. We have the opportunity to potentially expand upon the patient populations and indications beyond those for which Proleukin is approved. We intend to develop WTX-124 as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab, and eventually in combination with other standard of care therapeutics across different lines of therapy.
According to the Checkpoint Inhibitors Global Market Report 2023, the global checkpoint inhibitors market is expected to reach $46.27 billion in 2026 at a CAGR of 17.9%.
WTX-124 Preclinical Results
The preclinical data for WTX-124 has been presented in Cancer Immunology Research “Discovery of a Conditionally Activated IL-2 that Promotes Antitumor immunity and Induces Tumor Regression (Nirschl et al., Cancer Immunol Res (2022) 10(5):581-596). Preclinical data from the manuscript for WTX-124 demonstrated that:
•WTX-124, a pro-drug containing wild-type IL-2, is selectively processed and activated in tumors and is efficacious in murine models, even in the presence of regulatory T cells;
•WTX-124 activity is dependent on the processing of the pro-drug, as a non-cleavable version of WTX-124 (WTX-124-NC) is not efficacious in our models;
•Mechanistically, WTX-124 induces intratumoral activation of NK cells and CD8+ T cells and generates long-term memory in treated animals; and
•WTX-124 possesses good PK characteristics in mouse models and is stable in the periphery, with minimal release of free IL-2.
These data were used to support the investigational new drug, or IND, submission in the second quarter of 2022 and the clinical biomarker plan for the Phase 1/1b first-in-human study.
Clinical Development Plan for WTX-124
We submitted an IND for WTX-124 to the FDA in the second quarter of 2022 and subsequently received FDA clearance. We have designed our clinical development strategy for WTX-124 with the goal of achieving rapid proof-of-concept in historically immunotherapy-sensitive tumor types, including melanoma and RCC, indications for which aldesleukin is approved. We have initiated a Phase 1/1b clinical trial of WTX-124 for the treatment of relapsed or refractory advanced or metastatic solid tumors as monotherapy and combination therapy with pembrolizumab. This Phase 1/1b clinical trial is designed to assess safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy. We announced the initiation of patient dosing in September 2022. During the dose escalation phase of the trial, we expect to identify safe and pharmacodynamically active doses of WTX-124 for the respective dose escalation arms, following which we will open expansion arms for both monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab in advanced or metastatic renal cell cancer and advanced or metastatic cutaneous malignant melanoma. Other expansion arms may be added to enroll additional indications of interest. We anticipate reporting interim safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy data from these monotherapy cohorts in the fourth quarter of 2023.
The rationale for our clinical development strategy is as follows:
•IL-2 has been shown to have single agent activity in some cancers. Aldesleukin is approved for the treatment of metastatic RCC and metastatic melanoma. However, due to the toxicity associated with aldesleukin, which is noted in a black box warning, the drug is used infrequently. We believe, based on the mechanism of action of WTX-124, that it may be able to achieve higher intratumoral exposures of IL-2 than aldesleukin with minimal systemic toxicity, leading to monotherapy anti-tumor immune responses in patients with historically immunotherapy-sensitive tumor types who have progressed on, or subsequent to, immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Our preclinical data with WTX-124 show that WTX-124 has single agent anti-tumor activity in mouse tumor models and was well-tolerated. WTX-124 was also tolerated in NHPs at doses greater than predicted to be required for anti-tumor activity based on modeling the mouse tumor data. Single agent activity with competitor IL-2 compounds has been limited, potentially affording an opportunity for us to pursue an expedited clinical development and regulatory strategy for WTX-124 if we can show positive single arm efficacy data in a relapsed or refractory tumor type with high unmet medical need.
•IL-2 agonists and immune checkpoint inhibitors may act synergistically to enhance anti-tumor immune response. Clinical results have shown that aldesleukin induces responses as a single agent in patients who have progressed on immune checkpoint inhibitors. Our preclinical data with WTX-124 highlight the potential benefit of WTX-124 when combined with an anti-PD-1 antibody. These results suggest that combining novel IL-2 therapies with checkpoint inhibitors merits further evaluation as a regimen for treating cancer.
WTX-330: Our IL-12 INDUKINE Molecule
Overview
Our second product candidate, WTX-330, is a systemically delivered, conditionally activated IL-12 INDUKINE molecule that we are developing to minimize the severe toxicities observed with rhIL-12 therapy and maximize clinical benefit when administered as monotherapy or in combination with standard of care therapies including checkpoint inhibitors in relapsed or refractory advanced or metastatic solid tumors or lymphoma.
IL-12 is a potent, pleiotropic cytokine for immune-mediated killing of cancer cells, whose mechanism of action includes stimulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. IL-12 is a heterodimeric cytokine (p70) containing two subunits (p35 and p40). A subset of antigen-presenting cells, such as DCs, produce IL-12 upon activation, during the antigen presentation process. Binding of IL-12 to the IL-12R expressed on multiple immune cell populations activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway resulting in helper T cell differentiation, activation of cytotoxic NK and T cells, and inhibition or reprograming of immunosuppressive cells such as tumor-associated macrophages or myeloid-derived suppressor cells. IL-12 also increases the expression of antigen-presentation machinery, which is necessary to initiate an immune response in tumors that have not naturally stimulated an anti-tumor immune response, also referred to as “cold” tumors. IL-12 induces the production of interferon gamma, or IFNγ, a potent proinflammatory mediator of the downstream activities of IL-12 signaling. IFNγ, in turn, increases the production of IL-12 by mature DCs aiding in their antigen presentation capacity and driving activation of effector T cells. Numerous studies conducted by others have demonstrated that IL-12 treatment has significant anti-tumor activity in a range of preclinical models, with the induction of a long-lasting anti-tumor immune memory.
Due to the robust anti-tumor activity seen in preclinical studies, there has been significant interest in developing rhIL-12 therapy for advanced solid tumors. In early clinical trials conducted by a third party, the use of systemically administered rhIL-12 produced evidence of clinical activity in several tumor types, including RCC, melanoma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. However, the systemic administration of rhIL-12 was shown to be toxic, resulting in the death of two patients in one Phase 2 trial and multiple hospitalizations. Additional trials at tolerated doses yielded modest clinical activity, potentially due to a lack of sufficient and durable exposure of rhIL-12 in the TME at lower doses.
WTX-330 is designed to improve the pharmacological properties of IL-12 and require less frequent systemic administration. The prodrug is designed to remain inactive while circulating in the periphery and is activated preferentially in the TME to release an IL-12 cytokine. We believe activation of WTX-330 in the TME has the potential to stimulate a robust anti-tumor immune response while minimizing the peripheral toxicities that have been associated with systemic administration of rhIL-12 therapy. Key features of WTX-330 include high affinity blockade of IL-12 – IL-12R interaction in systemic circulation and non-tumor tissues, half-life extension for optimal tumor exposure and conditional protease activation due to our proprietary linker. In preclinical studies, we have observed high anti-tumor activity of an IL-12 INDUKINE surrogate molecule across a broad range of preclinical tumor models and that it has a favorable pharmacokinetic and tolerability profile.
WTX-330 Preclinical Results
The preclinical data for WTX-330 was presented at two annual meetings in 2022. In April 2022, we presented “WTX-330 is a Conditionally Activated IL-12 Prodrug that Fundamentally Reprograms Tumor Infiltrating CD8+ T cells and Drives Tumor Regression” at the American Association for Cancer Research, or AACR, 2022 Annual Meeting. In November 2022, we presented “mWTX-330, an IL-21 INDUKINETM Molecule, Selectively Activates Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes and Reprograms the Tumor Microenvironment in Murine Syngeneic Tumor Models” at the 37th Annual Meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer, or SITC. Based on the preclinical data summarized in these presentations for WTX-330, we concluded that:
•WTX-330 demonstrates anti-tumor activity in syngeneic mouse models and expands the therapeutic window compared to rIL-12;
•WTX-330 potently inhibits tumor growth in MC38, CT26, B16F10 and EMT6 mouse tumor models;
•Changes in immune profiles in mouse tumors after IL-12 INDUKINE therapy support a mechanism of action similar to rIL-12;
•Systemic administration of mWTX-330 results in increased tumor infiltration as well as significantly increased IL-12 and IFNγ signaling by intratumoral CD8+ T cells;
•mWTX-330 treatment metabolically reinvigorates effector cells in the TME, significantly increasing mitochondrial respiration by tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells as well as NK cells; and
•WTX-330, a fully human IL-12 INDUKINE™ molecule, has inducible activity and is preferentially activated in the presence of primary human dissociated tumor samples.
These data were used to support our IND submission in the third quarter of 2022 for WTX-330.
Clinical Development Plan for WTX-330
We submitted an IND for WTX-330 to the FDA in the third quarter of 2022 and subsequently received FDA clearance. We have initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of WTX-330 for the treatment of immunotherapy resistant advanced or metastatic solid tumors or lymphoma, to be followed by expansion arms in relapsed/refractory tumors following treatment with checkpoint inhibitors or tumors for which checkpoint inhibitors are not approved. We announced the initiation of patient dosing in February 2023. The trial is currently open for enrollment. In this Phase 1 trial, we plan to evaluate safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, biomarker changes and preliminary signs of anti-tumor activity. We believe the administration of WTX-330 to patients with relapsed or refractory advanced or metastatic solid tumors or lymphoma, in particular those who are resistant to checkpoint inhibitors or for whom checkpoint inhibitors are not indicated, could demonstrate clinical benefit as monotherapy, with the potential for us to pursue an expedited clinical development and regulatory strategy if we are able to show positive single arm efficacy data in a relapsed or refractory tumor type with high unmet medical need.
JZP898 (formerly WTX-613): IFNα INDUKINE Molecule Licensed Globally to Jazz Pharmaceuticals
Overview
JZP898 (formerly WTX-613) is a systemically delivered, conditionally activated IFNα INDUKINE molecule that we are collaborating with Jazz to develop to minimize the severe toxicities that have been observed with rhIFNα therapy and maximize clinical benefit when administered as monotherapy or in combination with checkpoint inhibitors or other standard of care therapy.
IFNα is a member of the type-I IFN family and a proinflammatory cytokine that exerts dual mechanisms of inhibiting tumor cell growth through both cytotoxic effects directly on tumor cells as well as driving anti-tumor immune responses. While IFNα can inhibit proliferation and induce direct cell apoptosis of some cancer cell types, this mechanism by itself is unlikely to be sufficient to fully control tumor growth. The additional ability of IFNα to activate and engage different cells of the immune system makes IFNα a potentially effective anti-tumor agent. IFNα activation of the immune response can occur directly by engagement of IFNARs on immune cells or indirectly by the induction of chemokines that attract immune cells to the tumor site. IFNα can activate NK cells, enhance their ability to kill and increase their production of IFNγ. Furthermore, it can increase macrophage activation and support differentiation and activation of DCs. Lastly, IFNα can have a direct effect on B lymphocytes as well as T lymphocytes where IFNα favors the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into helper T cells and directly activates CD8+ T cells, augmenting their IFNγ production and survival.
IFNα was one of the first cytokines clinically tested as a therapy for patients with cancer. Encouraging clinical benefit, although limited, resulted in regulatory approvals for the treatment of several hematological malignancies and solid tumors, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia, lymphoma and malignant melanoma. Widespread use of IFNα for hematologic and oncologic indications has unfortunately been hampered by adverse events linked to the on-target, off-tumor activity and its use in clinical practice has been supplanted by other therapies. In our preclinical studies, we observed the potential benefit of IFNα treatment in syngeneic mouse tumor models using colon, melanoma and breast tumor cell lines and the superior response obtained by the INDUKINE molecule format when compared to the dosing of recombinant cytokine.
Jazz Pharmaceuticals Global License
In April 2022, we entered into a licensing agreement with Jazz under which Jazz acquired exclusive global development and commercialization rights to JZP898 (formerly WTX-613), our differentiated, conditionally activated interferon alpha (IFNα) INDUKINE molecule, which has subsequently been designated JZP898 (formerly WTX-613), as well as products containing certain isolated recombinant polypeptides comprising IFNα that meet specified criteria. Pursuant to the terms of the licensing agreement, we are responsible for certain pre-clinical development activities with respect to JZP898 (formerly WTX-613) and other development activities specified in mutually agreed upon development plans. Jazz will generally reimburse us for the cost of such activities.
JZP898 (formerly WTX-613) is currently in preclinical development, and Jazz is responsible for global clinical development and commercialization. Jazz expects to submit an IND for JZP898 (formerly WTX-613) to the FDA in 2023.
WTX-712: Our IL-21 INDUKINE Molecule
WTX-712 is a systemically delivered, conditionally activated Interleukin-21 (IL-21) INDUKINE molecule. IL-21 is a pluripotent cytokine that activates anti-tumor T cell responses, induces B cell activation, and promotes generation and maintenance of germinal centers and tertiary lymphoid structures. A member of the common g-chain family of cytokines, IL-21 acts on a broader range of cells than IL-2 and does not induce vascular leak syndrome. Despite being a potent inducer of immune activation, IL-21 development has been hampered by poor PK properties and adverse events at dose levels associated with antitumor activity. WTX-712 is being developed to minimize the severe toxicities that have been observed with recombinant IL-21 therapy and maximize clinical benefit. 
Our Early Stage Programs
In addition to IL-2, IL-12, IFNα and IL-21, we are also applying our novel engineering approach to other targets and modalities. We believe that additional pro-inflammatory cytokines have the potential to empower the immune system in its fight against cancer and inflammatory diseases.
Our goal is to better understand how the localized tumor delivery of these cytokines using our INDUKINE molecules might contribute to disease control while reducing the toxicity that in many cases accompany the systemic delivery of these cytokines.
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with certain competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies; academic institutions; governmental agencies; and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing treatments and new treatments that may become available in the future.
We compete with other companies working to develop immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer including divisions of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies of various sizes. These companies are developing cytokines as immunotherapies using different modalities, including monoclonal antibodies, cell therapies, oncolytic viruses and vaccines.
Our lead product candidate, WTX-124, if approved, may face competition from other IL-2 based cancer therapies. Proleukin (aldesleukin) has been approved and is marketed for the treatment of both metastatic RCC and metastatic melanoma. In addition, we are aware of numerous clinical and preclinical IL-2 molecules using different platforms being developed for oncology indications, including programs from Alkermes Plc, BioNTech SE, Medicenna Therapeutics Corp., Synthekine Inc, Asher Biotherapeutics, Inc., F. Hoffman La-Roche AG, Genentech Inc. and Xilio Therapeutics, Inc.
There are no approved IL-12 therapies currently on the market for the treatment of cancer. However, if approved, WTX-330 may face competition from other IL-12 cytokine programs in clinical and pre-clinical development for oncology indications, including programs from Sanofi S.A. (Amunix), DragonFly Therapeutics, Inc., Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (Bristol-Myers Squibb Company), Oncorus, Inc., Turnstone Biologics Corp. (partnered with Takeda Pharmaceutical Corporation, or Takeda), Oncosec Medical Incorporated, Xilio Therapeutics, Inc. and Sonnet BioTherapeutics, Inc.
We are developing WTX-124 and WTX-330 as potential monotherapies in relapsed or refractory tumor types or in combination with checkpoint inhibitors or other standard of care therapies in advanced or metastatic malignancies with high unmet medical need. Standard of care therapies include chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and more recently, immunotherapies, including monoclonal antibodies and bispecific formats, antibody drug conjugates, adoptive cellular therapies, and cytokines. In addition, there are numerous investigational agents in clinical development. Combining agents to improve patient outcomes and prevent emergence of resistance has become the paradigm for treatment of cancer.
Many of our competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, preclinical testing, clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing than we do. Future collaborations and mergers and acquisitions may result in further resource concentration among a smaller number of competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors will also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our programs.
Our commercial potential could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market or make our development more complicated. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be efficacy, safety and convenience.
Manufacturing
To date, we have produced limited quantities of our product candidates at our own facilities for preclinical evaluation. We do not own manufacturing facilities capable of producing drug product for clinical trials or at clinical scale. We must manufacture drug product for clinical trial use in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, or similar foreign standards. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. We do not have and we do not currently plan to acquire or develop the facilities or capabilities to manufacture cGMP drug substance or filled drug product for use in human clinical trials. Going forward, we will rely on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture some of our preclinical product candidate supplies and will rely on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture all of our clinical trial product supplies. We will also contract with additional third parties for the filling, labeling, packaging, storage and distribution of our product candidates investigational drug products.
The manufacturing facilities for our product candidates must meet cGMP requirements and FDA certification before any product is approved and we can manufacture commercial products. Our third-party manufacturers will also be subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations.
Commercialization Plan
We intend to retain significant development and commercial rights to our product candidates and, if marketing approval is obtained, to commercialize our product candidates on our own, or potentially with a partner, in the United States and other major pharmaceutical markets. We currently have no sales, marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities and have no experience as a company commercializing products. We intend to build the necessary infrastructure and capabilities over time for the United States, and potentially other regions, following further advancement of our product candidates. Clinical data, the size of the addressable patient population, the size of the commercial infrastructure and manufacturing needs may all influence or alter our commercialization plans.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property is critical to our business and we strive to protect it, including by seeking to obtain and maintaining patent protection in the United States and internationally to cover our product candidates, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture and any other inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
Our patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications with composition of matter and method of use claims with respect to our product candidates, WTX-124, WTX-330, JZP898 (formerly WTX-613) and WTX-712, and claims directed to our PREDATOR platform technology. For our product candidates, we will, in general, initially pursue patent protection covering compositions of matter and methods of use. Throughout the development of our product candidates, we will seek to identify additional opportunities for obtaining patent protection that would potentially enhance commercial success, including through additional methods of use, processes for manufacture, formulation and dosing regimen-related claims.
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our current and future product candidates, platform technologies, novel discoveries, product development technologies and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing or in-licensing U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on or may rely in the future on trademarks, trade secrets, copyright protection, know-how, continuing technological innovation and confidential information to develop and maintain our proprietary position. For the product candidates we develop and plan to commercialize, as a normal course of business, we have been granted and intend to continue to pursue composition and method of manufacture and use, including therapeutic use, patents, as well as novel indications for our product candidates. We also have obtained and will continue to seek patent protection with respect to novel discoveries. We have sought and plan to continue to seek patent protection, either alone or jointly with our collaborators, as our agreements may dictate.
In some instances, we submit patent applications directly with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, as provisional patent applications. Provisional applications for patents were designed to provide a lower-cost first patent filing in the United States. Corresponding non-provisional patent applications must be filed not later than 12 months after the provisional application filing date. The corresponding non-provisional application benefits in that the priority date(s) of the patent application is/are the earlier provisional application filing date(s), and the patent term of the finally issued patent is calculated from the later non-provisional application filing date. This system allows us to obtain an early priority date, add material to the patent application(s) during the priority year, obtain a later start to the patent term and to delay prosecution costs, which may be useful in the event that we decide not to pursue examination in an application. While we intend to timely file non-provisional patent applications relating to our provisional patent applications, we cannot predict whether any such patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that provide us with any competitive advantage.
We file U.S. non-provisional applications and Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications that claim the benefit of the priority date of earlier filed provisional applications, when applicable. The PCT system allows a single application to be filed within 12 months of the original priority date of the patent application, and to designate all of the PCT member states in which national patent applications can later be pursued based on the international patent application filed under the PCT. The PCT searching authority performs a patentability search and issues a non-binding patentability opinion, which can be used to evaluate the chances of success for the national applications in foreign countries prior to having to incur the filing fees. Although a PCT application does not issue as a patent, it allows the applicant to seek protection in any of the member states through national-phase applications.
At the end of the period of two and a half years from the first priority date of the patent application, separate patent applications can be pursued in any of the PCT member states either by direct national filing or, in some cases by filing through a regional patent organization, such as the European Patent Organization. The PCT system delays expenses, allows a limited evaluation of the chances of success for national/regional patent applications and enables substantial savings where applications are abandoned within the first two and a half years of filing.
For all patent applications, we determine claiming strategy on a case-by-case basis. Advice of counsel and our business model and needs are always considered. We file patent applications containing claims for protection of all useful applications of our proprietary technologies and any products, as well as all new applications and/or uses we discover for existing technologies and products, assuming these are strategically valuable. We continuously reassess the number and type of patent applications, as well as the existing patent claims to ensure that maximum coverage and value are obtained for our processes and compositions, given existing patent office rules and regulations. Further, claims may be modified during patent prosecution to meet our intellectual property and business needs.
We recognize that the ability to obtain patent protection and the degree of such protection depends on a number of factors, including the extent of the prior art, the novelty and non-obviousness of the invention and the ability to satisfy the enablement requirement of the patent laws. The patent positions of therapeutic polypeptide companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its 
scope can be reinterpreted or further altered even after patent issuance. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our future product candidates or for our platform technology. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
Regardless of the coverage we seek under our existing patent applications, there is always a risk that an alteration to the product or process may provide sufficient basis for a competitor to avoid infringement claims. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued, and courts can reinterpret patent scope after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions, including the United States, permit third parties to challenge allowed or issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. Moreover, we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or any future applications or that any current or future issued patents will adequately protect our products.
Our patent portfolio, including patents and patent applications that we own and comprises about sixteen patent families that are in various stages of the patent application filing and examination process in various jurisdictions worldwide, and include claims to our product candidates and claims directed to our PREDATOR platform technology for potential products and developments. The status of our patent portfolio changes frequently in the ordinary course of patent prosecution. As of March 9, 2023, our patent portfolio included approximately five issued patents in the United States, approximately 16 pending U.S. provisional or non-provisional patent applications, five pending international patent applications filed under the PCT and approximately 85 pending foreign patent applications, including pending applications in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, European Patent Office, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russian Federation, Singapore, South Africa and Taiwan. These patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire on various dates from 2039 through about 2043, in each case without taking into account any possible patent term extension that may be available.
Our patent portfolio on our PREDATOR platform technology includes two patent families directed to protease cleavable linkers and libraries of protease cleavable linkers, as well as polypeptides that contain such linkers and methods of making libraries and screening libraries to identify linkers with desired properties. One of the patent families includes pending applications in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, European Patent Office, Israel, India, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico and Singapore. The 20-year term for patents in this family runs through 2040, excluding any extension of patent term that may be available. The second patent family currently consists of a pending U.S. provisional application. We plan to file an international patent application under the PCT based on this provisional application before applicable deadlines.

See the discussion under “License Agreement with Harpoon Therapeutics, Inc.”, below, and Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence, within this Annual Report for more information regarding our license agreement with Harpoon.
Patent Term and Patent Term Extensions
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In addition, in certain instances, the term of a U.S. patent can be extended to compensate a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent. The term of a patent that covers a drug, biological product or medical device approved pursuant to a pre-market approval may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review while the patent is in force. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date set for the patent. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be granted an extension and only those claims reading on the approved drug are extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. We will, in general, pursue available patent term extensions in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions that provide for patent term extensions, however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions.
Trademarks, Trade Secrets and Know-How
In connection with the ongoing development and advancement of our product candidates in the United States and various international jurisdictions, we seek to create protection for our marks and enhance their value by pursuing trademarks where available and when appropriate. In addition to patent and trademark protection, we rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees and selected consultants. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and our trade secrets and other proprietary information may be disclosed. We may not have adequate remedies for any breach and could lose our trade secrets and other proprietary information through such a breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting trade secrets, know-how and inventions.
Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. In addition, we have licensed rights under proprietary technologies of third parties to develop, manufacture and commercialize specific aspects of our future products and services. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, alter our processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. The expiration of patents or patent applications licensed from third parties or our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future technology may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention.
For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report.
License and Royalty Agreements
License Agreement with Harpoon Therapeutics, Inc.
In March 2018, we entered into an assignment and license agreement, or the Harpoon Agreement, with Harpoon, pursuant to which we assigned to Harpoon certain patents related to adoptive cell therapies and binding moieties for conditional activation of immunoglobulin and non-immunoglobulin molecules, and Harpoon assigned to us certain patents related to certain inducible polypeptides and a binding moiety for conditional activation of certain polypeptides. Harpoon also granted to us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license under certain other patents owned by Harpoon and related to certain proteins to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import products that are covered by such patents in the field of molecules comprising a certain polypeptide. Under the Harpoon Agreement, we agreed to pay to Harpoon an upfront fee of $0.5 million and, if we commercialize any products covered by these licensed patents, a low single digit percentage royalty on net sales of such products by us or any of our affiliates or licensees, subject to an obligation to make a minimum annual royalty payment at an amount in the low hundreds of thousands of dollars beginning with the first commercial sale of any such product by us.
In October 2018, we and Harpoon amended the Harpoon Agreement by entering into a First Amended and Restated Assignment and License Agreement, which amended certain terms of the original agreement, but did not change the terms of the license to the Company, patent assignments between the parties or payments due to Harpoon.
In December 2019, we and Harpoon amended the Harpoon Agreement by entering into a Second Amended and Restated Assignment and License Agreement, or the Second Amended Harpoon Agreement, which granted to us an additional worldwide, exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-bearing, transferable, assignable, sublicensable license under certain patents owned by Harpoon and related to certain proteins, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import products that are covered by such patents in the field of molecules comprising a certain protein. Under the Second Amended Harpoon Agreement, we agreed to pay to Harpoon a low single digit percentage royalty on net sales by us or any of our affiliates or licensees of any products that we commercialize covered by these additional licensed patents. In addition, we also agreed to grant to Harpoon, and Harpoon agreed to grant to us, a perpetual, non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license under certain other patents directed to a certain binding domain of a certain protein, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import products that are covered by such patents in a field defined by a certain type of molecule with respect to each party.
Unless earlier terminated, our obligations to pay any royalties under the Second Amended Harpoon Agreement will expire on a country-by-country basis upon expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the relevant patents covering the manufacture, use or sale of such covered products in the applicable country. Harpoon may terminate the Second Amended Harpoon Agreement in the event of a material breach by us and our failure to cure such breach within a specified period and may terminate certain licenses if we become insolvent or bankrupt. We may terminate the Second Amended Harpoon Agreement voluntarily with prior written notice to Harpoon.
Amended and Restated Royalty Transfer Agreement
In December 2017, in connection with our sale of convertible promissory notes, we entered into a royalty transfer agreement with MPM Oncology Impact Fund Charitable Foundation, Inc., or MPM Charitable Foundation, and UBS Optimus Foundation, or the Royalty Transfer Agreement. Under the Royalty Transfer Agreement, we agreed to pay a royalty of 0.5% of net sales of our products to each of MPM Charitable Foundation and UBS Optimus Foundation. In August 2019, we amended the Royalty Transfer Agreement by entering into an amended and restated royalty transfer agreement, or the Amended Royalty Transfer Agreement, which provided that only products in our product pipeline at the time of our initial public offering or a change in control would be subject to the royalty on net sales. Under the Amended Royalty Transfer Agreement, our obligation to pay a royalty expires on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon 
the later of the 12th anniversary of the first commercial sale of such product in such country and expiration of the last valid claim in such country covering such product. The royalty rate is subject to a specified reduction for lack of any valid claim covering such product in a country. The obligation to pay royalties under the Amended Royalty Transfer Agreement shall not apply to any product that would only infringe our intellectual property rights that are discovered or developed after this offering or to any product of an acquirer, assignee of the agreement or merger partner of the company so long as such product does not incorporate any of our pre-acquisition intellectual property.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, or EU, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, sales, pricing, reimbursement, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
Review and Approval of Drugs and Biologics in the United States
In the United States, the FDA approves and regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and related regulations. Biological products are licensed for marketing under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and subject to regulation under the FDCA and related regulations. A company, institution, or organization which takes responsibility for the initiation and management of a clinical development program for such products, and for their regulatory approval, is typically referred to as a sponsor. A sponsor seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug or biological product in the United States must typically secure the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, standards and applicable regulations;
•design of a clinical protocol and submission to the FDA of an IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin;
•approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each proposed indication;
•submission to the FDA of an NDA for a drug candidate product and a biological licensing application, or BLA, for a biological product requesting marketing for one or more proposed indications;
•review of the request for approval by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
•completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with cGMPs to assure the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
•completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
•payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA or BLA; and
•compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
Preclinical Studies
Before a sponsor begins testing a compound with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the formulated product, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the product candidate for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. These studies are generally referred to as IND-enabling studies. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP standards and regulations and the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act, if applicable. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and long-term toxicity studies, may continue after the IND is submitted.
The IND and IRB Processes
An IND is a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational product candidate to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any new drug or biologic that is not the subject of an approved NDA or BLA. In support of a request for an IND, sponsors must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects and patients will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period, or thereafter, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. The FDA’s primary objectives in reviewing an IND are to assure the safety and rights of patients and to help assure that the quality of the investigation will be adequate to permit an evaluation of the drug’s effectiveness and safety and of the biological product’s safety, purity and potency.
Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. Clinical holds are imposed by the FDA whenever there is concern for patient safety and may be a result of new data, findings, or developments in clinical, nonclinical, and/or chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, or CMC. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed.
A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all IND requirements must be met unless waived. When a foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval in the United States. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies.
In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the trial at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the trial protocol and informed consent information to be provided to trial subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, or DSMB, or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the trial. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
Human Clinical Studies in Support of an NDA or BLA
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written trial protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated.
The clinical investigation of an investigational drug or biological product is generally divided into four phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The four phases of an investigation are as follows:
•Phase 1. Phase 1 studies include the initial introduction of an investigational new drug or biological product into humans. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational drug or biological product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
•Phase 2. Phase 2 includes the controlled clinical trials conducted to preliminarily or further evaluate the effectiveness of the investigational drug or biological product for a particular indication(s) in patients with the disease or condition under trial, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the drug or biological product. Phase 2 clinical trials are typically well-controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a limited patient population.
•Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are generally controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded patient population generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug or biological product has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug or biological product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
•Phase 4. Post-approval studies may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.
A clinical trial may combine the elements of more than one phase and the FDA often requires more than one Phase 3 trial to support marketing approval of a product candidate. A company’s designation of a clinical trial as being of a particular phase is not necessarily indicative that the study will be sufficient to satisfy the FDA requirements of that phase because this determination cannot be made until the protocol and data have been submitted to and reviewed by the FDA. Generally, pivotal trials are Phase 3 trials, but they may be Phase 2 trials if the design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in an area of unmet medical need.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator 
brochure. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
In March 2022, the FDA released final guidance entitled “Expansion Cohorts: Use in First-In-Human Clinical Trials to Expedite Development of Oncology Drugs and Biologics,” which outlines how developers can utilize an adaptive trial design commonly referred to as a seamless trial design in early stages of oncology biological product development (i.e., the first-in-human clinical trial) to compress the traditional three phases of trials into one continuous trial called an expansion cohort trial. Information to support the design of individual expansion cohorts are included in IND applications and assessed by FDA. Expansion cohort trials can potentially bring efficiency to biological product development and reduce developmental costs and time.
In December 2022, with the passage of Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act, or FDORA, Congress required sponsors to develop and submit a diversity action plan for each Phase 3 clinical trial or any other “pivotal study” of a new drug or biological product. These plans are meant to encourage the enrollment of more diverse patient populations in late-stage clinical trials of FDA-regulated products. Specifically, action plans must include the sponsor’s goals for enrollment, the underlying rationale for those goals, and an explanation of how the sponsor intends to meet them. In addition to these requirements, the legislation directs the FDA to issue new guidance on diversity action plans.
Finally, sponsors of clinical trials are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public registry (clinicaltrials.gov) maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or NIH. In particular, information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. The failure to submit clinical trial information to clinicaltrials.gov, as required, is a prohibited act under the FDCA with violations subject to potential civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each day the violation continues. Although the FDA has historically not enforced these reporting requirements due to the long delay by the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, in issuing final implementing regulations, those regulations have now been issued and the FDA has issued several Notices of Noncompliance to manufacturers since April 2021.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the candidate product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
Pediatric Studies
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, an application or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Sponsors must also submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, prior to the assessment data. The PSP must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests and other information required by regulation. The sponsor, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the sponsor may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
For investigational products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the FDA must, upon the request of a sponsor, meet to discuss preparation of the initial pediatric study plan or to discuss deferral or waiver of pediatric assessments. In addition, the FDA will meet early in the development process to discuss pediatric study plans with sponsors, and the FDA must meet with sponsors by no later than the end-of-phase 1 meeting for serious or life-threatening diseases and by no later than ninety (90) days after the FDA’s receipt of the study plan.
The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the sponsor, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the product or therapeutic candidate is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric trials begin. The FDA is required to send a PREA Non-Compliance letter to sponsors who have failed to submit their pediatric assessments required under PREA, have failed to seek or obtain a deferral or deferral extension or have failed to request approval for a required pediatric formulation. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation, although the FDA has recently taken steps to limit what it considers abuse of this statutory exemption.
FDARA also established new requirements to govern certain molecularly targeted cancer indications. Any company that submits an application three years after the date of enactment of that statute must submit pediatric assessments with the application if the product is intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that the FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer. The investigation must be designed to yield clinically meaningful pediatric study data regarding the dosing, safety and preliminary efficacy to inform pediatric labeling for the product.
Submission and Review of an NDA or BLA by the FDA
In order to obtain approval to market a drug or biological product in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing the safety and effectiveness of the proposed drug product for the proposed indication, and the safety, purity and potency of the biological product for its intended indication. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials 
intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators.
The application is the vehicle through which sponsors formally propose that the FDA approve a new product for marketing and sale in the United States for one or more indications. Every new product candidate must be the subject of an approved NDA or BLA before it may be commercialized in the United States. Under federal law, the fee required for the submission and review of an application under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or the PDUFA, is substantial (for example, for fiscal year 2023 this application fee is approximately $3.25 million), and the sponsor of an approved application is also subject to an annual program fee, currently more than $394,000 per eligible prescription product. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for products with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses. If an application is withdrawn prior to the FDA acceptance for filing, 75% of these fees may be refunded to the sponsor. If an application is withdrawn after filing, a lower portion of these fees may be refunded in certain circumstances.
Following submission of an NDA or BLA, the FDA conducts a preliminary review of the application within 60 calendar days of its receipt and must inform the sponsor by that time or before whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. In the event that the FDA determines that an application does not satisfy this standard, it will issue a Refuse to File, or RTF, determination to the sponsor. The FDA may request additional information and studies and the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs and BLAs. Under that agreement, 90% of applications seeking approval of New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date on which FDA accepts the NDA for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for “priority review” are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. The review process and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the sponsor to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
In connection with its review of an application, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA or BLA submission, including drug component manufacturing (e.g., active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. 
Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP standards and the integrity of the clinical data supporting the application. With passage of FDORA, Congress clarified the FDA’s authority to conduct inspections by expressly permitting inspection of facilities involved in the preparation, conduct, or analysis of clinical and non-clinical studies submitted to the FDA as well as other persons holding study records or involved in the study process.
The FDA may also refer an application for a novel product to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
The FDA’s Decision on an NDA or BLA
After evaluating the application and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendations, if any, and inspection reports of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA will issue either a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, or an approval letter. To reach this determination, the FDA must determine that the expected benefits of the proposed product outweigh its potential risks to patients. This “benefit-risk” assessment is informed by the extensive body of evidence about the product’s safety and efficacy in the NDA or BLA.
If the FDA decides not to license or approve the application, it will issue a CRL. A CRL will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the application, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the CRL without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the CRL, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the application in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an application if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. If a CRL is issued, the applicant will have one year to respond to the deficiencies identified by the FDA, at which time the FDA can deem the application withdrawn or, in its discretion, grant the applicant an additional six month extension to respond. For those seeking to challenge the FDA’s CRL decision, the FDA has indicated that sponsors may request a formal hearing on the CRL or they may file a request for reconsideration or a request for a formal dispute resolution.
An approval letter, on the other hand, authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review Designations
The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs include fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review designation. None of these expedited programs changes the standards for approval but each may help expedite the development or approval process governing product candidates.
Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Second, a product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to help the sponsor design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.
Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.
Accelerated Approval Pathway
The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a product.
The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. Thus, the benefit of accelerated approval derives from the potential to receive approval based on surrogate endpoints sooner than possible for trials with clinical or survival endpoints, rather than deriving from any explicit shortening of the FDA approval timeline, as is the case with priority review.
The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to initiate expedited proceedings to withdraw approval of the product. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
With passage of FDORA in December 2022, Congress modified certain provisions governing accelerated approval of drug and biologic products. Specifically, the new legislation authorized the FDA to require a sponsor to have its confirmatory clinical trial underway before accelerated approval is awarded, require a sponsor of a product granted accelerated approval to submit progress reports on its post-approval 
studies to the FDA every six months until the study is completed, and use expedited procedures to withdraw accelerated approval of an NDA or BLA after the confirmatory trial fails to verify the product’s clinical benefit. Further, FDORA requires the FDA to publish on its website “the rationale for why a post-approval study is not appropriate or necessary” whenever it decides not to require such a study upon granting accelerated approval. 
Post-Approval Regulation
Drugs and biologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
In addition, manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, or complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. In September 2021, the FDA published final regulations which describe the types of evidence that it will consider in determining the intended use of a drug or biologic.
It may be permissible, under very specific, narrow conditions, for a manufacturer to engage in nonpromotional, non-misleading communication regarding off-label information, such as distributing scientific or medical journal information. Moreover, with passage of the Pre-Approval Information Exchange Act, or PIE Act, in December 2022, sponsors of products that have not been approved may proactively communicate to payors certain information about products in development to help expedite patient access upon product approval. Previously, such communications were permitted under FDA guidance, but the new legislation explicitly provides protection to sponsors who convey certain information about products in development to payors, including unapproved uses of approved products.
If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products.
Generic Drugs
In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs. To obtain approval of a generic drug, a sponsor must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the FDA. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, bioequivalence, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. ANDAs are “abbreviated” because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, in support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference-listed drug, or RLD.
Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. This interpretation of the FDCA by the FDA was confirmed with enactment of the Ensuring Innovation Act in April 2021. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In 
cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the sponsor may submit its application four years following the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the sponsor and are essential to the approval of the application.
Biosimilars
The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010, included a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA. The BPCIA established a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. To date, the FDA has approved a number of biosimilars and several interchangeable biosimilar products.
Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is “biosimilar to” or “interchangeable with” a previously approved biological product or “reference product.” In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the FDA must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product, and (for products administered multiple times) that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. In December 2022, Congress clarified through FDORA that the FDA may approve multiple first interchangeable biosimilar biological products so long as the products are all approved on the first day on which such a product is approved as interchangeable with the reference product.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date of approval of the reference product. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was approved. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. There have been recent government proposals to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period, but none has been enacted to date. At the same time, since passage of the BPCIA, many states have passed laws or amendments to laws, which address pharmacy practices involving biosimilar products.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. A company must request orphan drug designation before submitting an NDA or BLA for the candidate product. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the PDUFA goal dates for the regulatory review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and exemption from the PDUFA application fee.
If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different product for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same product for different indications. If a drug or biologic designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand and in cases where a subsequent product with the same drug or biologic for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care. Under Omnibus legislation signed by President Trump on December 27, 2020, the requirement for a subsequent product to show clinical superiority in order to break the previous product’s orphan drug exclusivity applies to drugs and biologics that received orphan drug designation before enactment of FDARA in 2017 but have not yet been approved or licensed by FDA.
In September 2021, the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit held that, for the purpose of determining the scope of market exclusivity, the term “same disease or condition” in the statute means the designated “rare disease or condition” and could not be interpreted by the FDA to mean the “indication or use.” Thus, the court concluded, orphan drug exclusivity applies to the entire designated disease or condition rather than the “indication or use.” Although there have been legislative proposals to overrule this decision, they have not been enacted into law. On January 23, 2023, the FDA announced that, in matters beyond the scope of that court order, the FDA will continue to apply its existing regulations tying orphan-drug exclusivity to the uses or indications for which the orphan drug was approved.
Pediatric Exclusivity
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of regulatory exclusivity. For drug products, the six-month exclusivity may be attached to the term of any existing patent or regulatory exclusivity. For biologic products, the six-month period may only be attached to any existing regulatory exclusivities but not to any patent terms. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA or BLA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a 
written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of non-patent exclusivity for drugs and biologics, or patent protection that covers a drug product, are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application.
Patent Term Restoration and Extension
A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of the IND approval and the submission date of an application, plus the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product candidate could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.
Healthcare Law and Regulation
Health care providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, patient privacy laws and regulations and other health care laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements.
Restrictions under applicable federal and state health care laws and regulations, include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program such as Medicare and Medicaid; the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make, improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment; and the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. As of January 1, 2022, these federal transparency reporting obligations were extended to include transfers of value made during the previous year to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives. In addition, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended, among other things, imposes limitations on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses and their respective business associates and their covered subcontractors that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.
Further, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information 
related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. Additionally, some state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives in the jurisdiction.
State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. In particular, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information.
Violation of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations may result in significant penalties, including civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, imprisonment, and additional reporting requirements and oversight if a manufacturer becomes subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws. Furthermore, efforts to ensure that business activities and business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations can be costly.
Healthcare Reform
The containment of health care costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and biologics and other medical products, government control and other changes to the health care system in the United States. In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the PPACA, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress including aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2032. These Medicare sequester reductions were suspended and reduced through the end of June 2022, with the full 2% cut resuming thereafter. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, which was signed into law by President Biden in December 2022, made several changes to sequestration of the Medicare program. Section 1001 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act delays the 4% Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, or PAYGO, sequester for two years, through the end of calendar year 2024. Triggered by enactment of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, the 4% cut to the Medicare program would have taken effect in January 2023. The Consolidated Appropriations Act’s health care offset title includes Section 4163, which extends the 2% Budget Control Act of 2011 Medicare sequester for six months into fiscal year 2032 and lowers the payment reduction percentages in fiscal years 2030 and 2031.
Since enactment of the PPACA, there have been, and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the TCJA, which was signed by President Trump on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019. In December 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the PPACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the PPACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the TCJA, the remaining provisions of the PPACA are invalid as well. After appeal, in June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed this action after finding that the plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the ACA. Litigation and legislation over the PPACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.
The Trump Administration also took executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the ACA, including directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. However, President Biden’s Executive Order issued on January 28, 2021 rescinded the Executive Orders issued by President Trump and directs federal agencies to reconsider rules and other policies that limit Americans’ access to health care, and consider actions that will protect and strengthen that access. Under this Executive Order, federal agencies are directed to re-examine: policies that undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, including complications related to COVID-19; demonstrations and waivers under Medicaid and the ACA that may reduce coverage or undermine the programs, including work requirements; policies that undermine the Health Insurance Marketplace or other markets for health insurance; policies that make it more difficult to enroll in Medicaid and the ACA; and policies that reduce affordability of coverage or financial assistance, including for dependents.
Pharmaceutical Price Reform
The prices of prescription pharmaceuticals have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States. There have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more 
transparency to pharmaceutical pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reduce the costs of pharmaceuticals under Medicare and Medicaid. In 2020, President Trump issued several executive orders intended to lower the costs of prescription products and certain provisions in these orders have been incorporated into regulations. These regulations include an interim final rule implementing a most favored nation model for prices that would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered pharmaceuticals to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. That rule, however, has been subject to a nationwide preliminary injunction and, on December 29, 2021, CMS issued a final rule to rescind it. With issuance of this rule, CMS stated that it will explore all options to incorporate value into payments for Medicare Part B pharmaceuticals and improve beneficiaries' access to evidence-based care.
In addition, in October 2020, HHS and the FDA published a final rule allowing states and other entities to develop a Section 804 Importation Program, or SIP, to import certain prescription drugs from Canada into the United States. The final rule is currently the subject of ongoing litigation, but at least six states (Vermont, Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Mexico, and New Hampshire) have passed laws allowing for the importation of drugs from Canada with the intent of developing SIPs for review and approval by the FDA. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The final rule would eliminate the current safe harbor for Medicare drug rebates and create new safe harbors for beneficiary point-of-sale discounts and pharmacy benefit manager, or PBM, service fees. It originally was set to go into effect on January 1, 2022, but with passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or the IRA, has been delayed by Congress to January 1, 2032.
On July 9, 2021, President Biden signed Executive Order 14063, which focuses on, among other things, the price of pharmaceuticals. The Order directs HHS to create a plan within 45 days to combat “excessive pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals and enhance domestic pharmaceutical supply chains, to reduce the prices paid by the federal government for such pharmaceuticals, and to address the recurrent problem of price gouging.” On September 9, 2021, HHS released its plan to reduce pharmaceutical prices. The key features of that plan are to: (a) make pharmaceutical prices more affordable and equitable for all consumers and throughout the health care system by supporting pharmaceutical price negotiations with manufacturers; (b) improve and promote competition throughout the prescription pharmaceutical industry by supporting market changes that strengthen supply chains, promote biosimilars and generic drugs, and increase transparency; and (c) foster scientific innovation to promote better healthcare and improve health by supporting public and private research and making sure that market incentives promote discovery of valuable and accessible new treatments.
More recently, on August 16, 2022, the IRA was signed into law by President Biden. The new legislation has implications for Medicare Part D, which is a program available to individuals who are entitled to Medicare Part A or enrolled in Medicare Part B to give them the option of paying a monthly premium for outpatient prescription drug coverage. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap, imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023), and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years.
Specifically, with respect to price negotiations, Congress authorized Medicare to negotiate lower prices for certain costly single-source drug and biologic products that do not have competing generics or biosimilars and are reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. CMS may negotiate prices for ten high-cost drugs paid for by Medicare Part D starting in 2026, followed by 15 Part D drugs in 2027, 15 Part B or Part D drugs in 2028, and 20 Part B or Part D drugs in 2029 and beyond. This provision applies to drug products that have been approved for at least nine years and biologics that have been licensed for 13 years, but it does not apply to drugs and biologics that have been approved for a single rare disease or condition. Further, the legislation subjects drug manufacturers to civil monetary penalties and a potential excise tax for failing to comply with the legislation by offering a price that is not equal to or less than the negotiated “maximum fair price” under the law or for taking price increases that exceed inflation. The legislation also requires manufacturers to pay rebates for drugs in Medicare Part D whose price increases exceed inflation. The new law also caps Medicare out-of-pocket drug costs at an estimated $4,000 a year in 2024 and, thereafter beginning in 2025, at $2,000 a year.
At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. A number of states, for example, require drug manufacturers and other entities in the drug supply chain, including health carriers, pharmacy benefit managers, wholesale distributors, to disclose information about pricing of pharmaceuticals. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
