ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
As used in this Annual Report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “Broadwind” and the “Company” refer to Broadwind, Inc., a Delaware corporation headquartered in Cicero, Illinois, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the “Subsidiaries”). Dollars are presented in thousands unless otherwise stated.
 
Business Overview
 
Broadwind is a precision manufacturer of structures, equipment and components for clean technology and other specialized applications. We provide technologically advanced high value products to customers with complex systems and stringent quality standards that operate in energy, mining and infrastructure sectors, primarily in the United States of America (the “U.S.”). Our capabilities include but are not limited to the following: heavy fabrications, welding, metal rolling, coatings, gear cutting and shaping, gearbox manufacturing and repair, heat treat, assembly, engineering and packaging solutions.
 
We were incorporated in 1996 in Nevada as Blackfoot Enterprises, Inc., and through a series of subsequent transactions, became Broadwind Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation, in 2008. Through acquisitions in 2007 and 2008, we focused on expanding upon our core platform as a wind tower manufacturer, established our Gearing segment, and developed and broadened our industrial fabrications capabilities. In early 2017, we acquired Red Wolf Company, LLC, a kitter and assembler of industrial components primarily supporting the global gas turbine market. In 2020, we rebranded to Broadwind, Inc., a reflection of our diversification progress to date and our continued strategy to expand our product and customer diversification outside of wind energy. Effective with our 2020 rebranding, we renamed certain segments. Our Towers and Heavy Fabrications segment was renamed to Heavy Fabrications and our Process Systems segment was renamed to Industrial Solutions. Our Gearing segment name remained the same.
 
Heavy Fabrications
 
We provide large, complex and precision fabrications to customers in a broad range of industrial markets. Our most significant presence is within the U.S. wind energy industry, although we have diversified into other industrial markets in order to improve our capacity utilization, reduce our customer concentration, and reduce our exposure to uncertainty related to governmental policies currently impacting the U.S. wind energy industry. Within the U.S. wind energy industry, we provide steel towers and repowering adapters primarily to wind turbine manufacturers. Our production facilities, located in Manitowoc, Wisconsin and Abilene, Texas, are situated in close proximity to the primary U.S. domestic wind energy and equipment manufacturing hubs. The two facilities have a combined annual tower production capacity of up to approximately 550 towers (1650 tower sections), sufficient to support turbines generating more than 1,100 MW of power. We have expanded our production capabilities and leveraged our manufacturing competencies, including welding, lifting capacity and stringent quality practices, into aftermarket and original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) components utilized in surface and underground mining, construction, material handling, oil and gas (“O&G”) and other infrastructure markets. We manufacture components for buckets, shovels, car bodies, drill masts and other products that support mining and construction markets. In other industrial markets, we provide crane components, pressure vessels, frames and other structures.
Gearing
 
We provide gearing and gearboxes to a broad set of customers in diverse markets including; onshore and offshore O&G fracking and drilling, surface and underground mining, wind energy, steel, material handling, infrastructure, marine and other industrial markets. We provide gearbox repair services and have manufactured loose gearing, gearboxes and systems, and provided heat treat services for aftermarket and OEM applications for nearly a century. While a significant portion of our business is manufactured to our customer’s specifications, we employ design and metallurgical engineers to meet our customer’s stringent quality requirements, to improve product performance, and reliability and to develop custom products that are integrated into our customer’s product offerings.
Industrial Solutions
 
We provide supply chain solutions, light fabrication, inventory management, kitting and assembly services, primarily serving the combined cycle natural gas turbine market. We have recently expanded our market reach into the solar power generation market by leveraging our existing core competencies. We leverage a global supply chain to provide instrumentation & controls, valve assemblies, sensor devices, fuel system components, electrical junction boxes & wiring, energy storage services and electromechanical devices. We also provide packaging solutions and fabricate panels and sub-assemblies to reduce our customers’ costs, improve manufacturing velocity and reliability.

Business and Operating Strategy
 
We intend to capitalize on the markets for wind energy, gas turbines, O&G, mining, and other industrial verticals in North America by leveraging our core competencies in welding, manufacturing, assembling and kitting. Our strategic objectives include the following, many of which are subject to risks and uncertainties that are, and have been, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and any worsening of the global business and economic environment as a result:

● | Diversify our customer and product line concentrations. In 2022, sales derived from our top five customers represented 69% of total sales and sales into the wind energy industry represented 48% of total sales. This is an improvement as compared to 2017, when our top five customers comprised 85% of total sales and sales in the wind energy industry represented 72% of total sales. To reduce the concentration of our sales, we have focused our product development activities and our sales force on expanding and diversifying our customer base and product lines. We are leveraging existing customer relationships within each of our segments to cross sell our broad portfolio of capabilities. We utilize a stage gate model for new product development, which provides a framework for evaluating opportunities and commercialization. Additionally, we continue to use new customer and product revenues as metrics within our variable executive compensation programs. Our diversification efforts are impacted in part by the end-market demand outlook.

● | Improve capacity utilization and broaden our manufacturing capabilities. Subject to labor availability, we have manufacturing capacity available that could support a significant increase in our annual revenues for heavy fabrications, gearing and industrial solutions. We are working to improve our capacity utilization and financial results by leveraging our existing manufacturing capacity and adjusting capacity where we can, in response to changing market conditions. In our Heavy Fabrications segment, we have expanded production capabilities and leveraged our fabrication competencies to support growth in mining, material handling, and other industrial markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pursue opportunistic acquisitions as well as organic investments. In addition to existing business and operating strategies, we are endeavoring to identify, and opportunistically execute on, accretive acquisitions and organic investments that will allow us to achieve further growth. Our investment criteria for opportunistic acquisitions as well as organic investments include, among other things, our ability to: improve manufacturing competencies, support our existing capacity utilization strategy, enhance our diversification strategy and/or augment our penetration into renewable markets. Additionally, we are developing new variations of our Pressure Reducing Systems (“PRS”) unit which supplies compressed natural gas to regions without established infrastructure as part of the virtual pipeline. We believe that execution of our investment strategy provides significant opportunity to generate stockholder value, through profitable growth and leveraging a significant unrealized economic asset, over $288 million of net operating losses (“NOLs”) as of December 31, 2022 which can be used to cover future prospective tax liabilities.

● | Streamline front-end processes to operational efficiency. We believe that the proper coordination and integration of the supply chain, consistent use of systems to manage our production activities and “Continuous Improvement” initiatives are key factors that enable high operating efficiencies, increased reliability, better delivery and lower costs. We utilize robust Advanced Product Quality Processes (APQP) to support the introduction of new products. We have developed better supply chain expertise, worked with lean enterprise resources, upgraded and improved systems utilization and invested capital to enhance our operational efficiency and flexibility. We have implemented scheduling software and have expanded our engineering organization to support the growing complexity of our expanded customer base and product lines. We have staffed our operations with Continuous Improvement experts in order to optimize our production processes to increase output, leverage our scale and lower our costs while maintaining product quality. During 2022 and 2021, supply chain and staffing constraints caused by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in increased manufacturing inefficiencies.

SALES AND MARKETING
 
We market our heavy fabrications, gearing, and industrial solutions through a direct sales force, supplemented with independent sales agents in certain markets. Our sales and marketing strategy is to develop and maintain long-term relationships with our existing customers, and seek opportunities to expand these relationships across our business units. Our business development team uses market data, including marketing databases, information gathered at industry and trade shows, internet research and website marketing to identify and target new customers.

CUSTOMERS
 
We manufacture products for a variety of customers in the wind energy, O&G, gas turbine, mining, and other industrial markets. Within the wind energy industry, our customer base consists primarily of wind turbine manufacturers who supply end users and wind farm operators with wind turbines, and wind gearbox re-manufacturers who use our replacement gears in their replacement gearboxes. The wind turbine market is very concentrated. According to Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables 2022 industry data, the top four wind turbine manufacturers comprised approximately 90% of the U.S. market. As a result, although we have historically produced towers for a broad range of wind turbine manufacturers, in any given year a limited number of customers have accounted for the majority of our revenues. Within the O&G and mining industries, our customer base consists of manufacturers of hydraulic fracturing and mud pumps, drilling and production equipment, mining equipment, and off highway vehicles. Within the gas turbine industry, our customers supply end-users with natural gas turbines and after-market replacement and efficiency upgrade packages. Within our other industrial markets served, our customer base includes steel producers, ship builders, and manufacturers of material handling, pulp and paper and other power generation equipment. Sales to Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (“SGRE”) and GE Renewable Energy each represented greater than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The loss of one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation or financial condition. As a result, we have an ongoing initiative to diversify our customer base.
COMPETITION
 
Each of our businesses faces competition from both domestic and international companies. In recent years, the industrial gearing industry has experienced consolidation of producers and acquisitions by strategic buyers in response to strong international competition, although recent tariff and supply chain uncertainties have caused buyers to shift more of their purchases to domestic gear manufacturers. 
 
Within the wind tower product line of our Heavy Fabrications segment, the largest North American based competitor is Arcosa Inc., which was formerly a Trinity Industries company. Other competitors include C.S. Wind, a South Korean Company, Marmen Industries, a Canadian company, and GRI Renewable Industries, a Spanish company, each of which have production facilities in the U.S. We also face competition from imported towers, although in recent years a number of trade cases have periodically significantly reduced competition from imports. 
 
Imports from China and Vietnam have declined following a determination by the U.S. International Trade Commission (“USITC”) in 2013 that wind towers from those countries were being sold in the U.S. at less than fair value. As a result of the determination, the U.S. Department of Commerce (“USDOC”) issued antidumping and countervailing duty orders on imports of wind towers from China and an antidumping duty order on imports of towers from Vietnam. In May 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the decision from the U.S. Court of International Trade and at the same time excluded CS Wind Vietnam from the antidumping order. In April 2019, the USDOC extended the term of these duties for an additional five-year period. Following a renewed surge of tower imports from countries not impacted by existing tariffs, in July 2020, the USDOC issued antidumping and countervailing duty orders on imports of wind towers from Canada, Indonesia, and Vietnam and an antidumping order on imports of towers from Korea.  Then in September 2020, a new trade case was brought before the USDOC and USITC, to assess whether wind towers imported from India, Malaysia, and Spain were being sold in the U.S. at less than fair value. The USDOC and USITC issued affirmative final determinations in all three antidumping (India, Malaysia, and Spain) and two countervailing duty cases (India and Malaysia). The USDOC imposed orders for two cases in August 2021 and the remainder in December 2021. Appeals of several of the USDOC determinations are currently pending at the CIT and the CAFC.

Within our industrial fabrications product line of our Heavy Fabrications segment, our competitors in a fragmented market include Weldall Manufacturing and AT&F Advanced Metals, along with a large number of other regional competitors. The primary differentiator among fabricators is the range of manufacturing and machining capabilities, including lifting capacity, precision machining, heat treatment capacity and the sophistication of quality systems.
 
In our Gearing segment, which is focused on O&G, wind energy, mining and steel markets, we compete with domestic and international manufacturers who produce gears greater than one meter in diameter. Our key competitors include Overton Chicago Gear, Cincinnati Gearing Systems, Milwaukee Gear and Horsburgh & Scott. In addition, we compete with the internal gear manufacturing capacity of relevant equipment manufacturers and face competition from foreign competitors.
 
In our Industrial Solutions segment, which is primarily focused on the gas turbine market, we compete with electrical supply distributors. Our key competitors include Gexpro and other small independent companies.
 
REGULATION
 
Production Tax Credit/Investment Tax Credit
 
The most impactful development incentive for our products has been the production tax credit (“PTC”) for new wind energy projects, which provides federal income tax credits based on electricity produced from qualifying wind turbines. Legislative support for the PTC has been intermittent since its introduction in 1992, which has caused volatility in the demand for new wind energy projects. 
 
In December 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (“COVID IV”), a $2.3 trillion spending bill that combines a $1.4 trillion omnibus spending bill for federal fiscal year 2021 with $900 billion in stimulus relief for the COVID-19 pandemic was signed into law. As part of COVID IV, the PTC was extended for an additional year, allowing for a 60% credit for projects that start construction by the end of 2021.  In order to benefit from the PTC, qualifying projects must either be completed within four years from their start of construction, or the developer must demonstrate that its projects are in continuous construction between start of construction and completion. As a result of COVID IV, the PTC will subsidize wind projects commenced as late as 2021 and completed by 2025, or later if continuous construction can be demonstrated. Included in COVID IV is the addition of a new 30% investment tax credit (“ITC”) created for offshore wind projects that start construction by the end of 2025.  The provision will retroactively apply to projects that started production in 2016.
 
On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) was enacted to reduce inflation and promote clean energy in the United States. The IRA modifies and extends the PTC until the later of 2032 or when greenhouse gas emissions have been reduced by 75% compared to 2022. It provides for tax credits up to a maximum of 30%, adjusted for inflation annually, for electricity generated from qualified renewable energy sources where taxpayers meet prevailing wage standards and employ a sufficient proportion of qualified apprentices from registered apprenticeship programs. It also provides a bonus credit for qualifying clean energy production in energy communities. 
 
The IRA also includes advanced manufacturing tax credits for manufacturers of eligible components, including wind and solar components (“45X credits”). Manufacturers qualify for the 45X credits based on the electricity output for each component produced and sold in the US starting in 2023 through 2032. The credit amount varies based on the eligible component, which includes solar components, wind energy components, inverters, qualifying battery components, and critical minerals. Tower manufacturers are eligible for credits of $0.03 per watt for applicable components produced. Manufacturers can apply to the Internal Revenue Service for cash refunds of the 45X credits for up to five years. After the first five years, the 45X credits are transferable and can be sold to third parties for cash. We are waiting for the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury Department to provide implementation guidance for the legislation. 
 
Investment in Infrastructure
 
In November 2021, the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (“IIJA”) was signed into law. The IIJA provides for $548 billion in new infrastructure spending over the next five years and $650 billion in previously allocated funds. The IIJA allocated $62 billion to the Department of Energy for various projects focused on clean energy resources and expanding renewable energy. However the timing of the award of projects funded by the IIJA is uncertain thus the impact on our business is uncertain.
Occupational Safety and Health Administration
 
Our operations are subject to regulation of health and safety matters by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. We believe that we take appropriate precautions to protect our employees and third parties from workplace injuries and harmful exposure to materials handled and managed at our facilities. However, claims asserted in the future against the Company for work-related injury or illnesses could increase our costs.
 
    8 

  

Environmental
 
Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Although it is our objective to maintain compliance with these laws and regulations, it may not be possible to quantify with certainty the potential impact of actions involving environmental matters, particularly remediation and other compliance efforts that we may undertake in the future.
BACKLOG
 
We sell our towers under either supply agreements or individual purchase orders (“POs”), depending on the size and duration of the purchase commitment. Under the supply agreements, we typically receive a purchase commitment for towers to be delivered in future fiscal quarters, then receive POs on a periodic basis depending upon the customer’s forecast of production volume requirements within the contract terms. For our Gearing and Industrial Solutions segments, sales are generally based on individual POs. As of December 31, 2022, the dollar amount of our backlog believed to be firm was approximately $297 million. This represents a 179% increase from the backlog at December 31, 2021. Backlog as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 is net of revenue recognized over time as described in Note 2, “Revenues” of our consolidated financial statements.
SEASONALITY
 
The majority of our business is not affected by seasonality.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
We had 499 U.S.-based employees at December 31, 2022, of which 451 were in manufacturing related functions and 48 were in administrative functions. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 19% of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with local unions in our Cicero, Illinois and Neville Island, Pennsylvania locations. We anticipate that the collective bargaining agreements with our union members will be renewed through contract renegotiation near the contract expiration dates, although there can be no assurance that any such agreements will be concluded. The collective bargaining agreement with the Neville Island union was renegotiated in November 2022 and is expected to remain in effect through October 2026. A four-year collective bargaining agreement in regards to the Cicero, Illinois facility was negotiated in February 2022 and is expected to remain in effect through February 2026. We believe that our relationship with our employees is generally positive. The table below summarizes our employees as of December 31, 2022:

 | Number of Employees As of | 
---------------------+---------------------------+----
Segment | December 31, 2022 | 
Heavy Fabrications | | 309
Gearing | | 134
Industrial Solutions | | 42 
Corporate | | 14 
Total | | 499

RAW MATERIALS
 
The primary raw material used in the construction of heavy fabrication and gearing products is steel in the form of plate, bar stock, forgings and castings. The market for tower steel and internal packages has become increasingly globalized. Although we are generally responsible for procurement of the raw materials, our global tower customers often negotiate the prices and terms for purchases, and, through a “directed buy”, we purchase under these agreements. We then pass the raw material cost through to our end customer plus a conversion margin.
 
    9 

  

Outside of these directed buys, we operate a multiple supplier sourcing strategy and source our raw materials through various suppliers located throughout the U.S. and abroad. We do not have long term supply agreements with our raw material suppliers, and closely match terms with those of our customers to limit our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. We have made modifications to our supply chain management practices to deal more effectively with potential disruptions arising from these purchasing practices.
 
Although we have been affected by global supply chain issues that are at least partially a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that we will be able to obtain an adequate supply of steel and other raw materials in 2023 to meet our manufacturing requirements. From time to time we have faced shortages of specific grades of steel, internal packages and delays associated with other materials from foreign sources including shortages and delays resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
QUALITY CONTROL
 
We have a long-standing focus on processes for ensuring the manufacture of high-quality products. To achieve high standards of production and operational quality, we implement strict and extensive quality control and inspections throughout our production processes. We maintain internal quality controls over all core manufacturing processes and carry out quality assurance inspections at the completion of each major manufacturing step to ensure the quality of our products. The manufacturing process at our Gearing segment, for example, involves transforming forged steel into precision gears through cutting, heat treating, testing and finishing. We inspect and test raw materials before they enter the assembly process, retest the raw materials after rough machining, test the functioning of gear teeth and cores after thermal treatment and accuracy test final outputs for compliance with product specifications. We believe our investment in industry leading heat treatment, high precision machining, specialized grinding technologies and cutting-edge welding has contributed to our high product reliability and the consistent performance of our products under varying operating conditions. All of our core operating facilities are ISO 9001:2015 certified.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS
 
We utilize standardized information technology systems across all areas of quoting and estimating, enterprise resource planning, materials resource planning, capacity planning and accounting, project execution and financial controls. We provide information technology oversight and support from our corporate headquarters in Cicero, IL. The operational information systems we employ throughout the Company are industry-specific applications that in some cases have been internally developed or modified by the vendor and improved to fit our operations. Our enterprise resource planning software is integrated with our operational information systems wherever possible to deliver relevant and real-time operational data. We believe our information systems provide our people with the tools to execute their individual job function and achieve our strategic initiatives.
WORKING CAPITAL
 
We sell to a broad range of industrial customers. In general, we produce to order rather than to stock. For wind towers, our largest product line, the industry has historically used customized contracts with varying terms and conditions between suppliers and customers, depending on the specific objectives of each party. Our practices mirror this historical industry practice of negotiating agreements on a case- by-case basis. As a result, working capital needs, including levels of accounts receivable (“A/R”), accounts payable (“A/P”), and inventory, can vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on the contractual terms associated with each quarter’s sales, such as whether and when we are required to purchase and supply steel to meet our contractual obligations. Customer deposits can vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on customer mix, contractual terms associated with each quarter’s sales and the timing impacts associated with customers placing orders for future production. In recent years, our larger customers have increasingly used supplier financing programs, whereby a third-party lender advances customer payments to us net of an interest charge. The combination of customer deposits and supplier financing programs arrangements may significantly reduce our working capital requirements.
 
In analyzing our liquidity, an important short-term metric is our use of operating working capital (“OWC”) in relation to revenue. OWC is comprised of A/R and inventories, net of A/P and customer deposits. Our OWC at December 31, 2022 was $475, or 0.3% of trailing three months of sales annualized, compared to December 31, 2021, when OWC was $18,635, or 18% of trailing three months of sales annualized.  The decrease in OWC was driven primarily by the timing and level of customer deposits received for future scheduled production.
