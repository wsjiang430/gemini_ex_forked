Item 1. Business
Overview
Samsara is on a mission to increase the safety, efficiency and sustainability of the operations that power the global economy.
To realize this vision, we pioneered the Connected Operations Cloud, which is a system of record that enables businesses that depend on physical operations to harness Internet of Things (“IoT”) data to develop actionable business insights and improve their operations.
Businesses in industries like transportation, wholesale and retail trade, construction, field services, logistics, utilities and energy, government, healthcare and education, manufacturing, food and beverage, and others are the backbone of the global economy. They operate high-value assets, coordinate large field workforces, manage complex logistics and distributed sites, and face environmental, safety and other regulatory requirements. We estimate that these industries represented over 40% of the global GDP in 2022. Yet historically, these industries have been underserved by technology, leaving them heavily reliant on manual processes and legacy systems that are siloed and lack cloud connectivity. Without connected digital tools, physical operations businesses struggle to access real-time data, making it nearly impossible to achieve complete operational visibility or drive meaningful improvements in productivity.
We are solving the problem of opaque operations and disconnected systems. By harnessing recent advancements in IoT connectivity, artificial intelligence (“AI”), cloud computing and video imagery, we are enabling the digital transformation of physical operations. Using our Connected Operations Cloud, customers can visualize their physical operations in real-time, on one integrated platform in a way that would have been impossible and impractical only a few years ago.
Our Connected Operations Cloud consolidates data from our IoT devices and a growing ecosystem of connected assets and third-party systems, and makes it easy for organizations to access, analyze and act on data insights, using our cloud dashboard, custom alerts and reports, mobile apps and workflows. Our differentiated, purpose-built suite of solutions enables organizations to embrace and deploy a digital, cloud-connected strategy across their operations. With Samsara, customers have the ability to drive safer operations, increase business efficiency, and achieve their sustainability goals, all to improve the lives of their employees and the customers they serve.
We provide an end-to-end solution for operations. Our solution connects physical operations data to our Connected Operations Cloud, which consists of our Data Platform and Applications. Our Data Platform ingests, aggregates, and enriches data from our IoT devices and a growing ecosystem of connected assets and third-party systems, and makes the data actionable for use cases through our Applications.
Our Connected Operations Cloud captures data that was previously siloed and difficult to analyze in several different ways. For the many physical assets that are still offline, our solution includes IoT devices that capture data and connect it to the cloud. For the physical assets that are increasingly embedded with cloud connectivity, we partner with original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) to capture data via application programming interfaces (“APIs”). Data may also be captured from customer enterprise applications or local software systems. This operational and IT data is ingested into our Data Platform, where it is aggregated, enriched, and analyzed using embedded functionality for AI, workflows and analytics, alerts, API connections, and data security and privacy. Our Data Platform powers our Applications, which include solutions for Video-Based Safety, Vehicle Telematics, Apps and Driver Workflows, Equipment Monitoring, and Site Visibility. Our Data Platform also empowers developers via an open API and provides enhanced privacy and security features that are tailored to our Applications.
Our customers range from small and medium-sized businesses to state and local governments and large, global enterprises with complex operations involving thousands of physical assets. As of January 28, 2023, we had over 19,000 Core Customers, who are customers with subscriptions to our Connected Operations Cloud representing over $5,000 in annual recurring revenue (“ARR”).1 While our Connected Operations Cloud is accessible to customers of all sizes, we are particularly focused on larger customers representing over $100,000 in ARR. As of January 28, 2023, we had 1,237 customers representing over $100,000 in ARR, and we believe there is still significant room for growth.
1 ARR is calculated as the annualized value of subscription contracts that have commenced revenue recognition as of the end of the reporting period.
Unlike retail, advertising, media, and information technology, which have already undergone digital transformation, industries with physical operations are still in the early stages of digital adoption. Historically, the ability to connect their assets to the internet has been limited by the physical nature of these industries. Often, the systems used in these industries are closed, cumbersome, and require manual data entry, which leads to inefficient use that, in turn, causes safety, efficiency, and sustainability issues. In addition, the cost and availability of sensors, compute capability, storage, video, and analytical processing have prevented widespread analysis of physical operations data. However, with advancements in IoT connectivity, cloud computing, video imagery, and AI, we believe industries that depend on physical operations are at the precipice of a massive wave of digital adoption. Samsara is enabling this transformation.
Our ability to capture, aggregate, and analyze IoT data is our key differentiator. This allows us to turn IoT data into actionable business insights, which deliver significant value to our customers. In fiscal year 2023, our Data Platform collected approximately six trillion data points, including video footage, people and motion detection, GPS location, energy consumption, asset utilization, compliance logs, accelerometer and gyroscope data, and engine diagnostics. This immense data set powers our AI and provides our customers with valuable insights that improve the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of their operations. Our system of record enables operations to achieve higher utilization of physical assets, reduced need for manual oversight, improved safety outcomes, lower insurance costs, fuel and electricity savings, emissions reductions, less unplanned downtime, efficiencies from routing and scheduling, minimized compliance costs, and automation of manual processes. Our Connected Operations Cloud benefits from powerful network effects. As more customers adopt our solution, we collect more data from a more diverse set of physical assets and software applications, thereby improving our machine learning models and generating better operational insights that make our Connected Operations Cloud more attractive to customers.
Customers typically adopt our solution to automate business processes and improve efficiencies throughout their organizations. By using Samsara’s Connected Operations Cloud, our customers are able to realize significant improvements in their operations that are reflected in their cost savings, improved safety and compliance records, and superior end-customer experience. These improvements can lead to improved profitability and durable revenue growth for our customers.

Our solution is typically self-installed and can be fully deployed and configured in as little as one hour. Our IoT devices are designed to last several years in the field and generally include dual-SIM cards for greater flexibility to connect to the best available network.
We generally use off-the-shelf components and outsource the manufacturing of our IoT devices to joint design manufacturers, most of whom produce our devices in their facilities in Taiwan, with secondary locations such as Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Thailand. We believe that using outsourced manufacturing enables greater scale and flexibility at lower costs than establishing our own manufacturing facilities. Our use of off-the-shelf components requires that we rely on the inventory availability of third parties, which may be affected by global component shortages. We expect that the need for our IoT devices will diminish over time as physical asset OEMs begin to produce connected assets that can connect to our Connected Operations Cloud without additional IoT devices provided by us.
Security and Privacy by Design
We have designed and developed our Connected Operations Cloud from the ground up with privacy and security in mind. We provide customers with customizable privacy control measures, features, and tools to help them meet the specific privacy requirements, standards, and applicable jurisdiction-specific legislation they may be subject to (including the GDPR, UKDPA, and CCPA, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”)). Our teams conduct privacy impact assessments, monitor guidance from industry and privacy experts, and interpret privacy legislation from relevant regulatory bodies. We use this input to update the privacy and security features of our Connected Operations Cloud, develop new features and Applications, and give our customers the tools they need to meet their privacy goals.
Our Connected Operations Cloud is designed to deliver a robust and ready-to-use security infrastructure to our customers, who can leverage our features to enhance their own security programs without needing to have deep security expertise. We use industry standards and protocols to protect customer data, whether in transit (including TLS 1.2 and 256-bit AES encryption) or at rest in our hosted infrastructure (including FIPS 140-2 compliant encryption standards). Our security program is designed to identify and mitigate risks, and we constantly look to implement best practices and evaluate ways to improve our security. We are regularly audited and assessed pursuant to the System and Organization Controls (SOC 2) established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for reporting on internal control environments implemented within an organization, which helps keep our customers’ data safe and available. We engage independent entities to conduct platform, infrastructure, and hardware-level penetration tests on at least an annual basis. We have also implemented a public bug bounty program to facilitate responsible disclosure of potential security vulnerabilities, which are identified by external researchers who are rewarded for their verified findings; our internal security team then works on addressing these vulnerabilities as appropriate.
App Marketplace and APIs
Samsara’s integration ecosystem includes over 220 pre-built integrations in our App Marketplace. This robust ecosystem of third-party integrations drives improved efficiency and insight for customers by unifying and analyzing data across multiple, previously siloed systems. To ensure easy adoption and seamless access for our developers, we have created “Getting Started” guides for all of our main integration types and we maintain a developer metrics page to monitor integration health, provide a newsletter and discussion forum to share best practices, and have an API explorer feature in our documentation, which allows developers to try out API calls with their own data before building a full deployment. We are seeing strong adoption of integrations on our platform, with our largest customers using on average six or more API integrations, up from four API integrations a year ago.
Sales and Marketing
We primarily sell subscriptions to our Connected Operations Cloud to large, medium-sized, and small businesses through a direct sales motion. Our enterprise sales team takes an account-based approach to target large multinational corporations, while our mid-market and commercial sales teams focus on medium-sized businesses and small businesses using both inbound and outbound sales techniques. Both teams are supported by a close partnership with our marketing team’s lead generation engine. For smaller projects, we have a self-service model driven by a seamless web store experience.
Our go-to-market and sales efforts are strengthened by our free-trial sales model. Prospective customers are invited to test our Connected Operations Cloud for their use case during a trial period at no cost. This drives significant trust in the solution and helps our highly technical sales team demonstrate the full capacity of our Connected Operations Cloud while simultaneously reducing post-sales friction.
We invest in a variety of marketing activities and programs to drive awareness, engage with prospective customers, and build a pipeline for our sales team. Our lead generation engine supports our growth targets by hosting and participating in field events, producing webinars, leveraging customer success case studies, press engagement, and more. To drive large customer growth, we leverage targeted, account-based marketing tactics.
In addition to our internal sales team, we also have a network of reseller partners who sell our products to customers. Further, we have established referral programs with some of our insurance and other partners, which act as an additional lead generation source.
Partners
We have built a robust ecosystem that includes over 220 integration partners in our Samsara App Marketplace, powered by an active developer community. In addition to these integration partners, we work with a network of system integrators, consultants, and implementation partners in our Experts Marketplace. We are seeing strong adoption by customers integrating into our system, with our largest customers using on average more than six API integrations. This enables developers to integrate our Connected Operations Cloud into a variety of use cases from payroll to TMS, fuel purchasing tools, navigation, and more. These APIs cover all of Samsara’s core Applications. We also have partnerships with OEMs who build connectivity into their products, such as vehicles and heavy equipment. These partnerships enable us to capture IoT data into our Connected Operations Cloud without requiring customers to install aftermarket IoT devices. This lowers the barrier to connecting data to our platform. Our partner ecosystem also encompasses a number of commercial partnerships. We work with a network of reseller partners and also have partnerships with insurance providers and select vendors in the third-party logistics (3PL) network. We have also partnered with insurance companies, who have become an important partner constituency whose end customers can leverage our Connected Operations Cloud in order to improve safety. As our relationships with these insurance partners have deepened, they have often incentivized their end customers to adopt our Connected Operations Cloud in exchange for reduced insurance premiums.
Research and Development
Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development, testing and delivery of new technologies, features, and integrations of our Applications, as well as the continued improvement and iteration of our Applications. It is also responsible for operating and scaling our Data Platform, including the underlying cloud infrastructure. Our most significant investments are in research and development to drive core technology innovation and to bring new Applications to market.
Competition
The connected physical operations industry is highly fragmented, with most vendors offering software and/or hardware solutions addressing specific industry verticals or specific solution sets. Our competition is specific to the individual solution sets that we target, or specific to operational groupings like fleets or facilities. We are not aware of other companies that approach the market with a common data cloud across connected fleets, equipment, and sites.
Video-Based Safety
Our fleet safety Applications primarily compete with vendors like Lytx and SmartDrive, who provide standalone camera and coaching tools.
Vehicle Telematics
Our telematics Applications primarily compete with vendors like Verizon Connect, Geotab, and Omnitracs, who provide a set of tools and reports focused on driver management, intermittent GPS tracking, asset tracking, and compliance.
Equipment Monitoring
Our equipment monitoring Applications compete with a wide range of vendors depending on the complexity of the equipment tracked. Our primary competitors for monitoring equipment and trailers are vendors focusing on equipment location tracking and diagnostics like Orbcomm and ZTR. For more advanced monitoring and control solutions, we primarily compete against homegrown internal or DIY solutions.
Site Visibility
Our site visibility Applications primarily compete with security, surveillance, and access control vendors like Avigilon (a Motorola Solutions company) that specialize in video analytics, AI, and network video management software.
The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we operate include:
•All-in-one software and hardware solution that addresses specific industry needs;
•Cloud-native applications whose feature set is effective, extensible, and evolving;
•Rapid development cycle based on customer feedback;
•High-quality, relevant, and actionable insights for operational managers and workers;
•Scalable data platform that can ingest and process data from various sources and apply powerful analytics across multiple data sets;
•Ease of adoption from installation to usability for back-office administrators and field workers;
•Reliability and security;
•Quality and responsiveness of customer support channels;
•Return on investment: Price for software, devices, installation and support relative to achieved cost savings;
•Brand awareness, reputation and trust in the provider’s services; and
•Strength of sales, marketing and channel partner relationships.
Based on these factors, we believe we are positioned favorably against our competitors. While many competitors focus on a subset of solutions for vehicles, such as GPS tracking and/or driver coaching, our Connected Operations Cloud provides an extensive view of relevant operational information across many physical operations assets. This real-time data enables intelligent recommendations that empower customers to achieve operational success while consolidating vendor costs and administration.
Our solution allows customers to use Samsara as their only physical operations management provider, instead of having to source, integrate and adopt point solutions across a variety of vendors. However, some of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources, greater brand recognition, larger sales forces and marketing budgets, as well as broader distribution networks. Large enterprises, in particular, may be able to utilize their distribution networks and existing relationships to offer fleet management solutions in addition to solutions in other verticals already being provided to customers. We expect additional competition as our market grows and rapidly changes, and we may choose to enter or expand into new markets as well.
Our Intellectual Property
Intellectual property rights are important to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and other contractual protections, to protect our intellectual property rights, including our proprietary technology, software, know-how and brand.
As of January 28, 2023, our portfolio consisted of 58 issued and eight allowed (issuance pending) patents in the United States. We also had 127 patent applications pending for examination in the United States and no non-U.S. patents or patent applications. Despite our pending U.S. patent applications, there can be no assurance that our patent applications will result in issued patents.
Although we rely on intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new services, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our platform are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.
We control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners. We generally require our employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and we control and monitor access to our software, documentation, proprietary technology and other confidential information. Our policy is to require all employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments, processes and other intellectual property generated by them on our behalf and under which they agree to protect our confidential information. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our customers and partners. See the section titled “Risk Factors” for a discussion of risks related to our intellectual property.
Government Regulation
We are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions and devote considerable resources to compliance with these laws and regulations.
For example, to the extent our products function as ELDs, we are subject to regulation by the FMCSA and foreign regulatory agencies. The FMCSA requires that ELD manufacturers register and self-certify that each ELD model and version they offer for sale has been sufficiently tested to meet certain functional requirements. Similarly, on January 1, 2023, Canada began enforcement of its ELD technical standard, mandating that motor carriers and drivers subject to HOS requirements in Canada use ELDs that have been tested and certified by an accredited, third-party certification body.
We also are subject to other laws and regulations governing issues such as privacy, data security, telecommunications, the use of biometric data, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, exports, anti-bribery, whistleblowing and worker confidentiality obligations, product liability, consumer protection and warnings, marketing, taxation, securities, competition, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions, and terms of service, among other issues. We could become subject to additional legal or regulatory requirements, including additional or modified requirements around ELD certification, if laws, regulations, or guidance change in the jurisdictions in which we operate. This could include the need to obtain new and different types of licenses or certifications to offer certain products or functionalities. Guiding our actions is a commitment to complying with, and helping our customers comply with, applicable regulations and requirements, and we will continue to devote significant internal resources to these efforts.
See the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Government Regulation” for additional information about the laws and regulations to which we are subject and the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations.
Data Protection and Privacy Program
We dedicate significant resources to protecting and securing the data of our customers as part of our overall data protection and privacy program.
In addition to the privacy and security measures that we incorporate into the design, engineering, and testing processes for our solution, we have company-wide policies that describe how we collect, use, protect and disclose data. We provide ongoing training to our employees to appropriately handle and secure data. We are also able to assist our customers in demonstrating their compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations through the use of template accountability documentation (e.g., data protection impact assessments, supporting policies, and data transfer impact assessments), which can be configured and tailored by customers to address their particular use cases and organizational requirements. We offer and include the latest EU Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) and supporting UK International Data Transfer Addendum in our contractual terms with customers for the purpose of helping enable our customers’ continued compliance with the changing regulatory landscape in connection with transferring personal data subject to the GDPR and UKDPA to third countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection to such personal data, including the United States, highlighting a commitment to protect personal information in accordance with a set of privacy principles that offer meaningful privacy protections and recourse for European-based individuals. We also include terms pursuant to the CCPA, as amended by the CPRA (together with its implementing regulations), in our contractual terms. We also maintain a self-certification under the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield programs. We hold our service providers and sub processors to the same high data protection and privacy standards to which we hold ourselves, including through contractual commitments and periodic reviews and audits.
See the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Government Regulation” for additional information about the laws and regulations to which we are subject and the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations.
