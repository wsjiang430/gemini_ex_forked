Item 1.  Business
 
Bel Fuse Inc. designs, manufactures and markets a broad array of products that power, protect and connect electronic circuits.  These products are primarily used in the networking, telecommunications, computing, general industrial, high-speed data transmission, military, commercial aerospace, transportation and eMobility industries.  Bel's portfolio of products also finds application in the automotive, medical, broadcasting and consumer electronics markets.  Bel's product groups include Magnetic Solutions (integrated connector modules, power transformers, power inductors and discrete components), Power Solutions and Protection (front-end, board-mount and industrial and transportation power products, module products and circuit protection), and Connectivity Solutions (expanded beam fiber optic, copper-based, RF and RJ connectors and cable assemblies).  
 
With more than 70 years in operation, Bel has reliably demonstrated the ability to participate in a variety of product areas across a global platform.  The Company has a strong track record of technical innovation working with the engineering teams of market leaders.  Bel has proven itself a valuable supplier to world-class companies by developing new products with cost effective solutions.
 
The Company was incorporated in 1949 and is organized under New Jersey law.  Bel's principal executive offices are located at 206 Van Vorst Street, Jersey City, New Jersey 07302, and Bel's telephone number is (201) 432-0463. The Company operates facilities in North America, Europe and Asia and trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (ticker symbols BELFA and BELFB).  For information regarding Bel's operating segments, see Note 13, "Segments", of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.  Hereinafter, all references to "Note" will refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Acquisitions have played a critical role in the growth of Bel and the expansion of both our product portfolio and our customer base and continue to be an important element in our growth strategy. We frequently evaluate possible acquisition candidates that would expand our product and technology offerings to our customers and/or optimize our overall cost structure. The Company may, from time to time, purchase equity positions in companies that are potential merger candidates.  In February 2023, Bel closed on an €8.0 million (approximately $8.8 million) noncontrolling investment in innolectric AG ("innolectric"), a Germany-based business in the field of on-board charging for eMobility applications. The innolectric investment will be part of Bel's Power Solutions and Protection group.
 
On March 31, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of EOS Power ("EOS") through a stock purchase agreement for $7.8 million, net of cash acquired, including a working capital adjustment.  EOS, located in Mumbai, India, had sales of $17.6 million and $15.4 million (pro forma) for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  EOS enhances Bel's position related to certain industrial and medical markets historically served by EOS, with a strong line of high-power density and low-profile products with high convection ratings. In addition to new products and customers acquired, this acquisition diversified Bel's manufacturing footprint in Asia.  The EOS business is part of Bel's Power Solutions and Protection group. 
 
On January 8, 2021, the Company acquired rms Connectors, Inc. (“rms Connectors” or "rms"), from rms Company Inc., a division of Cretex Companies, Inc., for $9.0 million in cash, including a working capital adjustment.  rms Connectors is a highly regarded connector manufacturer with over 30 years of experience producing harsh environment circular connectors used in a variety of military and aerospace applications. This acquisition complemented Bel's existing military and aerospace product portfolio and enabled us to expand key customer relationships within these end markets and leverage the combined manufacturing resources to improve our operational efficiency.  Originally based in Coon Rapids, Minnesota, the rms Connectors business was relocated into Bel's existing facilities during the second quarter of 2021, and is part of Bel's Connectivity Solutions group.  
 
On December 3, 2019, we completed the acquisition of the majority of the power supply products business of CUI Inc. (the "CUI power business") through an asset purchase agreement with CUI Global Inc. for $29.2 million (after a working capital adjustment), plus the assumption of certain liabilities.  The CUI power business designs and markets a broad portfolio of AC/DC and DC/DC power supplies and board level components.  The CUI power business is headquartered in Tualatin, Oregon and contributed sales of $64.5 million for 2022, $55.8 million for 2021 and $43.1 million for 2020.  The acquisition of the CUI power business enhanced Bel's existing offering of power products, allowing us to better address more of our customers' power needs.  It also introduced an alternative business model to Bel's, one which carries a higher gross margin profile and lower manufacturing risk.  CUI is part of Bel's Power Solutions and Protection group.

Products
 
The Company primarily generates revenue through the sale of its products.  Bel offers a broad array of product offerings, which are grouped as follows: Power Solutions & Protection (44% of net sales in 2022), Connectivity Solutions (29% of net sales in 2022) and Magnetic Solutions (27% of net sales in 2022).  While there are key customers and end markets within each of the three product groups, only one direct customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales in 2022 (this customer represented 12.8% of our consolidated net sales in 2022).  Our diverse product mix and customer base minimizes our dependence on any one customer or end market.

Sales and Marketing
 
We sell our products to customers throughout North America, Europe and Asia. Sales are made through one of three channels: direct strategic account managers, regional sales managers working with independent sales representative organizations or authorized distributors. Bel's strategic account managers are assigned to handle major accounts requiring global coordination.
 
Independent sales representatives and authorized distributors are overseen by the Company's sales management personnel located throughout the world. As of December 31, 2022, we had a sales and support staff of approximately 200 people that supported a network of sales representative organizations and non-exclusive distributors. We have written agreements with all our sales representative organizations and most of our major distributors. These written agreements, terminable on short notice by either party, are standard in the industry.
 
Sales support functions have also been established and located in our international facilities to provide timely, efficient support for customers. This supplemental level of service, in addition to first-line sales support, enables us to be more responsive to customers' needs on a global level. Our marketing capabilities include product management which drives new product development, application engineering for technical support and marketing communications.
 
Market Factors
 
Competition
 
We operate in a variety of markets, all of which are highly competitive. There are numerous independent companies and divisions of major companies that manufacture products that are competitive with one or more of our products.
 
Our ability to compete is dependent upon several factors including product performance, quality, reliability, depth of product line, customer service, technological innovation, design, delivery time and price. Overall financial stability and global presence also give us a favorable position in relation to some of our competitors.  Management intends to maintain a strong competitive posture in the markets we serve by continued expansion of our product lines and ongoing investment in research, development and manufacturing resources.  The preceding sentence represents a Forward-Looking Statement.  See "Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information."
 
Trends in Market Demand
 
Product orders, or bookings, received during 2022 amounted to $751.9 million, a 10% decrease from 2021.  By product group, orders received for our Power Solutions and Protection products amounted to $404.2 million in 2022, a 7% increase from 2021.  This increase was largely due to incremental orders of $38.5 million related to raw material expedite fees.  Orders received for our Connectivity Solutions products were $221.0 million in 2022, 10% higher than in 2021 as a result of increased demand from our distribution partners coupled with a rebound in demand from our direct and aftermarket commercial aerospace and military customers. Bookings for our Magnetic Solutions products decreased by 51% from 2021 to $126.8 million in 2022, largely due to reduced demand from our networking customers.
Backlog of Orders
 
We typically manufacture products against firm orders and projected usage by customers. Cancellation and return arrangements are either negotiated by us on a transactional basis or contractually determined.  We estimate the value of the backlog of orders as of February 28, 2023 to be approximately $526.9 million as compared with a backlog of $498.0 million as of February 28, 2022.  Management estimates that approximately 70%-75% of the Company's backlog as of February 28, 2023 will be shipped by December 31, 2023. Factors that could cause the Company to fail to ship all such orders by year-end include unanticipated supply difficulties, changes in customer demand and new customer designs.  Throughout 2022, Bel has faced macroeconomic and global supply chain challenges, and these conditions are expected to continue through at least the first half of 2023.  Due to these factors, backlog may not be a reliable indicator of the timing of future sales.  The preceding statements regarding the Company’s backlog, including but not limited to estimates and anticipated timing of shipping, represent Forward-Looking Statements.  See "Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information."

Research and Development ("R&D")
 
Our engineering groups are strategically located around the world to facilitate communication with and access to customers' engineering personnel. This collaborative approach enables partnerships with customers for technical development efforts. The global capabilities and collaborative approach allows Bel to develop leading edge technological products that support highly complex and evolving markets such as eMobility, cloud computing, military, aerospace, and others. On occasion, we execute non-disclosure agreements with customers to help develop proprietary, next generation products intended for rapid deployment.  We also sponsor membership in technical organizations that allow our engineers to participate in developing standards for emerging technologies. It is management's opinion that this participation is critical in establishing credibility and a reputable level of expertise in the marketplace, as well as positioning the Company as an industry leader in new product development.
 
R&D costs are expensed as incurred.  Generally, R&D is performed internally for the benefit of the Company.  R&D costs include salaries, building maintenance and utilities, rents, materials, administrative costs and miscellaneous other items.  
 
Resources
 
Raw Materials and Sourcing
 
We have multiple suppliers for most of the raw materials that we purchase.  Where possible, we have contractual agreements with suppliers to assure a continuing supply of critical components.
 
With respect to those items which are purchased from single sources, we believe that comparable items would be available in the event that there was a termination of our existing business relationships with any such supplier.  While such a termination could produce a disruption in production, we believe that the termination of business with any one of our suppliers would not have a material adverse effect on our long-term operations. Actual experience could differ materially from this belief as a result of a number of factors, including the time required to locate an alternative supplier, and the nature of the demand for our products.  In the past, we have experienced shortages in certain raw materials, such as capacitors, ferrites and integrated circuits ("IC's"), when these materials were in great demand.  Even though we may have more than one supplier for certain materials, it is possible that these materials may not be available to us in sufficient quantities or at the times desired by us.  In the event that the current economic conditions have a negative impact on the financial condition of our suppliers, this may impact the availability and cost of our raw materials.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We have acquired or been granted a number of patents in the U.S., Europe and Asia and have additional patent applications pending relating to our products. While we believe that the issued patents are defendable and that the pending patent applications relate to patentable inventions, there can be no assurance that a patent will be obtained from the applications or that our existing patents can be successfully defended.  It is management's opinion that the successful continuation and operation of our business does not depend upon the ownership of patents or the granting of pending patent applications, but upon the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing and managerial abilities of our personnel.  Our U.S. design patents have a life of 14 years and our U.S. utility patents have a life of 17 years from the date of issue or 20 years from filing of patent applications.  Our existing patents expire on various dates through July 2041.
 
We utilize registered trademarks in the U.S., Europe and Asia to identify various products that we manufacture.  The trademarks survive as long as they are in use and the registrations of these trademarks are renewed.
 
Government Contracts
 
We must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. A violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks, or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation. It could also result in our progress payments being withheld.
 
    6 

  

In some instances, these laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are more favorable to the government than those typically available to commercial parties in negotiated transactions. For example, the U.S. Government may terminate any of our government contracts and, in general, subcontracts, at its convenience as well as for default based on performance. Upon termination for convenience of a fixed-price type contract, we normally are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement for allowable costs for work-in-process, and an allowance for profit on work actually completed on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in a loss. Upon termination for convenience of a Federal Government cost reimbursement contract, we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable costs plus a portion of the fee. Such allowable costs would normally include our cost to terminate agreements with our suppliers and subcontractors. The amount of the fee recovered, if any, is related to the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation.
 
Seasonality
 
In the People's Republic of China ("PRC"), the availability of labor is cyclical and is significantly affected by the migration of workers in relation to the annual Lunar New Year holiday.  Each year following the Lunar New Year holiday, we must assess the worker return rate and whether it is adequate to meet the needs of current demand from our customers.  Accordingly, we must continually recruit and train new workers to replace those lost to attrition each year and to address peaks in demand that may occur from time to time.  This temporary setback in production has historically resulted in our first quarter sales being the lowest sales quarter of the year.  Further, recruiting and training efforts and related inefficiencies, as well as overtime required in order to meet demand, can add volatility to the costs incurred by the Company for labor in the PRC, primarily during the first quarter of the year.
Government Regulations
 
The Company is subject to various government regulations in the United States as well as various jurisdictions where it operates. These regulations cover several diverse areas including trade compliance, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, money laundering, and data and privacy protection. Regulatory or government authorities where the Company operates may have enforcement powers that can subject the company to legal penalties or other measures and can impose changes or conditions in the way it conducts business.
Human Capital Resources, Strategy and Management
 
At Bel, our values guide everything we do. We are committed to the highest standards of ethical and legal conduct and have created an environment where open and honest communication is the expectation, not the exception. Failing to do so puts Bel’s name, reputation for integrity and business at risk.  We hold all employees of Bel (our associates) to this standard and offer the same in return. Our Code of Ethics was created to ensure that our associates, officers, directors, partners, contractors, and suppliers follow our commitment to customer satisfaction in accordance with ethical and legal standards, guided by the basic, unchanging principle of integrity.
 
Our Human Capital Strategy is built around four areas:
 
Extraordinary Performance
 
Our associates are a critical driver of Bel’s global business results. On December 31, 2022, Bel employed approximately 7,000 associates, almost all of which are full-time, across 15 countries, with 29 percent located within North America. Outside of the United States, our largest employee populations were located within the PRC, Mexico, Slovakia, the Dominican Republic, India and the United Kingdom. We regularly monitor various key performance indicators around the key human capital priorities of attracting, retaining, and engaging our global talent. In addition, we enable the execution of our strategic priorities by providing all associates with access to training and development opportunities to improve critical skill sets.

Great Associates
 
Bel is committed to fostering an inclusive environment that respects and encourages individual differences, diversity of thought, and talent. We strive to create a workplace where associates feel that their contributions are welcomed and valued, allowing them to fully utilize their talents while achieving personal satisfaction in their respective roles within Bel. 
 
Across the organization, we invest in our people to learn in a variety of ways - on the job, in the classroom, through self-directed learning, and through leadership programs. We have expanded our learning management system to make new content and training available to our associates. The Company has advanced its leadership development programs and continues to enhance internship and apprenticeship programs to develop new talent. 
 
Health and Safety
 
Bel offers a variety of programs globally to protect the health and safety of our associates. While we maintain targets for year-over-year reduction of the total recordable incident rate and serious injuries, our goal is always zero.
 
In 2022, our focus continued to be on the immediate demands within the context of COVID-19 challenges. Where possible, our associates continue to work remotely and in the office on a hybrid schedule. There are additional safeguards in our plants consistent with the guidelines provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health organizations around the world.  In addition, the Company continues to implement a variety of programs globally to protect the physical and mental health and safety of our associates through awareness training and wellness programs.  See "The Effects of COVID-19 on Bel’s Business" in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of how COVID-19 is currently impacting our business.
 
Culture
 
In an increasingly competitive global marketplace, Bel succeeds when we attract and retain the best talent that is reflective of the diversity of the communities in which we work and live.
 
We are committed to increasing the diversity of our workforce by participating in networking and community events and actively recruiting and hiring veterans, women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities.
 
As a global leader in delivering reliable solutions, Bel has signed a Statement of Support Program declaration to show support for National Guard and Reserve member associates coordinated by the Department of Defense's Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR) program. The intent of the program is to increase employer support by encouraging employers to act as advocates for associate participation in the military.
 
The global Human Resources team members are strategically placed, primarily in manufacturing facilities, to provide support to all our associates. The mission of Human Resources is to attract, retain and engage the best people. We create a positive work environment where associates can make a difference.
 
As a company that has been in business for over 70 years, Bel understands the importance of trust, integrity and accountability at all levels of the organization.  Our policies, practices and priorities are continually reviewed to align with the best interests of our associates, shareholders and other stakeholders. 
 
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)
 
Bel is committed to creating a better tomorrow by understanding how our actions impact the world around us. We aim to accomplish this by making tangible steps, big and small, to invest in our communities, to seek to minimize environmental impact and to promote alignment of interest among stakeholders. As an organization that thrives on learning and continuous improvement, Bel welcomes and embraces change. The below sections outline some recent developments at Bel as we work to drive continuous improvements in these areas.

Global Director of ESG
 
In November 2022 Bel appointed a Global Director of ESG. This new dedicated role will allow the Company to embark on a series of initiatives aimed at improving Bel’s commitment to its ESG program.
 
ESG Committee
 
The first internal (operations-level) ESG Committee was formed in early December of 2022. The purpose of the ESG Committee is to support the Company’s ongoing commitment to ESG matters including environmental stewardship, health and safety, corporate social responsibility, corporate governance, sustainability, and other related issues of significance to the Company.
 
The ESG Committee aims to:
 

● | Define ESG priorities, objectives and strategy with the goal of further integrating sustainability into the Company’s strategy and operations, subject to the oversight and overall direction of the Nominating and ESG Committee of our Board of Directors (as described below);

The members of the ESG Committee include senior executives and associates from various regions and business segments while taking into account each person’s expertise in relevant disciplines, such as environmental, health and safety, operations, marketing, legal, investor relations, corporate governance, finance, and human resources.
 
Board-Level Oversight of ESG Matters
 
In October 2022, Bel’s Board of Directors approved an expanded role for its Nominating Committee, broadening the purposes and functions of such committee to include oversight and monitoring of ESG matters, and re-designating the committee as the “Nominating and ESG Committee” in recognition of these new responsibilities. In accordance with the amended charter of the Nominating and ESG Committee, a copy of which can be found at https://ir.belfuse.com/corporate-governance, certain oversight functions were added including:
 

● | To oversee the Company’s corporate governance initiatives and periodically consider, and report to the Board on, such initiatives and applicable policies, including development and periodic review of corporate governance guidelines for the Company; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | To assist the Board in overseeing and monitoring the Company’s environmental, social and corporate governance policies, activities, practices and initiatives, including matters relating to sustainability, environmental stewardship, corporate social responsibility including ethical business practices, corporate culture and health and safety programs, and other public issues of significance which affect investors and other key stakeholders including such other matters that may be referred to the Committee by the Board from time to time.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Bel’s internal ESG Committee provides updates to either the Nominating and ESG Committee or to the full Board on a quarterly basis.

Environmental
 
At Bel, we understand the impact of climate change upon so many aspects of our lives and our future, and we are committed to reducing environmental impact for a more sustainable tomorrow. We consistently look for alternatives and approaches to consider in Bel’s business and strategies at multiple levels, from improving the efficiency ratings of our products and factories to better managing our consumption habits of electricity and water.
 
Bel is currently in the process of reviewing and assessing its practices to ensure consistency and alignment across its major manufacturing sites globally. During the fourth quarter of 2022, Bel launched a Company-wide effort to assess our current position in terms of environmental impact, greenhouse gas emissions and associate health and safety. We expect these results will provide a roadmap for driving and standardizing future initiatives.
 
Today we have 22 manufacturing facilities of various sizes and five of them are ISO 14001 certified and represent 61% of our manufacturing footprint. These five sites have been measuring their consumption levels of natural gas, electricity and water and have targets in place for reducing consumption and waste and improving recycling efforts. For the rest of our manufacturing sites, we intend to follow an approach comparable to the template laid out with these five as we begin the process of better understanding our impact.
 
Social 
 
Associates are the cornerstone of our business and key to our success. At Bel, we believe in the need for diversity and inclusion that reflects the communities in which we work and live. Associates are encouraged to bring with them their unique perspectives, opinions and experiences as they work for the betterment of Bel, its customers and the locations in which we operate. Bel recognizes its role in the global community and giving back is a priority. From coaching their local sports team to raising funds for local charities of choice, Bel supports and encourages our associates’ participation in these types of activities.
2022 Charitable Contribution Program:
 
In 2022, Bel launched a Company-wide Charitable Contribution Program to ensure consistency and drive our corporate values across the organization. The social program is in alignment with our Core Value of Community Engagement and directly reflects the ambitions of our ESG initiative to support the global communities within which we operate. The fundraising took place across 15 countries resulting in donations to 68 local charities. In addition, there was a matching program for the organizations selected and associates who donated.
Governance 
 
As a company that has been in business for over 70 years, Bel understands the importance of trust, integrity and accountability at all levels of the organization. Recent additions to our Board and executive management team have brought greater diversity and new perspectives to Bel. We intend that our policies, practices and priorities will be periodically and continually reviewed as appropriate to better align with the best interests of our shareholders, associates and other stakeholders.
 
In addition to the establishment of Board-level ESG oversight pursuant to the Nominating and ESG Committee’s expanded role and the creation of Bel’s internal ESG Committee as discussed above, in February 2023, the Board adopted Bel’s Corporate Governance Guidelines which are available at https://ir.belfuse.com/corporate-governance. These guidelines, which are designed to enhance the Company’s corporate governance, will serve as a framework withing which the Board will conduct its business, subject to applicable laws, regulations, listing requirements, and the Company’s organizational documents and Board committee charters. 
 
Bel is committed to a better tomorrow. With a solid foundation and oversight functions having been established, we expect ESG to be an ongoing journey of continuous improvement.
