ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview 



We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company dedicated to enabling cures through therapeutics targeting mast and hemopoietic stem cells. We are focused on the development and commercialization of safer and more effective therapeutic agents for diseases such as Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (“CSU”), Lower to Intermediate Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (“LR-MDS”) and novel conditioning regimens for stem cell transplantation and ex-vivo gene therapy, a technique in which genetic manipulation of cells is performed outside of the body prior to transplantation.



Our drug development pipeline includes multiple product candidates designed to target mast and/or hematopoietic stem cells. Our lead product candidate, briquilimab (formerly known as JSP191), is in clinical development as a novel therapeutic antibody that targets mast and stem cells in various diseases and as a conditioning agent to clear hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow in patients prior to undergoing allogeneic stem cell therapy or stem cell gene therapy. We are also developing engineered hematopoietic stem cells product candidates reprogrammed using mRNA delivery (“mRNA stem cell platform”) and gene editing that have a competitive advantage over endogenous hematopoietic stem cells (“HSCs”) because they may permit higher levels of engraftment without the need for toxic conditioning. We also plan to continue to expand our pipeline to include other novel mast and stem cell therapies based on immune modulation, graft engineering or cell and gene therapies. Our goal is to expand the use of therapeutic agents targeting mast and stem cells as well as to expand curative stem cell transplants and gene therapies for all patients, including children and the elderly.



Mast cells are immune cells that play a key role in the inflammatory response to pathogens or injury and are typically found in the skin, lungs, digestive track, conjunctiva of the eye and the mucosal linings of the mouth and nose. Typically, mast cells are triggered by a specific antigen or antibody interaction to release histamine, a variety of cytokines and other chemical mediators in order fight a potential infection and to recruit additional types of immune cells to aid in the body’s response. However, with certain diseases, such as CSU, chronic inducible urticaria, allergic asthma, prurigo nodularis and eosinophilic esophagitis, the mast cell response is dysregulated and may lead to unwanted responses such as hives, airway constriction or conjunctivitis. Current therapeutic approaches to controlling mast cell response include anti-histamines to counteract the release of histamine by activated mast cells and anti-IgE antibody therapy to try to eliminate the antibodies responsible for triggering mast cell activation. We believe that new chronic therapies that target mast cells could be beneficial in treating many diseases that are a function of mast cell dysfunction.



Myelodysplastic syndromes (“MDS”) are a mixed group of hematological disorders characterized by decreased production of healthy blood and/or immune cells by the hematologic stem cells and eventual progression to Acute Myeloid Leukemia (“AML”). Patients with LR-MDS are typically treated with blood transfusions to augment poor bone marrow stem cell function or with growth factors, such as erythropoietin, to stimulate any remaining healthy bone marrow cells to increase production of blood or immune cells. The goals of current treatments are to delay the progression of the disease to AML and for an eventual donor stem cell transplant for eligible patients. We believe that novel approaches that directly target the diseased stem cells in the bone marrow of MDS patients may lead to better clinical outcomes such as decreased need for blood transfusions, decreased use of growth factors, and delayed disease progression.



Stem cell transplantation is among the most widely practiced forms of cellular therapy and has the potential to cure a wide variety of diseases, including cancers, genetic disorders and autoimmune diseases. A stem cell transplant procedure involves three main steps: (i) stem cells from the patient’s or donor’s bone marrow are collected; (ii) the patient’s bone marrow is cleared of any remaining stem cells in order to make space to receive new transplanted stem cells, which is known as conditioning; and (iii) the new stem cells are transplanted into the patient via infusion where they fasten to, or engraft in, the bone marrow and grow into the blood and immune cells that form the basis of reset and rebuilt blood and immune systems. Transplants are either allogeneic or autologous, depending on the source of the new stem cells for the transplant. In an allogeneic transplant, patients receive cells from a stem cell donor. In an autologous transplant, the patient’s own stem cells are used. Autologous transplants also include stem cell gene therapies, where cells are collected from the patient, edited to either enable a functioning gene or correct a defective gene, and then transplanted into the patient via infusion.



Currently, patients must receive highly toxic and potentially life-threatening conditioning agents to prepare their bone marrow for transplantation with either donor stem cells or their own gene-edited stem cells. Younger, fitter patients capable of surviving these toxic side effects are typically given myeloablative, or high-intensity, conditioning whereas older or less fit patients are typically given reduced intensity, but still toxic, conditioning which leads to less effective transplants. These toxicities include a range of acute and chronic effects to the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, liver, lung, endocrine and neurologic tissues. Depending upon the conditioning regimen, fitness of the patient, and compatibility between the donor and recipient, the risk of transplant-related mortality ranges from 10% to more than 50% in older patients. Less toxic ways to condition patients have been developed to enable transplant for older patients or those with major comorbidities, but these regimens risk less potent disease elimination and higher rates of disease relapse. Even though stem cell therapy can be one of the most powerful forms of disease cure, these limitations of non-targeted conditioning regimens have seen little innovation over the past decade. We believe that novel targeting approaches to stem cell conditioning have the potential to reduce toxicities associated with current regimens and expand the use of allogeneic and gene modified transplant in multiple diseases.

Our lead product candidate, briquilimab, is a monoclonal antibody designed to block stem cell factor (“SCF”) from binding to and signaling through the CD117 receptor on mast and stem cells. The SCF/CD117 pathway is a survival signal for mast and stem cells and we believe that blocking this pathway may lead to depletion of these cells from skin and bone marrow environments. Currently, we are developing briquilimab as chronic therapy for CSU and LR-MDS. We are also developing briquilimab as a one-time conditioning therapy in various stem cell transplant settings such as severe combined immunodeficiency (“SCID”) for which we are currently conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients who have failed a previous stem cell transplant. Briquilimab is also being studied by our academic and institutional partners, Stanford University and National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), in other transplant settings, including Fanconi Anemia (“FA”), sickle cell disease (“SCD”), chronic granulomatous disease (“CGD”) and GATA-2 Type MDS.



We are planning to evaluate briquilimab as a therapeutic in patients with CSU, a disorder of mast cells in the skin. Patients with CSU experience swelling, redness and itching of the skin that lasts at least six weeks due to either an unknown cause, Type I autoimmunity with Immunoglobulin E antibodies (“IgE”) against self or Type IIb autoimmunity with activating antibodies directed at mast cells. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”)-approved drug therapy for CSU includes second generation H1-antihistamines for first line use followed by consideration for use of omalizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed at circulating IgE. The biologic rationale for both of these therapies is based on modulating mast cell response. Antihistamines work to counteract the effects of histamine that is released from activated mast cells and omalizumab is designed to reduce IgE, which are thought to trigger mast cell activation. Based on preclinical and human healthy volunteer clinical data showing that briquilimab can deplete mast cells from the skin, we believe that briquilimab could be effective therapy for CSU patients. We intend to study briquilimab monotherapy in CSU patients who are refractory to anti-histamine therapy.



We also plan to evaluate briquilimab as a therapeutic for certain patients with proliferative disorders of hematopoietic stem cells. MDS is a heterogeneous disorder of the bone marrow that typically occurs in an older population and can progress to AML. The Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (“IPSS-R”) is a clinical assessment tool used to evaluate risk and prognosis of newly diagnosed patients. Patients with IPSS-R scores of low or very low are not typically referred for a stem cell transplant due to the risk of transplant-related toxicities from current conditioning regiments, infection and Graft vs Host Disease (“GvHD”) outweighing the patient’s expected survival with drug therapies. These patients typically suffer from anemia, thrombocytopenia or neutropenia and are given drug therapies such as an erythropoiesis stimulating agent (“ESA”) to stimulate production of new cells to correct their blood deficiency. However, these agents do not target the diseased hematopoietic stem cell and patients who become refractory to ESA are dependent on routine blood transfusions, which are associated with poor survival rates. ESA-refractory lower-risk MDS patients have few treatment options and are a clinical unmet need.



Briquilimab and other anti-CD117 monoclonal antibodies have been shown to deplete normal and diseased MDS human hematopoietic stem cells in clinical and pre-clinical studies. In studies of non-human primates (“NHPs”) and healthy human volunteers, administration of a single dose of briquilimab resulted in depletion of healthy hematopoietic stem cells followed by recovery in approximately six weeks. Additional recent clinical data in MDS patients undergoing stem cell transplants showed depletion of hematopoietic stem cells after administration of briquilimab alone. By depleting diseased and healthy hematopoietic stem cells, we believe that briquilimab may allow for preferential recovery of healthy hematopoietic stem cells and restoration of normal hematopoiesis. We intend to study briquilimab monotherapy in lower-risk MDS patients with documented cytopenia who are refractory to ESA therapy.



We are also developing briquilimab for SCID. Due to genetic errors at birth, SCID patients do not possess fully functional immune systems, which results in chronic infections, failure to thrive and significantly decreased lifespans. If available, these patients are typically given a transplant from a close relative with the goal of allowing healthy donor stem cells to establish in the patient’s bone marrow, leading to production of normal immune cells. However, stem cell transplants are not universally successful. SCID patients with poor transplant outcomes are typically dependent on external therapies such as intravenous immunoglobin (“IVIG”) and often have poor immunity, leading to chronic infections and decreased lifespans. SCID patients who fail transplant are not usually given a second transplant due to their fragile health and the significant toxicities of current conditioning agents.

We are currently conducting an open label Phase 1/2 clinical trial in SCID patients with a history of a prior allogeneic transplant for SCID but with poor graft outcomes. The primary goals of the study are to evaluate the safety of briquilimab in this population and to assess successful donor transplantation leading to improved immune function. Based on preliminary results from the ongoing trial, we believe briquilimab has demonstrated the ability to enable engraftment of donor HSCs as a single agent as determined by donor chimerism, or the percentage of bone marrow cells in the patient that are of donor origin after transplant. Seven out of the first ten T cell-negative, B cell-negative (“T-B-”) SCID patients with prior allogeneic transplant achieved donor engraftment, naïve donor T cell production and demonstrated preliminary clinical improvement after re-transplantation using briquilimab-only conditioning. No briquilimab treatment-related serious adverse events (“SAEs”) have been reported to date and pharmacokinetics have been consistent with earlier studies in healthy volunteers. We expect to complete enrollment in this Phase 1/2 clinical trial in 2023.



The FDA has granted rare pediatric disease designation to briquilimab as a conditioning treatment for patients with SCID. In addition, both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) have granted orphan drug designation to briquilimab for conditioning treatment prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.



We also are evaluating briquilimab in an open label Phase 1 clinical trial of donor stem cell transplant in patients with MDS or AML. The primary endpoints are to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic parameters of briquilimab. In this clinical trial, 0.6 mg/kg briquilimab-based conditioning was well tolerated in all 31 MDS/AML patients as of December 31, 2022. Furthermore, it led to successful engraftment as demonstrated by sustained blood neutrophil count of >500 x 10^6 / L (Wolff 2002) in all 31 patients. Additionally, at one year post-transplant, eight of the twelve AML patients on study were alive and disease-free, without trace evidence of leukemic cells, or minimal residual disease (“MRD”) as detected by cytogenetics, flow cytometry or next-generation sequencing, a secondary endpoint of the clinical study. No briquilimab-related SAEs have been reported. Among the twelve AML patients, three patients had disease relapse and one patient came off study due to late onset Grade 3 acute GvHD. We expect to present additional data from this study, including data from the MDS patients, in 2023.



We have entered into a clinical collaboration with Stanford University (“Stanford”) to study briquilimab-based conditioning in patients with FA with bone marrow failure and who are eligible for stem cell transplant. This study is currently open for patient recruitment. The first two patients enrolled in this study have been transplanted and show 100% donor myeloid chimerism, a measurement of transplant efficacy, along with recovery of normal blood counts. We are also collaborating with the NIH to conduct clinical trials of briquilimab-based conditioning in patients with SCD, with CGD and with GATA-2 mutated MDS. The first three patients in the SCD study have shown full myeloid chimerism and increased production of hemoglobin compared to their pre-transplant baseline. We believe that briquilimab may also be useful for conditioning in allogenic transplant for other diseases beyond which we are currently studying, including autoimmune diseases. We also believe that targeted briquilimab-based conditioning may improve the efficacy and safety of gene therapies.



Our mRNA stem cell platform is designed to overcome key limitations of stem cell transplant and stem cell gene therapy. By using mRNA delivery and/or gene editing, we believe we can reprogram donor or gene corrected stem cells to have a transient proliferative and survival advantage over the patient’s existing cells. We believe our initial preclinical experiments demonstrate that multiple different mRNAs can be used to improve engraftment of modified stem cells. One example is mRNA stem cell grafts that express certain variants of CXCR4, a cell surface protein involved in cellular homing to the bone marrow, which may lead to improved stem cell homing and engraftment in the bone marrow. Another example includes expression of a modified stem cell factor receptor that can lead to cell line proliferation independent of SCF concentration, enabling our mRNA stem cell grafts to outcompete unmodified HSCs through better survival and engraftment. Also, since briquilimab only blocks signaling through the SCF receptor, these mRNA stem cell grafts are not affected by briquilimab when used in combination. Other initial experiments have shown that mRNA can be used to express these receptor variants on the cell surface. We have also identified other potential receptor modifications that prevent the binding of briquilimab but retain the ability to bind SCF, therefore allowing the mRNA stem cell grafts to proliferate normally even in the presence of briquilimab.



We intend to become a fully integrated discovery, development and commercial company in the field of mast and stem cell therapeutics. We are developing our product candidates to be used individually or, in some cases, in combination with one another. For example, we believe our pipeline could be tailored to the patient-specific disease so that a patient may receive more than one of our therapies as part of his or her individual allogeneic or gene-edited stem cell therapy. Our goal is to advance our product candidates through regulatory approval and bring them to the commercial market based on the data from our clinical trials and communications with regulatory agencies and payor communities. We expect to continue to advance our pipeline and innovate through our research platform.



We have an exclusive license agreement with Amgen Inc. (“Amgen”) for the development and commercialization of the briquilimab monoclonal antibody in all indications and territories worldwide. We also have an exclusive license agreement with Stanford for the right to use briquilimab in the clearance of stem cells prior to the transplantation of HSCs. We also entirely own the intellectual property for our mRNA stem cell platform, which has been internally developed.



Our Product Pipeline



We are developing a portfolio of novel product candidates that we believe have the potential to meaningfully improve chronic mast and stem cell therapy for patients with certain blood disorders and autoimmune diseases. Additionally, we believe our product candidates have the potential to allow more patients with debilitating or life-threatening diseases to access a one-time, transformative blood and immune reset through transplant with better outcomes and reduced risk of toxicity and mortality versus current technologies. We are developing our product candidates so that they can be used individually or in combination with one another, such that patients may receive more than one of our therapies as part of their individual transplant journey. In addition to our first set of clinical product candidates, we are in the process of identifying several other potential candidates from our mRNA-modified hematopoietic stem cell platform.

Briquilimab



We believe briquilimab is a unique, humanized, monoclonal antibody that targets the underlying biology of mast cell and stem cell survival pathways to potentially improve the efficacy and safety of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Briquilimab is in development as a chronic therapy in CSU and LR-MDS, as well as a conditioning agent to clear hematopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow prior to transplant. Briquilimab binds to human CD117, a receptor for SCF, which is expressed on the surface of mast cells and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. The interaction of SCF and CD117 is required for mast and stem cells to survive. By blocking SCF from binding to CD117 and disrupting critical survival signals, briquilimab leads to the depletion of mast cells in the skin and stem cells in the bone marrow. Briquilimab is in development as a conditioning agent, both as a single agent and in combination with existing agents depending on the need in a particular transplant setting.



Briquilimab as a Primary Therapeutic for Disorders of Mast Cells



Mast cells are primary cells of the immune system derived from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. Mast cells store a number of different chemical mediators such as tryptase, histamine, interleukins and heparin in granules found throughout the cell. When triggered by an allergen specific to membrane-bound IgE antibodies, the mast cells are activated and release the content of the granules into the surrounding tissue. These chemical mediators attract other immune cells to help with any response as well as produce a local allergic reaction consisting of inflammation, swelling, contraction of smooth muscle and increased mucus secretion. Mast cells are usually long-lived and found at boundaries to the external environment such as the skin, mucosal surfaces of the gut and lungs and eye.



Dysfunctional regulation and activation of mast cells is thought to be a significant driver of multiple diseases, including urticarias, asthma, prurigo nodularis, allergic eye disease and others. Each of these diseases has been shown to have local concentrations of mast cells, cellular response consistent with mast cell degranulation and disease modification with use of anti-histamines. Unfortunately, currently approved agents targeting mast cells in these diseases are ineffective in many patients, leading to continued high disease burden.



Briquilimab blocks signaling on the CD117 receptor by inhibiting the binding of SCF, the ligand for the CD117 receptor. The interaction of SCF/CD117 on mast cells is critical for development, proliferation and survival. Without continued signaling through CD117, mast cells will undergo apoptosis and die. We have shown that a subcutaneous dosing of briquilimab leads to depletion of mast cells in the skin of healthy human volunteers for at least 29 days after a single administration. We believe that depletion of mast cells in the skin of patients with urticaria or prurigo nodularis and in the lungs of patients with allergic asthma has the potential to lead to improved disease control for those patients without adequate response to current therapies.







We intend to study briquilimab monotherapy in patients with CSU who are refractory to second generation anti-histamine agents. We plan to file an investigational new drug (“IND”) application with the FDA in the second quarter of 2023 with a potential study start in the third quarter of 2023.



Briquilimab as a Primary Therapeutic for Proliferative Disorders of the Stem Cells



A transforming event in hematopoietic stem cells can produce several different malignancies. Cancer stem cells can self-renew, have a prolonged survival rate and have the ability to give rise to cells with more differentiated characteristics. The idea that cancer is primarily driven by a smaller population of stem cells has important implications. For instance, many chemotherapies can shrink tumors or deplete downstream differentiated cells, but if the chemotherapies do not kill the cancer stem cells, the tumor will grow back.



It has been shown that HSCs are the disease-initiating cells in cancers like MDS and that these pathogenic MDS HSCs outcompete normal HSCs present in the bone marrow of affected patients. Furthermore, these disease-initiating HSCs express CD117 and anti-CD117 antibodies can target and eradicate these pathogenic cells. This is especially significant in a disease like MDS where available therapies either lack disease-modifying activity or possess off-target toxicity, which prevents their use in older and/or fragile individuals who comprise most of the patients affected by MDS. Development of anti-CD117 monoclonal antibodies, which might be safely used to target MDS clones, would represent a major step forward for the treatment of this disease.

We plan to evaluate briquilimab as a therapeutic for certain MDS patients. The IPSS-R is a clinical assessment tool used to evaluate risk and prognosis of newly diagnosed patients. Patients with IPSS-R scores of low or very low are not typically referred to stem cell transplant due to the risk of transplant-related toxicities from current conditioning regiments, infection and GvHD outweighing the patient’s expected survival with drug therapies. These patients typically suffer from anemia, thrombocytopenia or neutropenia and are given drug therapies such as an ESA to stimulate production of new cells to correct their blood deficiency. However, these agents do not target the diseased hematopoietic stem cell and patients who become refractory to ESA are dependent on routine blood transfusions, which are associated with poor survival rates. ESA refractory lower-risk MDS patients have few treatment options and are a clinical unmet need.



Briquilimab and other anti-CD117 monoclonal antibodies have been shown to deplete normal and diseased MDS human hematopoietic stem cells in clinical and pre-clinical studies. In studies in NHPs and healthy human volunteers, administration of a single dose of briquilimab resulted in depletion of healthy hematopoietic stem cells followed by recovery in approximately six weeks. Dr. Wendy Pang demonstrated at Stanford that briquilimab is capable of depleting MDS HSCs in vivo in a xenografted mouse model. New data from our MDS/AML trial of briquilimab as a conditioning agent have revealed that the antibody can have a direct depletion effect on CD34+CD45RA-CD117+ cells prior to administration of fludarabine or radiation. By depleting diseased and healthy hematopoietic stem cells, we believe that briquilimab may allow for preferential recovery of healthy hematopoietic stem cells and restoration of normal hematopoiesis.



We intend to study briquilimab monotherapy in lower-risk MDS patients with documented cytopenia who are refractory to ESA therapy. We plan to run the primary treatment study under the existing new drug application for MDS/AML and anticipate enrollment to begin in this single arm clinical trial in the first half of 2023. 



mRNA Stem Cell Platform



Our mRNA stem cell grafts are designed to overcome key limitations of allogeneic donor and autologous gene-edited stem cell transplants. By delivering mRNA or modifying DNA, leading to expression of a modified receptor or protein, we can reprogram donor or gene-edited stem cells to have a transient proliferative and survival advantage over the patient’s existing cells to permit higher levels of engraftment without the need for toxic conditioning of the patient. mRNA stem cell grafts have the potential to eliminate the need for donor T-cells, B-cells and NK-cells which are needed in unmodified donor HSC grafts to permit robust engraftment but can lead to GvHD, where the donor cells attack the patient’s tissues, resulting in the need for long-term immunosuppression therapies.
Our Strategy



Our goal is to bring curative allogeneic and autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (“HCT”) and gene therapy to more people by developing compounds that can make it safer and more effective. As part of our strategy, we aim to:



Build a leading biotechnology company to enable cures via immune modulation, graft engineering and cell and gene therapies. We are bringing together a team of biotech veterans, leading academic institutions and a strong syndicate of healthcare-focused investors to achieve our vision of developing improved therapeutics for mast and stem cell diseases and improved stem cell transplantation.



Advance the development of briquilimab as a chronic therapeutic targeted at mast and stem cell diseases. We are targeting disorders of mast and stem cells, including CSU and LR-MDS, with briquilimab as a repeat dose therapy. We believe that briquilimab may also be effective in other diseases of the mast or stem cell and we may consider expanding our efforts in additional indications.



Continue to develop briquilimab as a novel, targeted pre-transplant conditioning agent enabling more efficacious and safer HCT. Starting with our lead product candidate, briquilimab, we are advancing the field of HCT to address effective and safe pre-transplant conditioning in hematologic monogenic and malignant disorders as well as in autoimmune disease and gene therapy. Our initial focus is on SCID, AML, MDS and autologous gene-edited stem cell transplants.



Advance our mRNA platform to overcome the limitations of current allogeneic and autologous gene-edited stem cell transplants. We are developing enhanced stem cell therapies with transient proliferative advantages, which we believe may translate to superior efficacy and reduced GvHD compared to current standard of care therapies in allogenic and autologous gene therapy transplants.



Commercialize our product candidates to expand the use of effective and safe mast and stem cell therapies for patients and physicians in our target markets. If approved, we plan to bring our product candidates to the American, European and Japanese markets, focusing on the top physicians and accredited transplant centers and hospital-based prescribers who administer the majority of mast and stem cell therapies.



Form and strengthen strategic collaborations with leading industry and academic organizations to further develop our pipeline, unlock the commercial potential of our portfolio and provide enabling technologies for gene therapy collaborators. We intend to continue collaborations with our existing partners and enter new strategic partnerships to develop additional candidates, generate evidence, and commercialize new products in the field of mast and stem cell therapies.

Background on Hematopoietic Stem Cell Therapy



HCT is among the most widely practiced forms of cellular therapy and has the potential to cure a wide variety of diseases. Currently, its use is limited to patients with severe disease burden due to the toxicities of current non-targeted conditioning regimens and the limitations of the transplant grafts themselves.



Stem cell transplants first require identification of a suitable donor and collection of the donor’s stem cells, typically from blood. Then chemotherapy or radiation-based conditioning is used to clear the patient’s bone marrow of existing diseased stem cells in order to make space to receive new transplanted stem cells. Finally, the donor or gene corrected stem cells are infused into the patient where they engraft into the bone marrow and produce new blood and immune cells that form the basis of a reset and rebuilt blood and immune system. All transplants are categorized as either autologous or allogeneic, depending on the source of the new stem cells for the transplant.



In an autologous transplant, which is used for conditions such as multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and certain autoimmune diseases, the patient’s own stem cells are used. Autologous transplants also include stem cell gene therapies, in which cells are collected from the patient, edited to either insert a functioning gene into, or correct a defective gene within, such cells and then such cells are transplanted into the patient via infusion.



In an allogeneic transplant, used for conditions such as acute leukemias, MDS, genetic diseases and certain autoimmune diseases, patients receive cells from a stem cell donor. The preferred donor is a biological relative who has a well-matched immune system. The second option is a matched unrelated donor identified through a bone marrow donor registry. Transplant outcomes are not optimal with mismatched donors.

Current State of Conditioning Regimens



Currently, patients must receive highly toxic, potentially life-threatening and non-specific conditioning agents to prepare their bone marrow for transplantation with either donor stem cells or their own gene-edited stem cells. Current conditioning agents are genotoxic and are associated with major toxicities and adverse events such as oral mucositis, sepsis, veno-occlusive disease, bacteremia, pulmonary fibrosis, and GvHD in the near term. In the long term, patients must be counseled against risk of infertility of up to 70% and risk of secondary cancers of 5-10% after chemotherapy conditioning. Additionally, there is a treatment-related mortality risk associated with current conditioning regimens that ranges from 10% to more than 50% in older patients. Other limitations of chemotherapy-based conditioning include incomplete engraftment, transplant ineligibility and prolonged hospitalization.
Current State of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Grafts



Hematopoietic stem cell grafts currently have limitations around failed or poor engraftment with the risk of clinical relapse. Furthermore, GvHD is a high-risk short- and long-term adverse event associated with HCT as a result of donor T-cells, B-cells and NK-cells which are needed in unmodified donor HSC grafts to permit robust engraftment. Donor immune cells may react to the patient’s tissues as foreign leading to GvHD whereas newly produced immune cells are trained by the patient’s body to not act against the patient’s own cells. Due to this risk, patients also need to undergo long-term immunosuppression.
Our Solution and Product Candidates



We are developing briquilimab as a conditioning agent that could significantly expand the eligible patient population for both allogeneic and autologous gene edited hematopoietic stem cell therapies in addition to our mRNA engineered hematopoietic stem cells that could result in better transplant efficacy with reduced complications. Currently, approximately 20,000 patients receive allogeneic and autologous gene therapy transplants each year in the major global markets (the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Japan), and we believe this may grow to 80,000 patients with safe conditioning and more effective grafts.



Briquilimab is a targeted anti-CD117 (stem cell factor receptor) antibody which we are currently evaluating in two clinical trials for conditioning prior to stem cell transplant in patients with SCID or with MDS/AML. Briquilimab is designed to bind to CD117 with a greater affinity than SCF. By blocking signaling of the stem cell factor receptor, briquilimab may lead to depletion of stem cell from the bone marrow. Briquilimab was also designed to minimize any interaction with the immune system thereby reducing the risk of immune activation via mast cells or other pathways normally activated by antibodies.



We believe these attributes will allow briquilimab to potentially be used as a monotherapy or in combination to deplete normal and diseased stem cells. The blocking of SCF by briquilimab may remove a critical survival signal on stem cells that leads to their depletion in the bone marrow. Furthermore, the mechanism of action (“MOA”) of briquilimab on stem cells may be synergistic with other disruptors of stem cell survival such as radiation, azacytidine, and CD47. Our clinical strategy in SCD, AML and Higher Risk MDS aims to exploit this potentially synergistic mechanism to combine briquilimab and low dose radiation to fully clear both diseased and normal stem cells prior to transplantation of donor cells.



The monoclonal antibody isotype and other modifications of briquilimab were also chosen carefully to retain high affinity binding to the CD117 receptor and SCF signal blockade without recruiting other immune cells that could lead to receptor activation, mast cell degranulation or other off-target toxicities. For example, simply changing briquilimab from an IgG1 isotype to an IgG2 isotype would result in less potent inhibition of CD117, potentially decreasing the effect on mast and stem cell depletion. This finding and other data demonstrate that not all anti-CD117 antibodies behave equally or have the same MOA.



Other known approaches to target CD117, such as anti-CD117 antibodies linked to a toxin, may have off-target toxicity. In contrast to briquilimab, which provides a transient SCF signal blockade, a toxin linked anti-CD117 antibody requires internalization by CD117 expressing cells leading to cell death. Any CD117 expressing cell including stem cells, mast cells, germ cells and melanocytes may be affected by this mechanism. Furthermore, the complexity of an antibody-drug conjugate molecule adds to the manufacturing, clinical and regulatory risks of the drug development process, especially for a novel linker/payload combination that may be subject to different regulatory and Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls reviews.

Preclinical Transplant Data for Briquilimab — General



We conducted a preclinical study to determine if NHP HSCs are sufficiently similar to human HSCs to allow use of the same phenotype assays used in human studies to evaluate the effect of briquilimab on NHP hematopoiesis. This study tested, by flow cytometry, a technique used to measure physical and chemical characteristics of a population of cells, whether homologous subsets of NHP bone marrow express the same cellular markers as human HSCs (CD34, CD90, and CD117), and if the human antibody reagents used to identify these markers could also be used for NHP HSCs. Bone marrow samples (or bone marrow aspirates) of NHPs and humans were stained with the antibody reagents directed against human CD34, CD90, and CD117. HSCs in both human and NHP bone marrow were phenotypically identified using the anti-human antibodies against CD34 and CD90. A high percentage of human and NHP cells expressing CD34 and CD90 (also CD34+ and CD90+) also express CD117. Overall, we believe these data support the use of human antibody reagents for CD34 and CD90 to assess the effect of briquilimab on hematopoiesis in NHP in vitro and in vivo studies.

Right panel: the identified CD34+CD90- and CD34+CD90+ cells are then fluorescently labelled with 104D2 and briquilimab. Briquilimab and 104D2 non-competitively labeled the same population suggesting these antibodies bind different epitopes of NHP and human CD117.

Non-clinical studies in NHPs conducted at Stanford by Hye-Sook Kwon, Ph.D., now our Director, Biology and Translational Research, demonstrated briquilimab’s ability to deplete bone marrow HSCs in a large animal model (Figure 2). Non-clinical studies in “humanized” mice demonstrated both depletion of human HSCs and engraftment of allogeneic donor HSCs. These studies supported the potential for briquilimab to deplete human stem cells prior to stem cell transplant in the IND filings for the ongoing clinical trials designed to assess the safety and efficacy of briquilimab in HSC transplants.

CD34+ stem cells in the bone marrow of this NHP are transiently depleted. HSC depletion lasted up to 21 days in most animals and more than 42 days in one NHP receiving the highest dose.

Briquilimab for Severe Combined Immunodeficiency 



SCID is a genetically heterogeneous group of over 20 monogenic conditions of the immune system characterized by the lack of normal T lymphocyte development, in addition to deficiencies of B cells, NK cells, or both in some forms which is currently curable only by hematopoietic cell transplant. The incidence of SCID is estimated at one in 80,000 live births across all ethnic groups. Due to the toxicities associated with the chemotherapy regimens used in standard allogeneic HCT to deplete endogenous HSC, some centers do not use conditioning regimens. SCID patients who undergo unconditioned HCT have relatively improved overall survival but often experience incomplete immune reconstitution characterized by inadequate T cell numbers and/or ongoing deficiency of B cell humoral immunity. This issue occurs more frequently in those patients who do not have a human leukocyte antigen-matched donor and who therefore receive T cell depleted haploidentical donor grafts.



Patients who receive full or reduced doses of busulfan (a DNA damaging drug) tend to engraft well and have full lymphocyte reconstitution. However, due to busulfan’s off-target toxic effects, these patients experience both short- and long-term complications. Since these patients receive busulfan as infants, they experience chronic complications such as growth retardation, cognitive defects, craniofacial abnormalities, liver toxicity, seizures and endocrine defects, including infertility, and increased cancer risk.



Pre-clinical Data for Briquilimab for Severe Combined Immunodeficiency



The ability of briquilimab to deplete human hematopoiesis was evaluated in humanized immune deficient mice that were stably engrafted with human hematopoietic grafts at Stanford by Aaron Logan, M.D., Ph.D., et al. The mice were treated with a single dose of either 0.5 or 3.0 mg/kg briquilimab. No significant differences in depletion of human cells and HSCs after six weeks of treatment were noted between the two dose levels of briquilimab. After a single treatment with briquilimab, mice were depleted of human cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow. Human HSCs and progenitor cells (CD45+CD34+CD117+) in the bone marrow were substantially decreased for six weeks after treatment with briquilimab.



To model human transplantation with a briquilimab-based conditioning regimen, humanized immune deficient mice that had been stably engrafted with human hematopoietic cells underwent a second transplant using conditioning with briquilimab with or without the addition of an anti-CD52 antibody (alemtuzumab) that depletes human lymphocytes. The second human HSC graft was from a different donor and hence, was allogeneic to the first human graft. This second donor graft was transduced with a lentiviral vector to express the marker green fluorescence protein (“GFP”) to allow assessment of its engraftment. CD34+ GFP marked cells were injected into untreated control mice or mice that had been treated 23 – 25 days previously with briquilimab with or without anti-CD52. After six weeks, the blood of these secondarily transplanted mice was evaluated for evidence of GFP-marked second donor cells.

Figure 3: Briquilimab in addition to an anti-CD52 antibody demonstrated the highest level of engraftment. Engraftment was demonstrated by human CD45+ cells marked to express GFP.






Mice pre-treated with briquilimab and anti-CD52 demonstrated the highest level of engraftment, with 67% (six of nine) of human CD45+ cells also expressing GFP. In mice treated only with briquilimab, 43% (three of seven) were GFP positive. In control mice pre-treated with anti-CD52 alone, no mice (zero of seven) showed GFP expression, while 10% (one of ten) of the control mice not given any pre-treatment showed GFP expression (Figure 3).



We believe that this study can serve as a preclinical proof of concept of briquilimab conditioning enhanced engraftment with CD34+ progenitor cells in mice, suggesting it may be efficacious in an analogous clinical setting. Briquilimab appeared to be particularly effective in this setting when used along with an anti-CD52 antibody, which used a separate lymphodepleting agent to suppress rejection by the immune competent first allograft.

Clinical Data for Briquilimab for Severe Combined Immunodeficiency



We have an ongoing Phase 1/2 dose escalation open label clinical trial to evaluate briquilimab as the sole conditioning agent to achieve HSC engraftment in patients undergoing transplant for SCID. The primary endpoint in Phase 1 is to assess the safety and tolerability of briquilimab as a conditioning agent in SCID patients. The two primary efficacy endpoints in Phase 2 are the proportion of patients achieving adequate donor HSC engraftment and the proportion of patients achieving naïve CD4+ T cell production greater than or equal to 85 cells/uL, a level expected to provide immune reconstitution, during weeks 36 to 104 post-transplant. Secondary endpoints include durability of naïve T cell production, incidence and severity of GvHD, hematopoietic recovery and pharmacokinetic properties of briquilimab. Patients receive a single intravenous infusion of briquilimab on study day 0 in one of four dose cohorts: 0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 0.6mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg. Patients will be followed for five years following transplant. This trial is currently open for enrollment at multiple clinical trial sites in the United States.



Other studies of SCID patients have shown functional T and B cell reconstitution in patients achieving long-term myeloid donor chimerism of at least 3%. SCID patients who fail to achieve durable donor cell engraftment from a first transplant may not be candidates for a second transplant using current conditioning agents due to the toxicity of the conditioning regimen and fragile nature of most SCID patients. These patients may remain on medically supportive immune therapies such as intravenous immunoglobulin (“IVIG”) or receive an unconditioned “boost” transplant of donor cells which does not lead to sustained production of new immune cells.



We believe briquilimab has enabled immune reconstitution for patients based on naïve CD4+ T-cell levels and has shown clinical benefit in T-B- SCID patients in a re-transplant setting. Patients have shown resolution of chronic infections, independence from or reduction of IVIG therapy and antibody response to vaccine challenge. Through December 31, 2022 in this open label clinical trial, ten T-B- SCID re-transplant patients have been treated in the ongoing SCID Phase 1/2 study. Seven of the ten transplanted patients have shown engraftment of donor cells and production of functional immune cells with up to three years of follow up. No briquilimab treatment-related SAEs have been reported through December 31, 2022 in this clinical trial.



We expect to complete enrollment in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial in 2023.

Briquilimab for Stem Cell Transplant in Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndrome



AML is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow, diagnosed in about 42,000 patients annually within the major global markets. It is primarily a disease of the elderly and is the most common type of acute leukemia diagnosed in adults. Patients with AML are deemed eligible for stem cell transplantation based on criteria which includes patient fitness (age and comorbidities) and response to initial treatment, comprising of about 40% of newly diagnosed AML patients. However, stem cell transplants are administered to approximately 40% of the eligible patient population due to current challenges with highly toxic conditioning regimens. Currently, approximately 8,000 patients with AML receive a stem cell transplant annually in the major global markets.



MDS is a group of disorders of the bone marrow where hematopoietic stem cells fail to properly differentiate into mature blood cells, leading to low blood cell count. Approximately 29,000 patients are diagnosed with MDS annually in the major global markets. Of all newly diagnosed MDS patients, about 35% have intermediate to higher-risk disease and about 30% of those are eligible for HCT based on age, comorbidities and blast count. However, about 60% of MDS patients do not receive transplants, even though they are otherwise eligible, due to the current challenges with highly toxic conditioning regimens. Currently, approximately 2,500 patients with MDS receive HCT each year.



HCT offers the only known potentially curative therapy for many forms of AML and for MDS. Standard of care conditioning regimens can be divided into three groups: myeloablative conditioning, reduced intensity conditioning and non-myeloablative conditioning. Myeloablative conditioning with high dose busulfan, high dose melphalan or high dose radiation is the most aggressive approach and is associated with the lowest rates of disease relapse. However, due to significant toxicities, including treatment-related mortality, this approach is reserved for the most fit and younger patients. Reduced intensity conditioning with lower dose busulfan or lower dose melphalan can be used for a wider group of patients, but due to substantial toxicities, many patients remain ineligible. Non-myeloablative conditioning with low dose radiation (200 – 450 cGy, or centigray, a unit of radiation of exposure) is well tolerated but is associated with lower rates of successful donor chimerism and increased relapse rates compared to myeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning.



Due to their age and co-morbidities, older (60 years and older) and less fit MDS and AML patients are typically unable to tolerate more intensive therapy and the toxicities associated with such treatments, and thus, have a worse prognosis than younger, fitter patients. Thus, safe and effective conditioning prior to HCT represents an unmet medical need for MDS and AML patients.



Preclinical Data for Briquilimab for Myelodysplastic Syndrome



Preclinical studies of immune deficient mice engrafted with MDS HSCs from patients with “high-risk and very high-risk disease” per IPSS-R criteria conducted at Stanford by Wendy Pang, M.D., Ph.D., now our Senior Vice President of Research and Translational Medicine, demonstrate the utility of anti-CD117 antibodies in the treatment of MDS. Mice xenografted with higher-risk MDS HSCs were treated with anti-human CD117 monoclonal antibody (“mAb”), SR-1 (the parent clone to briquilimab). Initial studies showed administration of either SR-1 or briquilimab resulted in well-tolerated and sustained depletion of MDS cells obtained from lower-risk MDS patients. Treatment of mice xenografted with higher-risk MDS HSCs cells resulted in transient depletion (Figure 4). Given the transient depletion of higher-risk MDS cells, studies were conducted to determine whether an anti-CD117 antibody followed by a normal human HSC allograft would lead to long-term disease amelioration of higher-risk disease. Results showed greater than 95% cytogenetically normal CD45+ cells 12 weeks after allograft transplant (Figure 4).





13







Figure 4: (A) CD117 mAb depletes MDS stem cells as demonstrated by decreasing HSC chimerism over time. (B) Normal stem cell engraftment occurs after stem cell depletion as shown by greater than 95% cytogenetically normal CD45+ cells 12 weeks after transplant in four higher-risk MDS-xenografted mice. (C) Normal blood formation results after stem cell engraftment with human cell lineages for T cells (CD3+), B cells (CD19+) and myeloid cells (CD13/33+) in the bone marrow of the four high-risk mice.











Mice xenografted with MDS HSCs from lower-risk or higher-risk patients were treated with SR-1 concurrently with an anti-mouse CD117 mAb, ACK2, to suppress endogenous mouse HSCs, and then transplanted with normal human UCB. Twelve weeks after this UCB HSC transplantation, both human myeloid and lymphoid cells like T cells and B cells were observed in the bone marrow (Figure 4), indicative of successful engraftment and sustained hematopoiesis by healthy UCB HSCs for both risk categories. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies assessing clonal cytogenetic abnormalities confirmed that human CD45+ cells in both groups were predominantly (greater than 95%) cytogenetically normal in all SR-1 treated and UCB HSC engrafted mice. In contrast, MDS xenografted mice treated with the control antibody showed a persistence of high levels of MDS cells (greater than 95%) and were without second donor HSC engraftment.



Clinical Data for Briquilimab for Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndrome



We have an ongoing open label Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of briquilimab conditioning, in combination with low dose radiation (200-300 cGy) and fludarabine, in patients with AML or MDS undergoing blood stem cell transplantation. At clinical trial entry for the dose finding portion, all patients were transplant eligible but most still had evidence of measurable residual disease (MRD positive) as detected by cytogenetics, flow cytometry or next-generation sequencing. The dose of briquilimab is 0.6 mg/kg, fludarabine is administered at 30 mg/m2/day on transplant days -4, -3, and -2, and total body irradiation (“TBI”) is delivered at 200 or 300 cGy on the day of transplant. The primary endpoints are to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic parameters of briquilimab. Secondary endpoints include depletion of host HSCs, donor engraftment, donor chimerism, MRD clearance, non-relapse mortality, event-free survival and overall survival. Enrolled patients will be followed for one year. The overall study duration is anticipated to be approximately two years.



We have completed enrollment in this Phase 1 study. 31 MDS/AML patients have been enrolled. There were no briquilimab-related SAEs. All patients demonstrated a reduction of neutrophil counts (“ANC”) below 500/uL following a single infusion of briquilimab (0.6 mg/kg) in combination with 200-300 cGy TBI and three days of 30 mg /m2/day fludarabine. Neutrophils are the most common type of white blood cell and are the first cells to engraft. Following transplant, all patients showed successful donor engraftment as evidenced by a recovery of neutrophil counts exceeding 500/uL in 13-24 days (Figure 5).





14







Figure 5: Neutrophil depletion and recovery in patients of the Phase 1 MDS/AML clinical trial. All patients demonstrated ANC greater than 500/uL within 13-24 days after transplant.







Subanalysis of the first twelve AML patients, median age of 70 years and all of whom were at least one year post-transplant, showed 67% relapse free survival, 75% overall survival and 8% non-relapse mortality at one year post-transplant. Nine of the twelve AML patients entered the trial with MRD, detected by either flow cytometry or next generation sequencing, and six of these patients no longer had evidence of MRD at one year post-transplant, with median time to MRD clearance of 90 days post-transplant (Figure 6). 67% of the AML patients are alive and without evidence of AML MRD at one year post-transplant. The trial has completed enrollment. We expect to present additional data from this study, including data from the MDS patients, in 2023.



Figure 6: Briquilimab MDS/AML Phase 1 preliminary clinical results in the first twelve AML patients.









15







No briquilimab-related SAEs have been reported, including no cases of oral mucositis, no cases of veno-occlusive disease. Among the 31 patients enrolled to date, there have been four cases of grade 2 acute GvHD, one case of late onset grade 3 GvHD, four cases of mild chronic GvHD and four cases of moderate chronic GvHD. SAEs have been reported in twenty patients, including infections, cardiovascular events, disease progression or relapse and secondary graft failure, which is loss of a previously functioning graft. None were related to treatment as determined by the investigator.



Briquilimab for Fanconi Anemia 



FA is a rare but serious blood disorder that prevents bone marrow from making sufficient new red blood cells. It can also cause the bone marrow to make abnormal blood cells. FA typically presents at birth or early in childhood between five and ten years of age. Ultimately, it can lead to serious complications, including bone marrow failure, severe aplastic anemia and cancers such as AML and MDS. Treatment may include blood transfusions or medicine to create more red blood cells, but HCT is the only cure. Briquilimab for FA patients is being evaluated in a clinical trial collaboration with Stanford. Stanford has reported data for the first two patients, showing 100% donor myeloid chimerism and recovery of normal blood counts. Additional enrollment is ongoing.
Briquilimab for Sickle Cell Disease



SCD is an inherited blood disorder that affects the hemoglobin protein in red blood cells that delivers oxygen to tissues and organs. Approximately 300,000 infants are born with SCD annually worldwide, and the number of cases is expected to significantly increase. Currently, HCT is the only cure available for SCD. Allogeneic transplants as well as new autologous gene-edited transplants both currently rely on myeloablative conditioning with either busulfan or melphalan. We believe briquilimab could be a significant advance for patients, replacing these current agents which are known to be genotoxic and associated with limited efficacy and serious adverse effects, including veno-occlusive disease, infertility and secondary malignancies. Briquilimab for SCD patients is currently being evaluated in a clinical trial collaboration with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (“NHLBI”). The NHLBI has reported data for the first three patients in this study, showing 100% donor myeloid chimerism at 30 days and increased levels of hemoglobin versus pre-transplant baseline. Additional enrollment is ongoing.  
Briquilimab for Chronic Granulomatous Disease



CGD is a rare, inherited disease of the immune system that develops in infancy or early childhood and results in severe and sometimes life-threatening infections. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant is a proven cure for CGD. However, its use is limited because of the associated serious adverse effects and limited efficacy of current conditioning agents used to deplete stem cells in preparation for transplantation. Briquilimab for CGD patients will be evaluated in a clinical trial collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Enrollment in this study is ongoing.



Briquilimab for GATA-2 MDS



GATA-2 MDS is a type of MDS characterized by mutations in the GATA-2 gene resulting in complex phenotypes including increased risk of infection, deficiencies of immune cells such as B- and NK-cells and overall poor prognosis. Allogeneic stem cell transplant may be used to cure these patients; however, use of current conditioning agents can be difficult due to the fragile health status of these patients. Briquilimab-based conditioning for GATA-2 MDS patients will be evaluated in a clinical trial collaboration with the National Cancer Institute (“NCI”). We expect this study to start enrollment in 2022.



Briquilimab for Gene Therapy



Every gene therapy in academia or industry that modifies HSCs also requires pre-transplant conditioning to make space in the patient’s bone marrow for the gene therapy to engraft. These types of gene therapies address a broad range of disease including heme disorders (e.g., SCD, beta thalassemia, FA), immune disorders (e.g., SCID, CGD, leukocyte adhesion deficiency), lysosomal storage disorders (e.g., Fabry, Gaucher, Pompe), neurologic disorders (e.g., frontotemporal dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) and bone disorders (e.g., infant malignant osteoporosis) to name a few. Toxic alkylators like busulfan are still the standard conditioning regimens on which these gene therapies rely. As a result, their curative benefit is limited to patients that can tolerate the conditioning. Furthermore, gene therapy trials have also been halted by the FDA due to secondary malignancies discovered in study patients, which is a well-known risk of genotoxic conditioning. We believe that a briquilimab based conditioning regimen may be an effective alternative to toxic alkylators like busulfan for conditioning prior to the infusion of gene modified stem cells and are exploring potential studies for this use.

mRNA-Modified Hematopoietic Stem Cell Therapy



Our mRNA platform includes multiple approaches to developing product candidates that are currently in preclinical development and are designed to overcome key limitations of allogeneic and autologous gene-edited stem cell grafts. By using mRNA delivery or gene editing we believe we can reprogram allogeneic donor or gene-edited stem cells to have a transient proliferative and survival advantage, potentially leading to higher engraftment rates and reduced or eliminated GvHD by elimination of co-transplanted donor immune cells in allogeneic transplants.



We are evaluating multiple approaches to use mRNA to increase engraftment of HSCs. One approach is to increase expression of CXCR4, a cell surface protein involved in cellular homing to the bone marrow. Another approach is to use mRNA to transiently increase expression of known variants of the stem cell factor receptor that signal independent of ligand (stem cell factor) concentration. Another approach in preclinical development is to use mRNA delivery or gene editing to express a variant of the stem cell factor receptor that is resistant to briquilimab. We are also working on other approaches to increase stem cell competitiveness that are not related to stem cell factor receptor signaling or cellular homing.  



Initial in vitro experimental results in human cell lines show that expression of a constitutively active variant of the stem cell factor receptor can lead to cell line proliferation independent of stem cell factor concentration. In addition, these variant cells are not affected by briquilimab since the engineered cells proliferate independent of receptor signaling. Other in vitro experiments have shown that mRNA can be used to express these receptor variants and other target proteins, such as CXCR4, transiently on the cell surface. We have also identified potential receptor modifications that will keep stem cell factor binding intact but decrease or eliminate briquilimab binding.



In the setting of autologous gene edited stem cells, these technologies could lead to faster and more complete engraftment of edited cells without the need for toxic conditioning. Depending on the Jasper technology used, additional infusions of gene-modified cells may potentially be given to patients with low or fading responses to target protein production.



In the setting of allogeneic transplant, pure stem cell grafts can be used in place of today’s replete or modified grafts. Similar to the autologous setting, we believe these technologies can lead to faster and more complete engraftment of donor stem cells without the need for toxic conditioning. In addition, by eliminating the need for donor passenger lymphocytes to drive engraftment, we can potentially eliminate the risk of GvHD and the need for long-term immune suppression. If approved, this approach may also increase the potential for use of partially matched grafts and expand the potential donor pool available for any given patient.





17








We are currently conducting an in-vivo preclinical assessment of various mRNA stem cell product constructs and plan to present data in 2023.






Opportunity Areas



There are other conditions and potential applications for briquilimab and the mRNA platform. We have assessed the existing therapeutic mast cell market, proliferative disorders of the stem cell and stem cell transplant market on a per-indication basis to estimate the potential number of patients that could benefit from our product candidates.
Mast Cell Disorders 



Mast cells may also be the key cellular target for other inflammatory or autoimmune diseases such as chronic inducible urticaria (“CIndU”), prurigo nodularis, eosinophilic esophagitis, allergic asthma or inflammatory bowel disease. Similar to CSU, CIndU is characterized by development of hives and/or angioedema and redness in the skin. Unlike CSU, the trigger for CIndU patients can be diagnosed by assessment of various common provocations such as cold, heat, pressure, vibration and others. CIndU is thought to affect over one million patients in the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. Approximately 40% of these patients’ CIndU is not controlled by first line anti-histamines and these patients could be eligible for biologic therapy depending on disease severity.



Prurigo Nodularis is also a disease that manifests in the skin. Patients develop severe itch and firm bumps on the skin, called nodules, that may lead to loss of sleep and bleeding due to scratching. Degranulation of mast cells in the skin is thought to trigger peripheral sensory neurons in the skin leading to itch. Various medications are used to treat Prurigo Nodularis including anti-itch creams and topical steroids. For cases that remain uncontrolled physicians may prescribe anti-histamines or biologics such as dupilumab.



Eosinophilic esophagitis is an immune disorder leading to build up of eosinophils in the esophagus and causes difficulty in eating, chronic reflux and/or the sensation of heartburn. Along with the buildup of eosinophils, there is typically buildup of other immune cells in the affected area including mast cells, basophils and lymphocytes. Patients may be treated with changes to diet, use of proton pump inhibitors, antihistamines and dupilumab.



Allergic asthma is a form of asthma triggered by specific allergens that leads to constriction of smooth muscles in the airways, cellular infiltration of various immune mediators and excess production of mucus. Patients with allergic asthma may have an increased number of mast cells in the bronchi and may be responsive to agents that modulate mast cell response, including anti-histamines and anti IgE monoclonal antibody therapy.



Hematopoietic Stem Cell-Based Gene Therapies



The combination of stem cell transplantation and gene therapy has shown the potential to correct pathological genetic mutations but also the same limitations as unmodified stem cell transplantation, which include the toxicities of current conditioning agents. Furthermore, stem cell gene therapy requires larger doses of genetically modified stem cells for proper engraftment. We believe our product candidates can improve the field of stem cell gene therapy and address currently identified challenges.



In the United States alone, over 100,000 patients suffer from SCD, while about 52,000 patients are affected in the major markets in Europe. Approximately 58,000 patients from this pool are eligible for HCT or gene therapy as they have severe SCD.



Approximately 2,700 patients in the United States suffer from beta-thalassemia and about 16,000 in the European Union suffer from it annually. Approximately 70% of these patients can be classified to have beta-thalassemia major and, of that patient population, about 20%, or 2,600 patients, are eligible for stem cell transplant.

Sales and Marketing



We do not currently have sales and marketing infrastructure to support commercial launch of our product candidates, if approved. We may build such capabilities in North America prior to potential launch of briquilimab. Outside of North America, we may rely on licensing, co-sale and co-promotion agreements with strategic partners for the commercialization of our product candidates. If we build a commercial infrastructure to support marketing in North America, such commercial infrastructure could be expected to include a targeted sales force supported by sales management, internal sales support, an internal marketing group and distribution support. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure internally, we would have to invest financial and management resources, some of which would have to be deployed prior to any confirmation that briquilimab will be approved.
Research and Development



We invest significantly in our research and development efforts, to discover and validate therapeutics while improving our processes and approach to drug making. We strive to progress candidates that can address unmet or underserved clinical needs and favor programs with well-validated targets and defined regulatory approval paths. Our R&D team has played key roles in discovering and developing a number of promising candidates over the past 20 plus years while at Jasper, and while at Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Portola, Amgen, Alexion and others. They have leveraged experience, insights and capabilities to optimize development, along with fostering collaboration with external partners to innovate and expand into potential additional indications. Our current development-stage portfolio consists of two product candidates discovered through collaboration and our internal research efforts.
Manufacturing



We do not currently own or operate any manufacturing facility. We rely on contract manufacturing organizations to produce our drug candidates in accordance with cGMP regulations for use in our clinical studies. The manufacture of pharmaceuticals is subject to extensive cGMP regulations, which impose various procedural and documentation requirements and govern all areas of record keeping, production processes and controls, personnel and quality control. Under our license agreement with Amgen, we have received a substantial amount of drug product to support initiation of our planned clinical trials of briquilimab. In November 2019, we entered into development and manufacturing agreements with Lonza relating to the manufacturing of briquilimab and product quality testing. The facility of Lonza in Slough, United Kingdom is responsible for production and testing of drug substance. The facility of Lonza in Stein, Switzerland is responsible for production and testing of drug product. Labelling, packaging and storage of finished drug product is provided by PCI Pharma Services, in San Diego, California. Our agreement with Lonza includes certain limitations on our ability to enter into supply arrangements with any other supplier without Lonza’s consent. In addition, Lonza has the right to increase the prices it charges us for certain supplies depending on a number of factors, some of which are outside of our control.
Government Regulation



Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, pricing, reimbursement, sales, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products, including biological products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.



Licensure and Regulation of Biologics in the United States



In the United States, our product candidates are regulated as biological products, or biologics, under the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”) and the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its implementing regulations and guidance. The failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, including preclinical testing, clinical testing, the approval process, or post-approval process, may subject an applicant to delays in the conduct of the study, regulatory review, and approval, and/or administrative or judicial sanctions.




21








An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new biologic in the United States generally must satisfactorily complete each of the following steps:




● | preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies all performed in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice (“GLP”) regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | completion of the manufacture, under cGMP conditions, of the drug substance and drug product that the sponsor intends to use in human clinical trials along with required analytical and stability testing;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an IRB representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, potency, and purity of the product candidate for each proposed indication, in accordance with cGCPs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preparation and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application (“BLA”) for a biologic product requesting marketing for one or more proposed indications, including submission of detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product in clinical development and proposed labelling;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities, including those of third parties, at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of the preclinical studies and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GLP, as applicable, and good clinical practices (“GCP”), and the integrity of clinical data in support of the BLA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | payment of user Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) securing FDA approval of the BLA and licensure of the new biologic product; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) and any post-approval studies or other post-marketing commitments required by the FDA.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies and Investigational New Drug Application



Before testing any biologic product candidate in humans, the product candidate must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate the potential for efficacy and toxicity in animal studies. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application.




22








An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about the product or conduct of the proposed clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In that case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns before the clinical trials can begin or recommence.



As a result, submission of the IND may result in the FDA not allowing the trials to commence or allowing the trial to commence on the terms originally specified by the sponsor in the IND. If the FDA raises concerns or questions either during this initial 30-day period, or at any time during the IND review process, it may choose to impose a partial or complete clinical hold. Clinical holds are imposed by the FDA whenever there is concern for patient safety, may be a result of new data, findings, or developments in clinical, preclinical, and/or chemistry, manufacturing, and controls or where there is non-compliance with regulatory requirements. This order issued by the FDA would delay either a proposed clinical trial or cause suspension of an ongoing trial, until all outstanding concerns have been adequately addressed and the FDA has notified the company that investigations may proceed. This could cause significant delays or difficulties in completing our planned clinical trial or future clinical trials in a timely manner.



Human Clinical Trials in Support of a BLA



Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients with the disease or condition to be treated under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator in accordance with GCP requirements. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.



A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. When a foreign clinical trial is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the trial complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the trial as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, the FDA requires that such trials be conducted in accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee and informed consent from participants. The GCP requirements encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical trials. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical trials, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign trials are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for clinical trials in the United States.



Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB either centrally or individually at each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, clinical trial design, patient informed consent, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. The FDA, IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive GCP rules and the requirements for informed consent.



Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board (“DSMB”). This group may recommend continuation of the trial as planned, changes in trial conduct, or cessation of the trial at designated check points based on certain available data from the trial to which only the DSMB has access.



Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Additional studies may be required after approval.




● | Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, including adverse effects, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion, and pharmacodynamics in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients, such as cancer patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






23








● | Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications and determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3 clinical trials proceed if the Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken within an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy, and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. A well-controlled, statistically robust Phase 3 trial may be designed to deliver the data that regulatory authorities will use to decide whether or not to approve, and, if approved, how to appropriately label a biologic; such Phase 3 studies are referred to as “pivotal.”
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In some cases, the FDA may approve a BLA for a product but require the sponsor to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product’s safety and effectiveness after licensure. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of biologics approved under accelerated approval regulations. If the FDA approves a product while a company has ongoing clinical trials that were not necessary for approval, a company may be able to use the data from these clinical trials to meet all or part of any Phase 4 clinical trial requirement or to request a change in the product labeling. The failure to exercise due diligence with regard to conducting Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products.



Information about applicable clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website.



Compliance with cGMP Requirements



Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in full compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products like biologics whose attributes cannot be precisely defined.



Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of products must also register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Any product manufactured by or imported from a facility that has not registered, whether foreign or domestic, is deemed misbranded under the FDCA. Establishments may be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMPs and other laws. Inspections must follow a “risk-based schedule” that may result in certain establishments being inspected more frequently. Manufacturers may also have to provide, on request, electronic or physical records regarding their establishments. Delaying, denying, limiting, or refusing inspection by the FDA may lead to a product being deemed to be adulterated.



Review and Approval of a BLA



The results of product candidate development, preclinical testing, and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting a license to market the product. The BLA must contain extensive manufacturing information and detailed information on the composition of the product and proposed labeling as well as payment of a user fee. Under federal law, the submission of most BLAs is subject to an application user fee. The sponsor of a licensed BLA is also subject to an annual program fee. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for products with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses.




24








The FDA has 60 days after submission of the application to conduct an initial review to determine whether it is sufficient to accept for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the application. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA, the FDA has ten months in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months for a priority review of the application. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs. The review process may often be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or if the applicant otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.



Under the PHSA, the FDA may approve a BLA if it determines that the product is safe, pure, and potent, and the facility where the product will be manufactured meets standards designed to ensure that it continues to be safe, pure, and potent. On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the application and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities and any FDA audits of preclinical and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. If the application is not approved, the FDA will issue a complete response letter, or CRL, which will contain the conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the application, and when possible will outline recommended actions the sponsor might take to obtain approval of the application. Sponsors that receive a CRL may submit to the FDA information that represents a complete response to the issues identified by the FDA.



The FDA may also refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation, and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. In particular, the FDA may refer applications for novel biologic products or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates, and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.



If the FDA approves a new product, it may limit the approved indication(s) for use of the product. It may also require that contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may call for post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, to further assess the product’s efficacy and/or safety after approval. The agency may also require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use.



Expedited Review Programs



The FDA is authorized to expedite the review of BLAs in several ways. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND. Candidate products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track application before the application is complete, a process known as rolling review.





25







Any product candidate submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval.




● | Breakthrough therapy designation. To qualify for the breakthrough therapy program, product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that such product candidates may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review and rolling review.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Priority review. A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, it would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention compared to marketed products. The FDA aims to complete its review of priority review applications within six months as opposed to 10 months for standard review.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Accelerated approval. Drug or biologic products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval. Accelerated approval means that a product candidate may be approved on the basis of adequate and well controlled clinical trials establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity and prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Regenerative advanced therapy. With passage of the 21st Century Cures Act (the “Cures Act”) in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with the FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




None of these expedited programs change the standards for approval but they may help expedite the development or approval process of product candidates.



Post-Approval Regulation



If regulatory approval for marketing of a product or new indication for an existing product is obtained, the sponsor will be required to comply with all regular post-approval regulatory requirements as well as any post-approval requirements that the FDA have imposed as part of the approval process. The sponsor will be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling requirements. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon manufacturers. Accordingly, the sponsor and its third-party manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements.




26








A product may also be subject to official lot release, meaning that the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official lot release, the manufacturer must submit samples of each lot, together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot, to the FDA. The FDA may in addition perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. Finally, the FDA will conduct laboratory research related to the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of pharmaceutical products.



Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:




● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product recall, seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------




Pharmaceutical products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Although healthcare providers may prescribe products for uses not described in the drug’s labeling, known as off-label uses, in their professional judgment, drug manufacturers are prohibited from soliciting, encouraging or promoting unapproved uses of a product. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.



The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of prescription drug products placed on the market. This regulation includes, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. Promotional claims about a drug’s safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the drug is approved. After approval, a drug product generally may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA, as reflected in the product’s prescribing information.



If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.

Regulation and Procedures Governing Approval of Medicinal Products in the European Union



In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety, and efficacy, and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales, and distribution of drug products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. Specifically, the process governing approval of medicinal products in the European Union generally follows the same lines as in the United States. It entails satisfactory completion of preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication. It also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities of a marketing authorization application (“MAA”) and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the European Union.
Clinical Trial Approval



Pursuant to Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union was implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of a European Union member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted, or in multiple member states if the clinical trial is to be conducted in a number of member states. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.



In April 2014, the European Union adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which became effective on January 31, 2022. It overhauled the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the European Union. Specifically, the new legislation, which is directly applicable in all member states, is aimed at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. For instance, the new Clinical Trials Regulation provides for a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point, the Clinical Trials Information System (“CTIS”), and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications.



The conduct of all clinical trials commenced in the European Union prior to January 31, 2022 will continue to be bound by the previously applicable provisions. However, if a clinical trial continues for more than three years after January 31, 2022, the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial. As of January 31, 2023, all new trial authorizations must be applied for under the Clinical Trials Regulation and utilize CTIS.



Marketing Authorization



To obtain a marketing authorization for a product under the European Union regulatory system, an applicant must submit an MAA, either under a centralized procedure administered by the EMA or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in European Union Member States (decentralized procedure, national procedure, or mutual recognition procedure). A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the European Union. Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 provides that prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, an applicant must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA approved Pediatric Investigation Plan (“PIP”) covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product specific waiver, class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP.



The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all European Union member states. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including products for the treatment of cancer. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. Manufacturers must demonstrate the quality, safety, and efficacy of their products to the EMA, which provides an opinion regarding the MAA. The European Commission grants or refuses marketing authorization in light of the opinion delivered by the EMA.

Under the centralized procedure, the CHMP established at the EMA is responsible for conducting an initial assessment of a product. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such a request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.



Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement



Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we may seek regulatory approval by the FDA or other government authorities. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use any product candidates we may develop unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of such product candidates. Even if any product candidates we may develop are approved, sales of such product candidates will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers, and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, such product candidates. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.



In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover any product candidates we may develop could reduce physician utilization of such product candidates once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party reimbursement and coverage may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. In addition, any companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products will apply to any companion diagnostics.



The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of pharmaceuticals have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.



If we obtain approval in the future to market in the United States any product candidates we may develop, we may be required to provide discounts or rebates under government healthcare programs or to certain government and private purchasers in order to obtain coverage under federal healthcare programs such as Medicaid. Participation in such programs may require us to track and report certain drug prices. We may be subject to fines and other penalties if we fail to report such prices accurately.



Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for any product candidates we may develop will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of any product candidates we may develop to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts.

In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies (so called health technology assessments) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product, or they may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic, and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states), can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved in those countries.



Healthcare Law and Regulation



Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors, and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain our business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:

● | the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious, or fraudulent or knowingly making, using, or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the CMS within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians, as defined by such law, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Further, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. In addition, certain state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives in the jurisdiction. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), thus complicating compliance efforts.

Employees and Human Capital


As of December 31, 2022, we employed 35 full-time employees. The 35 full-time employees were engaged in research and development, operations, finance, and business development. Eleven employees held Ph.D. degrees; one held M.D. degrees; and one held a VMD. Our employees are not represented by labor unions or covered under any collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.



Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards.



Facilities


We lease approximately 13,400 square feet of space for our headquarters in Redwood City, California under an agreement that expires in August 2026. Thereafter, at our option, we may extend the term for an additional five years to August 2031. We believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet our current needs, and that suitable additional alternative spaces will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms.
Indemnification and Insurance



Our business exposes us to potential liability including, but not limited to, potential liability for (i) non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and (ii) employment-related claims. In certain circumstances, we may also be liable for the acts or omissions of others, such as suppliers of goods or services.




We attempt to manage our potential liability to third parties through contractual protection (such as indemnification and limitation of liability provisions) in our contracts and through insurance. The contractual indemnification provisions vary in scope and generally do not protect us against all potential liabilities. In addition, in the event that we seek to enforce such an indemnification provision, the indemnifying party may not have sufficient resources to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations or may otherwise not comply with its contractual obligations.



We currently maintain insurance coverage with limits we believe to be appropriate. The coverage provided by such insurance may not be adequate for all claims made, and such claims may be contested by applicable insurance carriers.



Organization



We were organized as a corporation under the laws of the State of Delaware on August 13, 2019 under the name “Amplitude Healthcare Acquisition Corporation”. On September 24, 2021, we consummated the previously announced Business Combination (pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, dated May 5, 2021, by and among AMHC, Merger Sub and Old Jasper). Pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, a Business Combination or Reverse Recapitalization for accounting purposes between AMHC and Old Jasper was effected through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Old Jasper with Old Jasper surviving as AMHC’s wholly-owned subsidiary. In connection with the Business Combination, AMHC changed its name from Amplitude Healthcare Acquisition Corporation to Jasper Therapeutics, Inc.
