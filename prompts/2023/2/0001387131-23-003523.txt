ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 
 Company Overview         Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (“we,” “us,” “our,” “Adamis” or the “company”) is a specialty biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products in various therapeutic areas, including allergy, opioid overdose, respiratory and inflammatory disease.  Our products in the allergy, respiratory, and opioid overdose markets include: SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection 0.3mg, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in 2017 for use in the emergency treatment of acute allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, for patients weighing 66 pounds or more; SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection 0.15mg, which was approved by the FDA in September 2018, for use in the treatment of anaphylaxis for patients weighing 33-65 pounds; and ZIMHI (naloxone HCL Injection, USP) 5 mg/0.5 mL, which was approved by the FDA in October 2021 for the treatment of opioid overdose.  In June 2020, we entered into a license agreement with a third party entity to license rights under patents, patent applications and related know-how of licensor relating to Tempol, an investigational drug. As previously disclosed in our filings with the SEC, in September 2021 we commenced patient dosing in a Phase 2/3 clinical trial to examine the safety and efficacy of Tempol in COVID-19 patients. The Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, overseeing the Phase 2/3 clinical trial met in March and June 2022 to evaluate interim clinical and safety data and, following its evaluation, recommended that the study continue as planned. On September 21, 2022, we announced that the DSMB’s third interim analysis of the Phase 2/3 clinical trial, which was the first interim review where the DSMB evaluated the primary efficacy endpoint, determined that the trial did not achieve its primary endpoint and recommended that the study be halted early due to lack of efficacy. Based on the recommendation from the DSMB, we halted the trial and have stopped further development of Tempol.
     On October 3, 2022, we announced that we initiated a process to explore a range of strategic and financing alternatives focused on maximizing stockholder value, and that we intended to pursue expense reduction measures. Such measures included, without limitation, employee headcount reductions and reduction or discontinuation of certain product development programs. We engaged the investment bank Raymond James & Associates, Inc. to act as strategic advisor to assist us in evaluating certain alternatives.
 
Recent Developments
 On February 27, 2023, we announced we had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”) dated as of February 24, 2023, with DMK Pharmaceuticals Corporation (“DMK”), a New Jersey corporation, and Aardvark Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adamis (“Merger Sub”). Under the terms of and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions described in the Merger Agreement, including approval of certain matters relating to the transaction by the company’s stockholders and DMK’s stockholders, DMK will merge with and into Merger Sub (the “Merger”), with Merger Sub surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adamis. DMK Pharmaceuticals is a clinical stage neuro-biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of products for the treatment of a variety of neuro-based disorders with significant unmet medical needs. The current DMK product candidates have been selected and developed from a proprietary portfolio of small molecule neuropeptide analogues and include product candidates for the treatment of opioid use disorder, chronic pain, Parkinson’s disease, and bladder problems.
 At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each share of common stock of DMK (other than dissenting shares, if any) will generally be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of Adamis common stock (“Common Stock”) equal to the exchange ratio as defined in the Merger Agreement and described below; however, if a DMK shareholder’s receipt of such shares would result in the shareholder’s beneficial ownership of Common Stock exceeding a certain percentage limit specified in the Merger Agreement, then the shareholder will, in lieu of receiving shares of Common Stock in excess of such beneficial ownership limit, receive shares of a new series of Adamis convertible preferred stock (the “Series Preferred”) that is generally convertible into the number of shares of Common Stock that the stockholder would have been entitled to receive in excess of such beneficial ownership limit, but that is subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations on conversion and voting rights (the shares of Common Stock and Series Preferred that are issuable pursuant to the Merger Agreement, sometimes referred to as the “Merger Consideration Shares”). The number of shares of Common Stock that will be issuable (including upon conversion of shares of Series Preferred issuable in the transaction without regard to beneficial ownership conversion limitations) to holders of outstanding shares of DMK common stock (other than holders, if any, of dissenting shares) will be determined by dividing $27,000,000 by the average closing prices of the Common Stock for the five trading days ending one trading day before the Effective Time (adjusted to give effect to the reverse stock split of the Common Stock); and the exchange ratio will be determined by dividing such number of shares by the number of outstanding DMK shares of common stock immediately before the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Merger Agreement also provides that if the foregoing calculation of the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable to DMK stockholders (including shares issuable upon conversion of the Series Preferred without regarding to beneficial ownership conversion limitations) would result in the holders of Common Stock immediately before the Effective Time owning less than a majority of the total number of post-merger outstanding shares of Common Stock (including shares issuable upon exercise of assumed DMK stock options) after the Effective Time (the “Adamis Percentage Threshold”), then the number of Adamis shares issuable to the DMK stockholder pursuant to the Merger (and with respect to the Series Preferred determined on an as-converted basis) will be a number such that the holders of Common Stock immediately before the Effective Time hold a number of shares of Common Stock immediately after the Effective Time equal to the Adamis Percentage Threshold.
 As contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Adamis intends to hold a special meeting of its stockholders and seek the approval of its stockholders to, among other things, vote on certain proposals the approval of which is necessary in order to effect the transaction, including a proposal to (a) issue the Merger Consideration Shares issuable in connection with the Merger, pursuant to the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) and (b) amend the company’s restated certificate of incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of the Common Stock, in a ratio to be set by the Adamis board of directors and, assuming the issuance of Merger Consideration Shares is approved and other closing conditions described in the Merger Agreement are satisfied, determined prior to the closing of the Merger. The reverse stock split is intended to provide sufficient shares in order to complete the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as well as to increase the trading prices of the company’s common stock in order to satisfy the minimum bid price requirements for continued listing of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market.

The Merger Agreement contains a number of customary representations, warranties, and covenants of both parties, including, among others, covenants relating to (1) taking all action necessary to allow the respective companies’ stockholders to vote on proposals relating to the Merger, (2) non-solicitation of alternative acquisition proposals, (3) the conduct of their respective businesses during the period between the date of signing the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger, and (4) Adamis filing with the SEC after the closing of the Merger a registration statement or prospectus supplement covering the resale of shares of Adamis Common Stock that will be issued or issuable in connection with the Merger (the “Registration Statement”). The Merger Agreement provides that Adamis will pay certain actual, out-of-pocket transaction expenses incurred by DMK in connection with the transaction.
 The Merger Agreement may be terminated by either party under certain circumstances, including, among others: (i) if the Merger has not been completed by June 30, 2023; (ii) if a court or other governmental entity has issued a final and non-appealable order prohibiting the closing; (iii) if the company’s or DMK’s stockholders fail to approve the proposals required to complete the transaction; (iv) upon a material uncured breach by the other party that would result in a failure of the conditions to the closing; or (v) upon the occurrence of certain other triggering events as defined in the Merger Agreement.
 Following the closing of the Merger, the company’s executive officers are expected to include officers from the company and DMK. Ebrahim (Eboo) Versi, M.D., Ph.D., the co-founder and chief executive officer of DMK, is expected to become chief executive officer of the company; David J. Marguglio, the current chief executive officer and President of Adamis, is expected to continue as President of the company; and David C. Benedicto is expected to continue as the chief financial officer of the company.
 The Merger Agreement provides that the board of directors of the company after completion of the Merger will consist of two directors designated by DMK, and three directors designated by the company which are expected to be three of the current Adamis independent directors. Immediately after the closing of the Merger, it is expected that the Board will be comprised of Howard C. Birndorf, Meera J. Desai, Ph.D. and Vickie Reed, who are currently serving as independent directors of the company, as well as Dr. Versi and Jannine Versi, as the designees of DMK, with Dr. Versi serving as Chair of the Board.
 The transaction was approved by the boards of directors of both companies. Subject to a number of potential uncertainties, including without limitation the preparation and filing of a preliminary and definitive proxy statement with the SEC, the approval of DMK’s and Adamis’ respective stockholders of proposals relating to the Merger transaction, and the satisfaction of other closing conditions, Adamis anticipates that the transaction will close during the second quarter of 2023. However there can be no assurances that the Merger transaction will be completed or concerning the timing of any such closing.
 Support Agreement
 Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the principal stockholder of DMK (solely in its capacity as a DMK stockholder), holding in excess of approximately 95% of the currently outstanding shares of DMK capital stock, has entered into a support agreement with Adamis, DMK, and Merger Sub to vote all of the shares of DMK capital stock held by the stockholder in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement and against any alternative acquisition proposals (the “Support Agreement”).
Other
 The Merger Agreement and form of Support Agreement are attached as exhibits to the company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 27, 2023. The foregoing descriptions of these documents do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement and the Support Agreement, which are incorporated herein by reference. The Merger Agreement was attached as an exhibit to such Form 8-K to provide investors and securityholders with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about Adamis or DMK or to modify or supplement any factual disclosures about the company in its public reports filed with the SEC. The assertions embodied in the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement were made solely for the purpose of the Merger Agreement and solely for the benefit of the parties thereto in connection with the negotiated terms of the Merger Agreement.  Moreover, certain representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement were made as of a specified date, may have been made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement, and may be subject to contractual standards of materiality different from what might be viewed as material to the company’s stockholders. Accordingly, the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement should not be relied on by any persons as characterizations of the actual state of facts and circumstances of the company or DMK at the time they were made and should be considered in conjunction with the entirety of the factual disclosure about the company in the company’s public reports filed with the SEC. Information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the company’s public disclosures. The Merger Agreement should not be read alone, but should instead be read in conjunction with other information regarding the company. 
      Anaphylaxis; SYMJEPI; Epinephrine Injection Pre-Filled Single Dose Syringe        The American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology, or AAAAI, defines anaphylaxis as a serious life-threatening allergic reaction. The most common anaphylactic reactions are to foods, insect stings, medications and latex. According to information published by AAAAI reporting on findings from a 2009-2010 study, up to 8% of U.S. children under the age of 18 had a food allergy, and approximately 38% of those with a food allergy had a history of severe reactions. Anaphylaxis requires immediate medical treatment, with epinephrine as the first course of treatment to open airways and maintain blood pressure.

     We estimate that sales of prescription epinephrine products in 2022 were more than approximately $1.75 billion in 2022, based on assumptions and estimates using industry data. While we cannot provide any assurances concerning any possible future rates of annual growth or whether annual prescription sales will decline or grow, we believe that the epinephrine market has the potential to grow in the future, based in part on the prevalence of medical conditions, such as anaphylaxis, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases (asthma), and the increased awareness about the treatment options for the management of these diseases. The market for prescription epinephrine products is competitive, and a number of factors have resulted in, and could continue to result in, downward pressure on the pricing of, and revenues from sales of, our SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection 0.3mg and 0.15mg prescription epinephrine products. Our SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection 0.15mg and 0.3mg products allow users to administer a pre-measured epinephrine dose quickly with a device that we believe, based on human factors studies, to be intuitive to use. 
      On June 15, 2017, the FDA approved our SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection 0.3mg product for the emergency treatment of allergic reactions (Type I) including anaphylaxis. SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection 0.3mg is intended to deliver a dose of epinephrine, which is used for emergency, immediate administration in acute anaphylactic reactions to insect stings or bites, allergic reaction to certain foods, drugs and other allergens, as well as idiopathic or exercise-induced anaphylaxis for patients weighing 66 pounds or more. On September 27, 2018, the FDA approved our lower dose SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection 0.15mg product, for the emergency treatment of allergic reactions (Type I) including anaphylaxis in patients weighing 33 to 66 pounds. Our SYMJEPI injection products were fully launched in July 2019 by our then-commercialization partner Sandoz Inc. Our SYMJEPI products are currently marketed and sold by USWM, LLC, or USWM or US WorldMeds, with which we entered into an exclusive distribution and commercialization agreement, or the USWM Agreement, in May 2020 for the United States commercial rights for the SYMJEPI products, as well as for our ZIMHI product.
     On March 21, 2022, we announced a voluntary recall of four lots of SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection 0.15 mg (0.15 mg/0.3 mL) and 0.3 mg (0.3 mg/0.3 mL) Pre-Filled Single-Dose Syringes to the consumer level. The four lots were recalled due to the potential clogging of the needle preventing the dispensing of epinephrine. The recall was conducted with the knowledge of the FDA and USWM handled the entire recall process for the company, with company oversight. As of the date of this Report, neither USWM nor we have received, or are aware of, any adverse events related to this recall.
     SYMJEPI is manufactured and tested for us by Catalent Belgium S.A. For the manufacture of SYMJEPI, the company utilizes “Ready-to-Fill,” or RTF, syringes that consist of a pre-assembled glass syringe barrel with a staked-in stainless steel needle. On March 21, 2022, we announced a voluntary recall of four lots of SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection 0.15 mg (0.15 mg/0.3 mL) and 0.3 mg (0.3 mg/0.3 mL) Pre-Filled Single-Dose Syringes to the consumer level. The four lots were recalled due to the potential clogging of the needle preventing the dispensing of epinephrine. The recall was conducted with the knowledge of the FDA and USWM handled the entire recall process for the company, with company oversight. As of the date of this Report, neither USWM nor we have received, or are aware of, any adverse events related to this recall. SYMJEPI is manufactured and tested for us by Catalent Belgium S.A. For the manufacture of SYMJEPI, the company utilizes “Ready-to-Fill,” or RTF, syringes that consist of a pre-assembled glass syringe barrel with a staked-in stainless steel needle. During routine inspection of epinephrine pre-filled syringe batches, a small number of syringes with clogged needles were identified. An initial investigation suggested a syringe component issue as the likely cause of the observed needle clogging. Catalent’s investigation determined the steel used in a stainless steel needle batch as the root cause for the clogged syringes observed. The company and the manufacturer have developed corrective and preventive actions. New RTF syringes, which used a different batch of steel for their needles, were sourced and Catalent has resumed manufacturing of SYMJEPI at its Belgium facility. However, we have not reviewed data that would permit us to release this latest batch. While we are committed to returning SYMJEPI to the market, as of the date of this Report we believe it is unlikely that SYMJEPI will be relaunched and commercially available during the first half of 2023. The company may be able to be reimbursed by certain third parties for some of the costs of the recall under the terms of its manufacturing agreements, but there are no assurances regarding the amount or the timing of any such recovery. On February 8, 2023, we received notice from the FDA that the FDA considers the voluntary recall of our SYMJEPI products to be terminated.
     Opioid Overdose        ZIMHI (naloxone Injection)
     Naloxone is an opioid antagonist used to treat narcotic overdoses. Naloxone, which is generally considered the drug of choice for immediate administration for opioid overdose, blocks or reverses the effects of the opioid, including extreme drowsiness, slowed breathing, or loss of consciousness. Common opioids include morphine, heroin, tramadol, oxycodone, hydrocodone and fentanyl. 
      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated in that in 2020 more than 932,000 people have died since 1999. Additional statistics published by the CDC, report that drug overdoses resulted in approximately 107,764 deaths in the United States during the 12-month period ending March 2022, which was an 11% increase over the prior 12-month period.  Overdose deaths involving opioids (including both prescription and synthetic) are now the leading cause of death for Americans under age 50, with more powerful synthetic opioids, like fentanyl and its analogues, responsible for the largest number of those deaths. In June 2021, the National Institute on Drug Abuse; National Institutes of Health; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, published the policy brief, “Naloxone for Opioid Overdose: Life-Saving Science”, which reported that statistical modeling suggests that high rates of naloxone distribution among laypersons and emergency personnel could avert 21 percent of opioid deaths. The brief also stated that overdoses involving highly potent synthetic opioids such as fentanyl or large quantities of opioids may require multiple doses of naloxone. And, if respiratory function does not improve, naloxone doses may be repeated every two to three hours. 
     On December 31, 2018, we filed an NDA with the FDA relating to our higher dose naloxone injection product, ZIMHI, for the treatment of opioid overdose.  Following the receipt of two Complete Response Letters, or CRLs, from the FDA regarding our NDA for ZIMHI and our resubmissions of the NDA, on October 18, 2021, we announced that the FDA had approved ZIMHI for the treatment of opioid overdose. On March 31, 2022, our commercial partner USWM and the company issued a press release announcing the commercial launch of ZIMHI. 
     Tempol
     On June 12, 2020, we entered into a license agreement with a third party, or the Licensor, to license rights under certain patents, patent applications and related know-how of Licensor relating to Tempol, an investigational drug. The exclusive license included the worldwide use under the licensed patent rights and related rights for the fields of COVID-19 infection, as well as certain other indications. Tempol is a redox cycling nitroxide that promotes the metabolism of many reactive oxygen species and improves nitric oxide bioavailability. It has been studied extensively in animal models of oxidative stress and inflammation. Overall, Tempol acts as both a super-oxide dismutase mimetic and also has demonstrated anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant activity and antiviral activity. Inflammation and oxidative stress occur in various disease states including COVID-19.  Tempol has been shown to have antiviral activity against the virus that causes COVID-19 in-vitro. 
       6
 
      In January 2021, we submitted an IND to the FDA for the investigational use and proposed Phase 2/3 clinical trial of Tempol for the treatment of COVID-19, with the goal of the study to examine the safety and activity of Tempol in COVID-19 patients early in the infection. In addition to safety, the study examined markers of inflammation and the rate of hospitalization for patients taking Tempol versus placebo early in COVID-19 infection.   We commenced Phase 2/3 clinical trial start-up activities to examine the safety and efficacy of Tempol in COVID-19 patients early in the infection and on September 2, 2021, we announced the initiation of patient dosing in the trial. The Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, overseeing the Phase 2/3 clinical trial, which is composed of infectious disease experts that oversee and review the safety and efficacy of the trial, met in March and June 2022 to evaluate interim clinical and safety data and, following its evaluation, recommended that the study continue as planned. During the trial and interim review process, the company did not have access to unblinded trial data and did not have access to unblinded data until the final study data was compiled and reviewed. On September 21, 2022, we announced that the DSMB’s third interim analysis of the Phase 2/3 clinical trial, which was the first interim review where the DSMB evaluated the primary efficacy endpoint, determined that the trial did not achieve its primary endpoint, as measured by comparing the rate of sustained clinical resolution of symptoms of COVID-19 at day 14 of Tempol versus placebo, and recommended that the study be halted early due to lack of efficacy. Based on the recommendation from the DSMB, we have halted the trial and have stopped further development of Tempol.
     On October 27, 2022, we received a communication from the Licensor asserting that the license agreement between the Licensor and us relating to Tempol has terminated by virtue of alleged noncompliance by us with certain financial covenants contained in the agreement. We dispute, and do not agree, that the agreement has terminated. We are also evaluating potential claims against the Licensor including possible breach of its obligations under the agreement, and we intend to vigorously defend our rights relating to the agreement.  In any event, we do not believe that the agreement or any termination of the agreement is material to the Company’s current or presently anticipated future business, financial conditions or results of operations. 
     US Compounding, Inc.
     Our US Compounding Inc. subsidiary, or USC, which we acquired in April 2016 and which was registered as a human drug compounding outsourcing facility under Section 503B of the FDCA and the U.S. Drug Quality and Security Act, or DQSA, provided prescription compounded medications, including compounded sterile preparations and nonsterile compounds, to patients, physician clinics, hospitals, surgery centers and other clients throughout most of the United States. 
     On July 30, 2021, the company and our USC subsidiary entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, or the USC Agreement, effective as of July 30, 2021, or the Effective Date, with Fagron Compounding Services, LLC d/b/a Fagron Sterile Services (the “Purchaser”), providing for the sale and transfer by USC and the purchase by the Purchaser, effective as of the Effective Date, of certain assets of USC related to its human compounding pharmaceutical business, or the Business, including certain customer information and information on products sold to such customers by USC, together, the “Book of Business,” including related formulations, know-how, and expertise regarding the compounding of pharmaceutical preparations, clinical support knowledge and other data and certain other information relating to the customers and products, collectively referred to as the “Assets.”  Purchaser could use the Book of Business, including to secure customers for its products and services. The Purchaser did not assume any liabilities of USC, and the transaction did not include the sale or transfer of any USC equipment, buildings or real property, or other USC assets. The Purchaser made monthly payments to us based on formulas related to the amounts actually collected by the Purchaser or its affiliates for sales of products or services made to certain customers included in the Book of Business during the 12-month period following the Effective Date, or the “Payment Term.” As of December 31, 2022, the total amount received in connection with this purchase agreement was approximately $5.5 million. At December 31, 2022, the remaining receivable from Fagron was approximately $31,000. In connection with the transaction, the company accrued a $700,000 liability for a transaction fee payable to a financial advisor as of December 31, 2021, which was paid in 2022.
     In light of a number of factors including the sale of assets to the Purchaser pursuant to the USC Agreement, in August 2021 the Board approved a restructuring process of winding down the remaining operations and business of USC and selling, transferring or disposing of the remaining assets of USC.  Effective October 31, 2021, USC surrendered its Arkansas retail pharmacy permit and wholesaler/outsourcer permit and is no longer selling products or engaged in active business activities.  As of December 31, 2022, the remaining USC assets to be sold include additional equipment, real property, and a building. The winding down included, without limitation, the termination of USC’s veterinary business and USC sales to veterinary customers; the termination of employment of all employees engaged in the USC business (except as determined to be necessary or appropriate in connection with resolving matters relating to the winding down of USC’s business), and providing such notices and making such payments as the officers of the company determine are necessary or appropriate; the sale or other disposition from time to time of the remaining equipment, real property, buildings and tangible and intangible assets relating to USC’s business that are unrelated to the USC Agreement; the termination, assignment or other resolution of agreements with third parties relating to the USC business; making regulatory filings and taking appropriate actions with federal and state regulatory authorities in connection with the winding down and winding up of USC’s business; and taking such other actions as the officers of the company or USC (as appropriate) determine are necessary or appropriate in connection with the winding down and winding up of the remaining business, operations and assets of USC. 
    In connection with the winding down of the USC business, we incurred significant expenses and made a number of payments.  The substantial majority of cash payments related to personnel-related restructuring charges, including without limitation costs associated with providing termination payments to USC employees, employee salaries and incentive payments during a transition period after the effective date of the sale of the Assets pursuant to the USC Agreement, severance or other termination benefits or payments in connection with workforce reduction and termination of employment, and payments pursuant to retention agreements or incentive agreements with certain employees, were made during the third and fourth quarters of 2021 and were approximately $1.6 million.  In addition, as part of the winding down of USC’s business, we have incurred other costs.  We also expect to incur commissions and other costs associated with the sale or other disposition of certain USC tangible assets such as building, property and certain equipment. As of December 31, 2022, the company has received approximately $318,000 in cash related to the disposition of USC assets held for sale.
        7
 
     As a result of the transactions contemplated by the USC Agreement and the restructuring activities described above, the company’s financial results for the third and fourth quarters of 2021 include approximately $8.6 million for the impairment charges of inventory, fixed assets, intangibles, goodwill and right of use assets. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company further impaired USC assets for sale by approximately $0.2 million to reduce the net book value of remaining unsold equipment to $0 as the sale of the remaining equipment is not certain. No further impairment has been taken on the USC building as its recent appraisal supports its recorded net book value and the property is actively being marketed at the appraised value. While interest has been expressed for the property, as of the date of this Report, the company has not received a definitive offer to purchase the property. The impairment charges that the company incurred and expects to incur in connection with the matters described above are subject to a number of assumptions, and the actual amount of impairment charges may differ materially from those estimated by the company. In addition, the company may determine in the future that additional impairments of assets are appropriate in connection with the matters described above.
     Clinical Supplies and Manufacturing 
     We have no in-house manufacturing or distribution capabilities and have no current plans to establish manufacturing facilities for significant clinical or commercial production.  We rely on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture our products and make the material used to support the development of product candidates that we may determine to develop.  Our third-party manufacturers are subject to extensive governmental regulations. The FDA mandates that drugs be manufactured, packaged and labeled in conformity with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, regulations. In complying with cGMP regulations, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in production, record keeping and quality control to ensure that their services and products meet applicable specifications and other requirements.  We intend to continue to outsource the manufacture and distribution of our products for the foreseeable future, and we believe this manufacturing strategy will enable us to direct our financial resources to development of products without devoting the resources and capital required to build cGMP compliant manufacturing facilities.  Our SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection 0.3mg and 0.15mg products are manufactured by a third-party manufacturer, Catalent Belgium SA/NV, utilizing materials to complete the manufacturing process obtained from various companies and suppliers.  Our ZIMHI (naloxone) Injection 5 mg product is also manufactured by a third-party manufacturer, Siegfried, Irvine, USA, utilizing materials to complete the manufacturing process obtained from various companies and suppliers. The assembly and final packaging of all our products are implemented by a third-party entity, Phillips-Medisize, LLC. There are potential sources of supply other than our existing suppliers, although new suppliers would be required to qualify under applicable regulatory requirements. 
     Sales and Marketing         Our SYMJEPI (epinephrine) products were initially marketed and sold in the U.S. markets by Sandoz pursuant to our commercialization agreement with Sandoz.  Following termination of the Sandoz Agreement in 2020, our SYMJEPI products and our ZIMHI product are marketed and sold in the U.S. markets by USWM pursuant to our USWM Agreement.  
     Customers and Distribution            Our SYMJEPI (epinephrine) 0.15 mg and 0.3 mg Injection products and our ZIMHI product are distributed in the U.S. markets by our commercialization partner USWM pursuant to the USWM Agreement.  The FDA approved ZIMHI for marketing in October 2021, and on March 31, 2022, our commercialization partner USWM and we issued a press release announcing the commercial launch of ZIMHI. Under the terms of the USWM Agreement, USWM is the exclusive distributor of SYMJEPI in the United States and related territories, or Territory, and USWM has an exclusive license under our patent and other intellectual property rights and know-how to market, sell, and otherwise commercialize and distribute the products in the Territory, in partial consideration of an initial payment of $1,000,000 by USWM and potential additional regulatory and commercial based milestone payments. There can be no assurances that any of these milestones will be met or that any milestone payments will be paid to us. We retain rights to the intellectual property subject to the USWM Agreement and to commercialize both products outside of the Territory. In addition, we may continue to use the licensed intellectual property (excluding certain of the licensed trademarks) to develop and commercialize other products (with certain exceptions), including products that utilize our Symject™ syringe product platform.
     Pursuant to our agreement with USWM, we are responsible for supplying the SYMJEPI and ZIMHI products to USWM at a supply price for quantities of products ordered.  The USWM Agreement provides that, after deducting the supply price and subject to certain other deductions and adjustments, including an allocation for USWM sales and distribution expenses from net sales of the products, USWM will pay to us 50% of the net profit from net sales, as each such term is defined in the USWM Agreement, of the product in the Territory to third parties, determined on a quarterly basis. We will be the supplier of the products to USWM, and USWM will order and pay us a supply price for quantities of products ordered. The agreement does not include minimum payments to us by USWM, minimum requirements for sales of product by USWM or, with certain exceptions, minimum purchase commitments by USWM. 
     Competition         The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are extremely competitive. Our potential competitors in the field are many in number and include major pharmaceutical and specialized biotechnology companies. Many of our potential competitors have significantly more financial, technical and other resources than we do, which may give them a competitive advantage. In addition, they may have substantially more experience in effecting strategic combinations, in-licensing technology, developing drugs, obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing products. We cannot give any assurances that we can compete effectively with these other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Our potential competitors in these markets may succeed in developing products that could render our products and those of our collaborators obsolete or non-competitive. In addition, many of our competitors have significantly greater experience than we do in the fields in which we compete.  
     Our products and product candidates, if developed, approved and launched, will compete with numerous prescription and non-prescription over-the-counter products targeting similar conditions, as well as prescription generic products. In addition, a number of large pharmaceuticals companies produce similar pharmaceutical products for similar indications. Moreover, certain products that previously have been available by prescription only have been or could in the future be approved by the FDA for sale over-the-counter without a prescription at a lower price than competing prescription products, which could adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market a competing prescription product.

     The SYMJEPI (epinephrine) Injection 0.3mg and 0.15mg products compete against other self-administered epinephrine products, including EpiPen, EpiPen Jr., Auvi-Q and Adrenaclick. There has been market and regulatory focus in recent years on the prices to consumers of self-administered epinephrine products, which have exerted downward pressure on the pricing of such products. The company that markets EpiPen, introduced an authorized generic version of the auto-injector product at a lower price than the EpiPen.  Additionally, in late 2018 a generic, or A/B rated, competitor to EpiPen was approved and launched. Other competing products have been introduced or prices on existing competing products have been reduced, and if additional competing products are introduced in the future, including additional generic versions of one or more existing spring-loaded auto-injector devices, at lower prices than the current market leading products, the competitive success of our SYMJEPI products could be adversely affected. The competitive success of our products could also be adversely affected by changes in the willingness of insurance companies and other third-party payors to cover or reimburse some or all of the costs to consumers of our products.  Our ZIMHI high dose naloxone injection product, for opioid overdose, competes with other products in the markets for opioid overdose. 
     Intellectual Property 
     Our success will depend in part on our ability to:  
    
● | obtain and maintain international and domestic patents and other legal protections for the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | prosecute and defend our patents; 
● | preserve our trade secrets; and 
● | operate without infringing on the patents and proprietary rights of other parties. 

 
 We intend to continue to seek appropriate patent protection for product candidates in our research and development programs where applicable and their uses by filing patent applications in the United States and other selected countries.  We intend for these patent applications to cover, where possible, claims for composition of matter, medical uses, processes for preparation and formulations. As of December 31, 2022, the company had: (i) 28 issued patents in the United States and 7 pending United States patent applications; (ii) 121 issued and 30 pending foreign patent applications, three of which have been allowed, relating to our Symject™ injection device, as well as certain other product candidates and technologies that we are not pursuing, among other things. The issued patents and allowed patents applications are expected to expire between 2023 and 2041, not taking into account any potential patent-term extensions that may be available in the future.
     In addition, we licensed certain rights under certain patents, patent applications and related know-how of the Licensor relating to Tempol pursuant to our license agreement with the Licensor.  As disclosed elsewhere in this Report, we have halted all development work relating to Tempol. 
          Although we believe that our rights under patents and patent applications provide a competitive advantage, the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. We may not be able to develop patentable products or processes, and may not be able to obtain patents from pending applications. Even if patent claims are allowed, the claims may not issue, or in the event of issuance, may not be sufficient to protect the technology owned by or licensed to us. It is possible that any patents or patent rights that we obtain or license may be circumvented, challenged or invalidated by our competitors. 
     We also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position, especially when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or can be obtained. We seek protection of these trade secrets, proprietary know-how and any continuing innovation, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. However, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for, or adequate remedies to protect, our technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of information. Furthermore, our trade secrets may otherwise become known to, or be independently developed by, our competitors.  
     Government Regulation         The marketing of pharmaceutical products in the United States is subject to extensive government regulation. Likewise, if we seek to market and distribute any such products abroad, they would also be subject to extensive foreign government regulation. 
      In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products. FDA regulations govern the testing, manufacturing, marketing, advertising, promotion, labeling, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products, and generally require a rigorous process for the approval of new drugs. We also may be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing clinical trials and drug product sales if products are tested or marketed abroad. The approval process outside the United States varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the time required may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.  
     Regulation in the United States          Seeking and obtaining FDA approval to market a drug requires substantial time, effort and money. Our product candidates that require marketing approval by the FDA will be regulated as drugs. In the United States, drugs are subject to regulation under the FDCA. The statute and related regulations govern, among other things, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising, and other promotional practices. The FDA approval process for new drugs generally includes, without limitation:  
    
● | preclinical studies; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for clinical trials; 
● | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish safety and efficacy of the product; 
● | review of a New Drug Application, or NDA; and 
● | inspection of the facilities used in the manufacturing of the drug to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations.

       Failure to comply with FDA and other governmental regulations at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval can result in fines, unanticipated compliance expenditures, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, suspension of the FDA’s review of NDAs injunctions and criminal prosecution. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on us.

     Preclinical Trials        Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the product, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and effectiveness of the product. Most of these studies must be performed according to FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, requirements, a system of management controls for laboratories and research organizations to ensure the consistency and reliability of results. The results of the preclinical studies and existing clinical and/or human use data (if applicable), together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which we are required to file before we can commence any clinical trials for our product candidates in the United States. Clinical trials may begin 30 days after an IND is received, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trials. If concerns or questions are raised, an IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. We cannot assure you that submission of any additional IND for any of our preclinical product candidates will result in authorization to commence clinical trials.
     Human Clinical Trials under an IND        Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate that is the subject of the trial to volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each institution at which the study will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution arising from the conduct of the proposed clinical trial. Also, clinical trials must be performed according to standards, commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements, which are enumerated in FDA regulations and guidance documents. 
     Clinical trials typically are conducted in sequential phases: Phases 1, 2 and 3. The phases may overlap. The FDA may require that we suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including if the FDA makes a finding that the subjects participating in the trial are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. In Phase 1 clinical trials, a drug is usually tested on a limited number of healthy subjects to determine safety, existence of adverse effects, proper dosage, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and other drug effects. In Phase 2 clinical trials, a drug is usually tested on a limited patient population to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the drug for specific, targeted indications, determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. In Phase 3 clinical trials, a drug is usually tested on a larger patient population to determine efficacy and to further determine safety, usually at multiple clinical sites. We cannot assure you that any of our current or future clinical trials will result in approval to market additional products.   
     U.S. Review and Approval Processes        An NDA must include comprehensive and complete descriptions of the preclinical testing, clinical trials and the chemical, manufacturing and control requirements of a drug that enable the FDA to determine the drug’s or biologic’s safety and efficacy. An NDA must be accompanied by payment of a user fee unless a waiver or exemption applies, and must be submitted, filed and approved by the FDA before any drug product that we may successfully develop and that requires marketing approval by the FDA can be marketed commercially in the United States.  
     Once the FDA receives an NDA, it has 60 days to review the application to determine if it is substantially complete and the data is readable, before it accepts the NDA for filing. The FDA can refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable.  Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submission to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity.
     Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA agrees to specific goals for NDA review time through a two-tiered classification system, Priority Review and Standard Review. A Priority Review designation is given to drugs that are intended to treat serious conditions, and would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness if approved.  For a Priority Review application, the FDA aims to complete the initial review cycle for New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, within six months of the 60 day filing date, and for non-NMEs within six months of the date of receipt. Standard Review applies to all applications that are not eligible for Priority Review. The FDA aims to complete Standard Review NDAs for NMEs within ten months of the 60 day filing date, and for non-NMEs within ten months of the date of receipt. Such dates are often referred to as the PDUFA dates. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA dates for either Standard Reviews or Priority Reviews of NDAs. The review process and the PDUFA date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA date. In addition, the FDA’s review processes can extend beyond, and in some cases significantly beyond, anticipated completion dates due to FDA requests for additional information or clarification, issuance of a complete response letter, difficulties scheduling an advisory committee meeting, negotiations regarding any required risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, FDA workload issues or other reasons.
     The FDA also has established programs to expedite the development and review of drugs intended to treat serious conditions.  For example, the fast track designation is designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and address an unmet medical need. The FDA generally attempts to facilitate early and frequent meetings with sponsors of fast track drugs.  The breakthrough therapy designation is granted to drugs intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over available therapies. In addition to early and frequent meetings between the sponsor and FDA, benefits of breakthrough designation include intensive guidance on efficient drug development from FDA, as well as organizational commitment from FDA.  Finally, accelerated approval may be granted for a drug that treats a serious or life-threatening condition and provides a meaningful therapeutic advantage over available treatments, and the drug demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit or a clinical endpoint other than irreversible morbidity or mortality. 
     The amount of time taken for the approval process is a function of a number of variables, including whether the product has received priority review or has received another expedited program designation, the quality of the submission and studies presented, the potential contribution that the compound will make in improving the treatment of the disease in question, and the workload at the FDA. The FDA may, during its review of an NDA, ask for additional test data or the conducting of additional clinical trials.

  10
 
     Prior to regulatory approval, the FDA may elect to obtain advice from outside experts regarding scientific issues and/or marketing applications under FDA review. These outside experts are convened through the FDA’s Advisory Committee process. An Advisory Committee will report to the FDA and make recommendations. Views of the Advisory Committee may differ from those of the FDA, and the FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an Advisory Committee.   
     Before approving an NDA, the FDA generally will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the NDA unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The facilities, procedures and operations for any of our contract manufacturers must be determined to be adequate by the FDA before product approval. Foreign manufacturing facilities are also subject to periodic FDA inspections or inspections by foreign regulatory authorities. Vendors that may supply us with finished products or components used to manufacture, package and label products are also subject to similar regulations and periodic inspections. Among other things, the FDA may withhold approval of NDAs or other product applications if deficiencies are found at any of these facilities.
     Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical studies were conducted in compliance with GCP requirements. If the FDA determines that the processes and procedures used are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional clinical testing or information before an NDA can be approved. The FDA may also inspect one or more of the preclinical toxicology research sites to assure that the preclinical studies were conducted in compliance with GLP requirements. If the FDA determines that the studies were not performed in compliance with applicable GLP rules and regulations, the FDA may request additional preclinical testing or information before an NDA can be approved.
     The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA. The complete response letter describes the specific deficiencies in the submission identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or more significant, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 
     If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. The FDA also may impose restrictions on the use of the product, which may be difficult and expensive to administer.  Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling.  Moreover, the FDA may require prior approval of promotional materials. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS.  A REMS uses risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks.  REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professional, and elements to assure safe use.
     In addition, the FDA may require post marketing studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess drug safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. After approval, certain changes to the approved drug or biologic, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Depending on the nature of the change proposed, an NDA supplement must be filed and approved before the change may be implemented. For many proposed post-approval changes to an NDA, the FDA review period can be lengthy and is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
     Post-approval requirements
     Following receipt of regulatory approval, any products that we market continue to be subject to extensive regulation including, among other things, record-keeping requirements; reporting of adverse experiences with the product; providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information; product storage, sampling and distribution requirements; complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements; and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling, known as “off-label” use, and requirements relating to industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. These regulations impact many aspects of our operations, including the manufacture, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, distribution, advertising, promotion and record keeping related to the products. The FDA also frequently requires post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products or places conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of these products. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, disgorgement of money, civil injunctions, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
     In addition, as part of the sales and marketing process, pharmaceutical companies frequently provide samples of approved drugs to physicians. This practice is regulated by the FDA and other governmental authorities, including, in particular, requirements concerning record keeping and control procedures. Any failure to comply with the regulations may result in significant criminal and civil penalties as well as damage to our credibility in the marketplace.  
     The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including through standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. While physicians may choose to prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and for uses that differ from those tested in clinical studies and approved by the regulatory authorities, our ability to promote the products is limited to those indications that are specifically approved by the FDA. These “off-label” uses are not unusual across certain medical specialties and may constitute an appropriate treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. Federal regulatory authorities in the U.S. generally do not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. Federal regulatory authorities do, however, restrict communications by pharmaceutical companies on the subject of off-label use. If our promotional activities fail to comply with these regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, these authorities. In addition, our failure to follow FDA rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising may cause the FDA to delay its approval, and could result in other consequences such as recalls, fines, disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions, civil or criminal prosecution or penalties, or other possible legal or regulatory actions, such as warning letters, seizure of product, mandated corrective advertising or communications with healthcare professionals, or criminal penalties or other negative consequences, including adverse publicity. Any of these consequences could harm our business.
       11
 
     We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Our collaborators may also utilize third-parties for some or all of a product we are developing with such collaborator. Manufacturers are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
     Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications         New drug products may obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to a Section 505(b)(1) NDA filing or a 505(b)(2) NDA filing.  Whereas a 505(b)(1) NDA requires that the applicant must support its application with its own information or information to which it has a right of reference, a Section 505(b)(2) NDA enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy of an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon the FDA’s findings with respect to certain pre-clinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or provide other data to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
     In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to submit to the FDA information about each patent that claims the applicant’s drug or a method of using the drug, and for which a claim of patent infringement reasonably could be asserted. Upon approval of a drug, information about each of those patents is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book.
     To the extent that a Section 505(b)(2) NDA relies on published literature relating to a previously approved drug product or the FDA’s prior findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved drug product, where the underlying studies were not conducted by or for the applicant and the applicant lacks a right of reference or use to the underlying data, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant must submit in its Section 505(b)(2) application a patent certification or statement with respect to any patents that are subject to the Orange Book listing requirement in connection with the previously approved product on which the applicant’s application relies. Specifically, the applicant must certify for each such patent that, in relevant part, (1) the required patent information has not been filed; (2) the patent has expired; (3) the patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is not sought until after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the proposed new product. Alternatively, with respect to a method of use patent, the applicant may submit a statement that the patent does not claim a use for which the applicant is seeking approval. A certification that the new product will not infringe the previously approved product’s listed patent or that such patent is invalid or unenforceable is known as a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents through a Paragraph IV certification or submit a statement that a method of use patent does not claim a use for which the applicant is seeking approval, the FDA will not approve the Section 505(b)(2) NDA application until all the listed patents for the previously approved product have expired. Further, the FDA will also not approve a Section 505(b)(2) NDA until any applicable non-patent exclusivity, such as, for example, five-year exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, three-year exclusivity for an approval based on new clinical trials, or pediatric exclusivity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product, has expired.
     If the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the owner of the referenced NDA for the previously approved product and relevant patent holders within 20 days after the FDA sends the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant notice that the Section 505(b)(2) NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement suit against the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. Under the FDCA, the filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of receipt of the notification regarding a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for 30 months beginning on the date the patent holder receives notice, unless, before the end of the 30-month period, a court determines that the patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed; a court enters a settlement order or consent decree stating that the patent is invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed; the patent owner or exclusive licensee consents to approval of the Section 505(b)(2) NDA; or the court enters an order of dismissal without a finding of infringement. Even if a patent infringement claim is not brought within the 45-day period, a patent infringement claim may be brought under traditional patent law, but it does not invoke the 30-month stay. Moreover, in cases where a Section 505(b)(2) application containing a Paragraph IV certification is submitted during the final year of a previously approved drug’s five-year exclusivity period and the patent holder brings suit within 45 days of notice of certification, the 30-month period is automatically extended to prevent approval of the Section 505(b)(2) application until the date that is seven and one-half years after approval of the previously approved reference product. The court also has the ability to shorten or lengthen either the 30 month or the seven and one-half year period if either party is found not to be reasonably cooperating in expediting the litigation.
       12
 
     Notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), over the last several years, some pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA’s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA changes its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2), or if the FDA’s interpretation is successfully challenged in court, this could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) NDA that we submit.
     Abbreviated New Drug Applications        In contrast to the kind of clinical trial and other data that is required for an NDA submitted pursuant to Section 505(b)(1) or Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, contains data that, when submitted to the FDA pursuant to Section 505(j) of the FDCA, provides for the review and ultimate approval of a product commonly referred to as a “generic equivalent” or a “generic” drug product. These kinds of drug applications are called “abbreviated” because ANDA applicants are generally not required to conduct or submit preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) data to establish safety and effectiveness of their product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Instead, a generic applicant must scientifically demonstrate that its product is bioequivalent, that is, that the product performs in the same manner as the listed drug. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug, among other requirements. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. 
     In seeking approval for a new drug through an NDA, applicants are required to submit to the FDA information about each patent that claims the applicant’s drug or a method of using the drug. Upon approval of a drug, information about each of those patents is then published in the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be referenced by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA. The ANDA applicant is required to submit to the FDA an appropriate certification or statement concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book, in a manner generally similar to the certification or statement that is required in connection with Section 505(b)(2) applications as described above. As with Section 505(b)(2) applications, if the applicant does not challenge the listed patents and has not submitted a statement that a method of use patent does not claim a use for which the applicant is seeking approval, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
     If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, then the procedures described above in connection with Section 505(b)(2) applications also apply, and the risks of the patent holder initiating a patent infringement lawsuit as described above also apply. The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. Federal law provides a period of five years following approval of a drug containing a new chemical entity, during which ANDAs for generic versions of those drugs cannot be submitted unless the submission contains a Paragraph IV certification to a listed patent, in which case the submission may be made four years following the original product approval. Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity following approval of a listed drug that does not contain a new chemical entity, but is approved, for example, in a new dosage form, route of administration or combination, or for a new use, the approval of which was supported by new clinical trials (other than bioavailability studies) that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant and were essential to approval of the application, during which FDA cannot grant effective approval of an ANDA referencing that listed drug for the conditions of approval supported by the new clinical trials. 
     Regulation Outside the United States         If we market our products in foreign countries, we also will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials, marketing approval, and commercial sales and distribution for pharmaceutical products. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product approval, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained before manufacturing or marketing the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time required for such approvals may differ substantially from that required for FDA approval. There is no assurance that any future FDA approval of any of our clinical trials or drugs will result in similar foreign approvals or vice versa.  

  13
 
     Additional Regulation 
     Third-Party Reimbursement         In the United States, physicians, hospitals and other healthcare providers that purchase pharmaceutical products generally rely on third- party payors, principally private health insurance plans, Medicare, or Medicaid, to reimburse the cost of the product and related procedure, with varying degrees of patient cost sharing. Even if a product is approved for marketing by the FDA, there is no assurance that third- party payors will cover the cost of the product and related medical procedures. If they do not, end-users of the product generally would not be eligible for any reimbursement of the cost, and our ability to successfully market any such product would be materially and adversely impacted. The level of reimbursement also varies significantly by payor and setting of care, and inadequate reimbursement also could materially and adversely impact our ability to successfully market our products. 
      Reimbursement systems vary significantly by country and, within some countries, by region, and coverage and reimbursement for our products must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. In many foreign markets, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government pricing control or other mechanisms, including health technology assessments, mandatory rebates, and reference pricing. In these markets, once marketing approval is received, establishing coverage and reimbursement could take significant additional time. The lack of satisfactory reimbursement or inadequate government pricing of any of our products would limit their widespread use and lower potential product revenues. 
     Fraud and Abuse Laws and Reporting Laws        In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws may restrict certain research and marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include federal and state anti-kickback and false claims laws. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for referring an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, or purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to various arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and other entities, including arrangements where any one purpose of the remuneration was a prohibited inducement under the Statute even if the primary purpose was compensation of legitimate services. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Regulations finalized by the Department of Health and Human Services have amended existing safe harbors or added new safe harbors, and certain of these regulations are subject to ongoing review.  Additionally, if a drug product is reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid, pricing and rebate programs must comply with, as applicable, the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, as amended, and other federal laws. Compliance with these fraud and abuse and reporting requirements requires significant resources. We could be required to devote significant additional financial resources and management attention if we ever become the focus of an investigation for failure to comply with these requirements.
      The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, including any claim submitted in violation of fraud and abuse and reporting requirements, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Claims that include items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute can constitute false or fraudulent claims under the False Claims Act. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may violate the False Claims Act. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or by a private individual acting as an informer or whistleblower in the name of the government, and violations can result in significant monetary penalties. The federal government has used the civil False Claims Act, and the threat of significant liability, in its investigations of healthcare providers, suppliers and drug and device manufacturers throughout the country for a wide variety of drug and device marketing and research practices, and has obtained large settlements. Numerous pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been pursued under this law, including for allegedly inflating drug prices used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. There is also a criminal False Claims Act, which prohibits making or presenting any false, fictitious or fraudulent claims to the government and authorizes penalties including imprisonment and fines for individuals and organizations. Many states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer’s products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines and imprisonment. Federal and state authorities may continue to devote substantial resources toward investigating healthcare providers’, suppliers’ and drug and device manufacturers’ compliance with these and other fraud and abuse and reporting requirements. 
      HIPAA        We may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, addresses the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information and, among other things, requires the use of standard transactions, imposes privacy and security standards and requires breach notification, by covered entities, which include many healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses. HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, such as independent contractors or agents of covered entities, that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. Material monetary penalties and other remedies can result from violation of these laws and regulations. In addition, many state laws also address the privacy and security of health information, and many of these laws differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. In addition, the European Union, or EU, has a separate data security and privacy legal framework, including the European General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which was adopted in 2018, which contains new provisions specifically directed at the processing of health information.  To the extent that we conduct clinical trials in the EU or otherwise expand our business operations to include operations in the EU, we would be subject to increased governmental regulation in the EU countries in which we might operate, including the GDPR.

     Healthcare Reform        The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, enacted in 2010, was intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. The law thus included changes that significantly impact the pharmaceutical industry. The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which is part of the ACA, and its implementing regulations impose federal reporting and disclosure requirements for pharmaceutical and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to covered recipients, including physicians, teaching hospitals, advanced-practice nurses and physician assistants. In addition, pharmaceutical and device manufacturers also are required to report certain investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. 
     The ACA also established: an annual nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program; and a new formula that increased the rebates that a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. In December 2017, portions of the ACA dealing with the individual mandate insurance requirement were effectively repealed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and other aspects of the ACA may be altered or repealed by future legislation. A court challenge to the validity of the ACA failed in June 2021, when the U.S. Supreme Court decided that the plaintiffs in the lawsuit did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the individual mandate provisions of the ACA. As of the date of this Report the ACA remains in effect. 
     In addition, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their commercial products, including several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation and regulation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and patient assistance programs, reduce the cost of drugs under federal and state healthcare programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. In August 2022, Congress enacted the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, which includes significant changes to potential Medicare drug product reimbursement, as well as manufacturer rebate and discount obligations.  It is unclear how the IRA will be implemented but will likely have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. The IRA and any changes at the federal or state level to drug pricing or reimbursement policies could affect our ability to successfully commercialize approved products. 
     Additionally, several states require pharmaceutical companies to report information to state agencies, including information relating to drug pricing, marketing and promotion expenses, and gifts and payments to individual health care providers in the states. Other states limit or prohibit certain marketing related activities. In addition, certain states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes. Additional states may consider similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties. If in the future some of our business activities were subject to challenge under one or more of such laws, an adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.
     Other Laws        We are also subject to other federal, state and local laws of general applicability, such as laws regulating working conditions, and various federal, state and local environmental protection laws and regulations, including laws such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal and state laws regarding, among other things, occupational safety, the use and handling of radioisotopes, environmental protection and hazardous substance control. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future. Our research and development activities may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals that cause cancer, volatile solvents, radioactive materials and biological materials that have the potential to transmit disease, and our operations may produce hazardous waste. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subjected to criminal sanctions and substantial financial liability or be required to suspend or modify our operations. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources.
      In addition, as an owner and operator of real property, we may also be subject to liability for environmental investigations and cleanups, including at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us, even if such contamination was not caused by us, as well as to claims for harm to health or property or for natural resource damages arising out of contamination or exposure to hazardous substances. Liability in many situations may be imposed not only without regard to fault, but may also be joint and several, so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the contamination or other damages, or even for the entire share. We may also be subject to similar liabilities and claims in connection with locations at which hazardous substances or wastes that we have generated have been stored, treated, otherwise managed or disposed. The costs of complying with, or other impact of, current or future environmental, health and safety requirements could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.   
     Outsourcing Facility Regulation        Our compounding business formerly conducted by USC was subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations, and administrative practices, including, among others: requirements relating to federal registration as an outsourcing facility; state and local licensure and registration requirements concerning the operation of outsourcing facilities; HIPAA; ACA and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010; statutes and regulations of the FDA and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA; and state laws and regulations promulgated by comparable state agencies concerning the preparation, sale, advertisement and promotion of drugs that were sold by USC. As described elsewhere in this Report, we have ceased the sale of compounding pharmaceutical formulations and are winding down the business of USC, but it is possible that issues could arise in the future relating to our previous activities or the activities of USC under such laws, which could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, see “Legal Proceedings” elsewhere in this Report for additional matters relating to our former compounding pharmaceutical formulation business. 
     Employees and Human Capital Resources         As of December 31, 2022, we had 11 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee, all located in the United States. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor or trade union, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.

      Our human capital management goals include, as applicable, identifying, attracting, retaining, and incentivizing our employees, directors and consultants. We seek to create a safe, supportive, and rewarding work environment and to align employees’ goals with our overall strategic direction.  Our equity and cash compensation and incentive plans are primarily intended to attract, retain and motivate personnel through compensation and equity-based and cash-based compensation awards, with a goal of increasing the success of our company.
     COVID-19.  As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented safety protocols to mitigate the risks of infection to our employees. Our COVID-19 pandemic preparedness and response was and is a focus.  Our pandemic response measures incorporate guidance issued by external health authorities and are designed with the goal of keeping workers at our facilities safe and healthy.
