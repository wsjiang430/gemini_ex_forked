Item 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
Ebix, Inc. (“Ebix”, the “Company,” “we” or “our”), a Delaware corporation, was founded in 1976 as Delphi Systems, Inc. In December 2003, the Company changed its name to Ebix, Inc. The Company is listed on the Nasdaq Global Market ("Nasdaq").
Ebix is a leading international supplier of on-demand infrastructure exchanges to the insurance, financial services, travel, and healthcare industries. In the insurance sector, the Company’s main focus is to develop and deploy a wide variety of insurance and reinsurance exchanges on an on-demand basis using software-as-a-service ("SaaS") enterprise solutions in the areas of customer relationship management ("CRM"), front-end and back-end systems, and outsourced administrative and risk compliance. The Company's products feature fully customizable and scalable on-demand software designed to streamline the way insurance and financial industry professionals manage distribution, marketing, sales, customer service, and accounting activities. With a "Phygital" strategy that combines physical distribution outlets in India and many Associations of Southeast Asian Nations ("ASEAN") countries to an Omni-channel online digital platform, the Company’s EbixCash Financial exchange portfolio of software and services encompasses domestic and international money remittance, foreign exchange ("Forex"), travel, pre-paid gift cards, utility payments, lending, and wealth management in India and other ASEAN markets.
The Company has its worldwide headquarters in Johns Creek, Georgia, and also has domestic and international operations spread across approximately 200 offices. The countries in which the Company has operating facilities and offices, include, among others, Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Indonesia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, the United Kingdom ("U.K."), the United Arab Emirates and the United States of America ("United States" or "U.S."). In these locations Ebix employs skilled technology and business professionals who provide products, services, support and consultancy services to thousands of customers in over 70 countries across six continents.
Ebix's goal is to be a leading facilitator of insurance and financial transactions in the world. The Company’s technology vision is to focus on the convergence of all insurance and financial exchange channels, processes and entities for seamless data flow. Ebix combines the newest technologies with its capabilities in consulting, systems design and integration, information technology ("IT") and business process outsourcing, applications software, and web and application hosting to meet the individual needs of organizations. 
The Company’s EbixCash Exchanges (“EbixCash”) division executes a "Phygital” strategy that combines over 650,000 physical distribution outlets in India and many ASEAN countries with an Omni-channel online digital platform. The Company’s EbixCash Financial exchange portfolio of software and services encompasses domestic and international money remittance, foreign exchange ("Forex"), travel, pre-paid gift cards, utility payments, lending and wealth management in India and other Southeast Asian markets. EbixCash’s Forex operations have emerged as a leader in India’s airport Forex business, with operations in 20 international airports, including Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai and Kolkata. EbixCash’s inward remittance business in India is the clear market leader due to its geographic depth and its affiliations with international money transmitters, such as Western Union, Moneygram and Ria. EbixCash, through its travel portfolio of Via and Mercury, is one of Southeast Asia’s leading travel exchanges, with over 500,000 agents and approximately 18,000 registered corporate clients. EbixCash's financial technologies business offers software solutions at the enterprise level for banks, asset and wealth management companies and trust companies within India, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The EbixCash's e-learning solutions are provided to schools throughout India via high quality 2-D and 3-D animation and multimedia learning. EbixCash's business process outsourcing services provide information technology and call center services to a variety of industries.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 92.3% of Ebix revenues came from EbixCash and Insurance Exchanges. International revenue accounted for 85.3% and 84.4% of the Company’s total revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Acquisition & Integration Strategy
While not entirely critical to our future profitability or liquidity, the Company views acquisitions as an integral part of its growth strategy, an efficient way to further expand its reach, and an effective utilization of the operating cash generated from the Company's business. We are strategic and selective when making acquisitions. We look to make complementary accretive 
acquisitions as and when the Company has sufficient liquidity, stable cash flows, and, if necessary, access to financing at attractive interest rates.
The Company seeks to acquire businesses that complement Ebix's existing products and services. Any acquisition made by Ebix typically will fall into one of two different categories: (i) the acquired company has products and/or services that are competitive to our existing products and services; or (ii) the acquired company's products and services are either a complement to or an extension of our existing products and services or our core business competencies.
In cases where an acquired company's products and services are competitive to our existing products and services, upon acquisition, the Company immediately strives towards the goal of providing a single product or service in the functional area with a common code base around the world, rather than having multiple products addressing the same need. In each case, the Company immediately works towards assimilating the best of breed functionality on a common architecture. The Company's goal remains to provide easy-to-use solutions for our customer base, while ensuring that any product or service integrates seamlessly with other existing or outside functionalities. Regardless of whether the acquired company's product/service is retired, or the existing Ebix product/service is retired, the Company is focused on maximizing operational efficiency for our business while creating cutting-edge products and services that make future product sales more robust and maintenance more efficient.
Once an acquisition is consummated, the infrastructure, human resources, sales, product management, development, and other common functions are integrated with our existing operations to ensure that efficiencies are maximized and redundancies eliminated. We generally do not maintain separate sales, development, product management, implementation or quality control functions following the closing of any acquisition. The Company integrates and, where appropriate, centralizes certain key functions, such as product development, information technology, marketing, sales, finance, administration, and quality assurance, immediately after an acquisition to ensure that the Company can maximize cost efficiencies. Simultaneously with the integration of any acquired company, the Company's resources and infrastructure are leveraged to work across multiple functions, products and services, making it neither practical nor feasible to precisely track and disclose separately the specific earnings impact from the business combinations we have executed after they have been acquired. Consequently, the concept of “acquisitive growth” versus “organic growth” becomes obscured given the dynamics and underlying operating principals of Ebix's acquisition, integration, and growth strategy. This tactic is a key part of our business strategy that facilitates high levels of efficiency, operating income margins and consistent end-to-end vision for our business. Our plan is to make niche acquisitions in the insurance, international financial exchange, e-learning, and healthcare sectors, integrate them seamlessly into the Company and make them efficient by implementing Ebix's standardized processes, with the goal of increasing operating profits and cash flows for the Company.
In many of the acquisitions made by the Company there are contingent consideration terms associated with the achievement of certain designated revenue targets for the acquired Company. This structure allows us to follow through with our integration strategy, while enabling the acquired company to be eligible for revenue-based contingent purchase consideration. Accordingly, we are able to maximize operational productivity while allowing the principals of the acquired company to maximize the potential economics from the sale process.
The Company's integration strategies are targeted at improving the efficiency of our business, centralizing key functions, exercising better control over our operations, and providing consistent technology and product vision across all functions, entities and products. This is a key part of our business philosophy designed to enable Ebix to operate at a high level of efficiency and facilitate a consistent end-to-end strategic vision for the industries we serve.

During the year ended December 31, 2021 the Company did not complete any business acquisitions.
Industry Overview
The insurance and financial services industries have initiatives to reduce paper-based processes and facilitate efficiencies of both the back-end and the consumer-end (front-end) sides of processes. This evolution has involved all industry constituents and is directly impacting the manner in which various products are distributed. Management believes that both industries will continue to experience significant change and increased efficiencies through online exchanges as reduced paper-based processes are becoming increasingly a norm across world markets.
Products and Services
The Company reports as a single operating segment. The Company’s revenues are derived from three product/service groups. Presented in the table below is the breakout of our revenue streams for each of those product/service groups for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020:

 | For the Year Ended

Insurance Exchanges | | 171,156 | | | 171,087 | | | 174,424

Totals | | $ | 1,050,146 | | | $ | 994,938 | | $ | 625,609

Information on the geographic dispersion of the Company’s revenues and long-lived assets is furnished in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, included in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K. See Item 1A (Risk Factors) for discussion of certain risks related to our foreign operations.
The Company’s product and service strategy focuses on: (a) expansion of connectivity between all entities via its EbixCash and Ebix Exchange family of products in the financial, Forex, travel, life, health, workers compensation, risk management, annuity and property and casualty ("P&C") sectors; (b) worldwide sales and support of P&C back-end insurance and broker management systems; (c) worldwide sale, customization, development, implementation and support of its P&C back-end insurance carrier system platforms; (d) risk compliance solutions services, which include insurance certificate origination, certificate tracking, claims adjudication call center, consulting services and back office support; and (e) e-governance/e-learning solutions in emerging world markets. Ebix also provides software development, customization, and consulting services to a variety of entities in the insurance industry, including carriers, brokers, exchanges and standards-making bodies.
Ebix’s revenue streams come from three product/service channels, as discussed in the following paragraphs. The Company derives its revenues primarily from our financial transaction fees, software subscription and transaction fees, software license fees, risk compliance solutions services fees, and professional service fees, including associated fees for consulting, implementation, training, and project management provided to customers with installed systems and applications. 
EbixCash Exchanges
EbixCash revenues are primarily derived from the sales of prepaid gift cards and consideration paid by customers for financial transaction services, including services like transferring or exchanging money. The significant majority of EbixCash revenue is for a single performance obligation and is recognized at a point in time. These revenues vary by transaction based upon channel, send and receive locations, the principal amount sent, whether the money transfer involves different send and receive currencies, and speed of service, as applicable.
EbixCash also offers several other services, including payment services and ticketing and travel services for which revenue is impacted by varying factors. EbixCash acts as the principal in most transactions and reports revenue on a gross basis, as EbixCash controls the service at all times prior to transfer to the customer, is primarily responsible for fulfilling the customer contracts, has the risk of loss, and has the ability to establish transaction prices.
The main services from which EbixCash derives revenue are as follows:
Gift Cards
EbixCash sells general purpose prepaid gift cards to corporate customers and consumers that can be later redeemed at various merchants. The gift cards are co-branded between EbixCash and its card-issuing banking partners and are affiliated with major payment associations such as VISA, Mastercard, and Rupay. The gift cards are sold to a diversified set of corporate customers from various industries. The gift cards are used by corporate customers to disburse incentives to the end users, which are primarily their employees, agents and business associates. The gift cards sold by EbixCash are not reloadable, cannot be used at ATMs or for any other cash-out or funds transfer transactions, and are subject to maximum limits per card (currently INR10,000 or approximately $120). Gift cards issued by EbixCash are valid for a period of 15 months from the date of 
issuance for virtual cards and three years for physical cards. EbixCash has entered into arrangements with banks and financial institutions to settle payments to merchants based on utilization of the gift cards.
The Company has end-to-end responsibilities related to the gift cards sold, from the activation and ongoing utilization of the gift cards to customer service responsibilities to risk of loss due to fraud on the gift cards sold. EbixCash acts a principal in the sale of gift cards and, thus, gift card revenue is recognized on a gross basis (full purchase value at the time of sale) with the corresponding cost of the gift cards recorded as cost of services provided. Unredeemed gift cards at December 31, 2022 totaled approximately $5.4 million and are recorded as deferred revenues in the financial results.
EbixCash Travel Exchanges
EbixCash Travel revenues are primarily derived from commissions and transaction fees received from various travel providers and international exchanges involved in the sale of travel to the consumer. EbixCash Travel revenue is for a single performance obligation and is recognized at a point in time. Travel revenues include: (i) reservation commissions, segment fees from global travel exchange providers, and transaction net revenues (i.e., the amount charged to travelers less the amount owed to travel service providers) in connection with our reservation services; (ii) ancillary fees, including travel insurance-related revenues and certain reservation booking fees; and (iii) credit card processing rebates and customer processing fees. EbixCash Travel services include the sale of hotel rooms, airline tickets, bus tickets and train tickets. EbixCash’s Travel revenue is also derived from ticket sales, wherein the commissions payable to EbixCash Travel, along with any transaction fees paid by travel providers and travel exchanges, is recognized as revenue after completion of the service. The transaction price on such services is agreed upon at the time of the purchase.
EbixCash Travel revenue for the corporate meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions ("MICE") packages is recognized at full purchase value at the completion of the obligation, with the corresponding costs recorded as cost of services provided. For MICE revenues, EbixCash Travel acts as the principal in transactions and, accordingly, reports revenue on a gross basis. EbixCash Travel controls the service at all times prior to transfer to the customer, is responsible for fulfilling the customer contracts, has the risk of loss, and has the ability to establish transaction prices.
EbixCash Money Transfer
For the EbixCash money transfer business, EbixCash has one performance obligation whereupon the customer engages EbixCash to perform one integrated service. This performance obligation typically occurs instantaneously when the beneficiary entitled to receive the money transferred by the sender visits the EbixCash outlet and collects the money. Accordingly, EbixCash recognizes revenue upon completion of the following: (i) the customer’s acknowledgment of EbixCash’s terms and conditions and the receipt of payment information; (ii) the money transfer has been processed; (iii) the customer has received a unique transaction identification number; and (iv) funds are available to be picked up by the beneficiary. The transaction price is comprised of a transaction fee and the difference between the exchange rate set by EbixCash to the customer and the rate available in the wholesale foreign exchange market, as applicable, both of which are readily determinable at the time the transaction is initiated.
Foreign Exchange and Outward Remittance Services
For EbixCash’s foreign exchange and payment services, customers agree to terms and conditions for all transactions, either at the time of initiating a transaction or signing a contract with EbixCash to provide payment services on the customer’s behalf. In the majority of EbixCash’s foreign exchange and payment services, EbixCash makes payments to the recipient to satisfy its performance obligation to the customer and, therefore, EbixCash recognizes revenue on foreign exchange and payment when this performance obligation has been fulfilled.
Consumer Payment Services
EbixCash offers several different bill payment services that vary by considerations, including among other factors: (i) who pays the fee to EbixCash (consumer or biller); (ii) whether the service is offered to all consumers; (iii) whether the service is restricted to existing biller relationships of EbixCash; and (iv) whether the service utilizes a physical agent network offered for consumers’ convenience. The determination of which party is EbixCash’s customer for revenue recognition purposes is based on these considerations for each of EbixCash’s bill payment services. For all transactions EbixCash’s customers agree to EbixCash’s terms and conditions, either at the time of initiating a transaction (where the consumer is determined to be the customer for revenue recognition purposes) or upon signing a contract with EbixCash to provide services on the biller’s behalf (where the biller is determined to be the customer for revenue recognition purposes). As with consumer money transfers, 
customers engage EbixCash to perform one integrated service - collecting money from the consumer and processing the bill payment transaction. This service provides the billers real-time or near real-time information regarding their customers’ payments and simplifies the billers’ collection efforts. The transaction price on bill payment services is contractual and determinable. Certain biller agreements may include per-transaction or fixed periodic rebates, which EbixCash records as a reduction to revenue.
EbixCash Technology and Business Process Outsourcing Services

EbixCash also offers on-demand technology to various providers in the area of lending, wealth and asset management, and travel across the world. Additionally, EbixCash provides IT and call center outsourcing services to companies in a variety of industries, both in India and globally. The EbixCash technology software solutions are generally delivered on a SaaS subscription and/or transaction based pricing model. Please see below under "Insurance Exchanges" a description of revenue recognition policies for Software as a Service, Subscription and Transaction Fees, which are similar to how EbixCash technology software solutions revenues are recognized. For IT and call center outsourcing services provided by EbixCash businesses, revenues are generally recognized on a time and materials or fixed fee basis. Revenues for time and materials are recognized as such services are rendered while fixed fee revenues are recognized based on the input method driven by the expected hours to complete the project measured against the actual hours completed to date.
Insurance Exchanges

Insurance Exchanges revenues are primarily derived from consideration paid by customers related to our SaaS platforms, related services and the licensing of software. A typical contract for our SaaS platform will also include services for setup, customization, transaction processing, maintenance, and/or hosting. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require significant judgment. Set-up and customization services related to our SaaS platforms are not considered to be distinct from the usage fees associated with the SaaS platform and, accordingly, are accounted for as a single performance obligation. These services, along with the usage or transaction fees, are recognized over the contract duration, which considers the significance of the upfront fees in the context of the contract and which may, therefore, exceed the initial contracted term. A customer's transaction volume tends to remain fairly consistent during the contract period without significant fluctuations. The invoiced amount is a reasonable approximation of the revenue that would be allocated to the related period under the variable consideration guidelines in ASC 606-10-32-40. To the extent that a SaaS contract includes subscription services or professional services, apart from the upfront customization, these are considered separate performance obligations. The Company also has separate software licensing (on premise/ perpetual), unrelated to the SaaS platforms, which is recognized at the point in time when the license is transferred to the customer.
Contracts generally do not contain a right of return or refund provisions. Our contracts often do contain overage fees, contingent fees, or service level penalties which are accounted for as variable consideration. Revenue accounted for as variable consideration is immaterial and is recognized using the “right to invoice” practical expedient when the invoiced amount equals the value provided to the customer.
Software-as-a-Service
The Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. Determining the stand-alone selling price may require significant judgment. The stand-alone selling price is the price at which an entity has sold or would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer. The Company determines the stand-alone selling price based on observable price of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances when such observable prices are available. When standalone selling price is not directly observable, the Company estimates the stand-alone selling price using the market assessment approach by considering historical pricing and other market factors.
Software Licenses
Software license revenues attributable to a software license that is a separate performance obligation are recognized at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the license.
Subscription Services
Subscription services revenues are associated with performance obligations that are satisfied over specific time periods and primarily consist of post-contract support services. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. Our subscription contracts are generally for an initial three-year period with subsequent one-year automatic renewals.
Transaction Fees

Transaction revenue is comprised of fees applied to the volume of transactions that are processed through our SaaS platforms. These are typically based on a per-transaction rate and are invoiced for the same period in which the transactions were processed and as the performance obligation is satisfied. The amount invoiced generally equals the value provided to the customer, and revenue is typically recognized when invoiced using the as-invoiced practical expedient.
Professional Services
Professional service revenue primarily consists of fees for setup, customization, training, or consulting services. Professional service fees are generally on a time and materials basis or a fixed fee. Revenues for time and materials are recognized as such services are rendered, while fixed fee revenues are recognized based on the input method that is driven by the expected hours to complete the project measured against the actual hours completed to date. Professional services, particularly related to SaaS platforms, may have significant dependencies on the related licensed software and may not be considered a distinct performance obligation.
Risk Compliance Solutions ("RCS")
RCS revenues consist of two revenue streams - certificates of insurance ("COI") and consulting services. COI revenues are derived from consideration paid by customers for the creation and tracking of certificates of insurance. These revenues are transaction-based. Consulting services revenues are driven by distinct consulting service engagements rendered to customers, for which revenues are recognized using the output method on a time and material basis as the services are performed.
COI Creation and Tracking
The Company provides services to issue and track certificates of insurance in the U.S. and Australian markets. Revenue is derived from transaction fees for each certificate issued or tracked. The Company recognizes revenue at the issuance of each certificate or over the period the certificate is being tracked.
Consulting Services
The Company provides consulting services to clients around the world for project management, integration, development and testing. Consulting services fees are generally earned on either a time and materials or a fixed fee basis. Revenues for time and materials are recognized using an output method as the services are rendered, while fixed fee revenues are recognized based on the input method that is driven by the expected hours to complete the project measured against the actual hours completed to date.
Product Development
The Company focuses on maintaining high quality product development standards. Product development activities include research and the development of platform and/or client specific software enhancements, such as adding functionality, improving usefulness, increasing responsiveness, adapting to newer software and hardware technologies, or developing and maintaining the Company’s websites.
The Company has spent $41.2 million, $40.0 million, and $35.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, on product development initiatives. The Company’s product development efforts are focused on the continued enhancement and redesign of the EbixCash, Insurance Exchange, broker systems, carrier systems, and RCS product and service lines to keep our technology at the cutting edge in the markets we compete. Development efforts also provide new technologies for insurance carriers, brokers and agents, and the redesign, coding and development of new services for international and domestic markets.
The Company has centralized worldwide product development, intellectual property rights development and software and system development operations in Dubai, Singapore, and India. With its strong focus on quality, our Indian operations deliver cutting-edge solutions for our customers across the world. India is rich in technical skills and the cost structure is significantly lower as compared to the U.S. Ebix continues to expand its India operations as a learning center of excellence, 
with a strong focus on hiring skilled professionals with expertise in insurance systems and software applications. This focus on building this knowledge base, combined with the ability to hire more professional resources in India's lower cost structure, has enabled Ebix to consistently protect its knowledge base and to deliver projects in a cost-effective fashion. 
Competition
We believe Ebix is the only company worldwide in insurance and financial software markets that provides services in all three of our above listed revenue channels. Conversely, though, this also means that in each of these areas Ebix has different competitors. In fact, in most of these areas Ebix has a different competitor locally in each region in which it operates. In our Insurance Exchange and EbixCash operations Ebix often has a different competitor on each line of exchange in each country, but the scale of these entities is often very limited.
The following is a closer and more detailed discussion of our business and the competition in each of these three main channels.
EbixCash
With a "Phygital” strategy that combines over 650,000 physical distribution outlets in India and many ASEAN countries with an Omni-channel online digital platform, the Company’s EbixCash financial exchange portfolio encompasses leadership in the areas of domestic and international money remittance, Forex, travel, pre-paid gift cards, utility payments, software solutions for lending and wealth management in India and other Southeast Asian markets. EbixCash’s Forex operations have emerged as a leader in India’s airport Forex business, with operations in 20 international airports, including Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai and Kolkata. EbixCash’s inward remittance business in India is the clear market leader due to its geographic depth and its affiliations with international money transmitters, such as Western Union, Moneygram and Ria. EbixCash, through its travel portfolio of Via and Mercury, is one of Southeast Asia’s leading travel exchanges, with over 500,000 agents and approximately 18,000 registered corporate clients. EbixCash's financial technologies business offers software solutions at the enterprise level for banks, asset and wealth management companies and trust companies within India, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa. EbixCash's e-learning solutions are used by schools throughout India via high quality 2-D and 3-D animation and multimedia learning. EbixCash's business process outsourcing services provide information technology and call center services to a variety of industries.
EbixCash Forex (EbixCash World Money): EbixCash’s Forex operations have emerged as a dominant leader in India’s Forex industry, with operations in approximately 20 international Indian airports and 10 ports serving hundreds of corporate customers, hotels, Duty Free Shops, temples, educational institutes, etc. 
EbixCash World Money is the largest non-bank foreign exchange operation in India in all business segments, including the retail, corporate and bank notes businesses. The company holds a more than 30% market share in the student segment (part of retail), wherein students' overseas education expenses are processed by EbixCash World Money. EbixCash World Money is the largest non-bank corporate Forex provider in the country with more than 2,400 corporate relationships. Competition is fragmented and is comprised of banks such as ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank, along with money exchange companies such as Thomas Cook.
Currently, EbixCash World Money is the single largest money exchange operator at airports in India. EbixCash World Money is also the largest bank note aggregator amongst non-banks, dealing in over 80 different currencies, the highest by any non-bank entity in the business segment. 
The EbixCash inward remittance business continues to hold a dominant position in India and is the principal agent for large Money Transfer Operators ("MTOs") such as Western Union, MoneyGram, Ria, and Transfast. EbixCash is the largest network partner for Western Union globally and an exclusive partner for MoneyGram in India. EbixCash also processes over 70% of all Ria transactions in India through its agent network. 
EbixCash Travel and Holidays: EbixCash Travel and Holidays is a 360-degree holiday and travel solutions enterprise with a holistic focus on delivering exceptional travel experience in all genres, such as holiday, travel, airline, luxury train travel/holidays, buses, cabs, MICE, sporting events, and others. 
Indian travel business enterprises are categorized in the regional and national domain as focused on either a channel, a genre, a product or a demography, and by whether or not allied products, such as Forex and insurance, are offered. MakeMytrip, a relatively new entrant in the pan India holidays space, compared to Thomas Cook and SOTC, has consistently focused on online bookings for holiday/vacation travel. Contrarily, Thomas Cook and SOTC have invested to strengthen their offline presence and market penetration. Thomas Cook is a leading holiday/vacation player that offers Forex services. SOTC 
has also been active in the holiday/vacation travel market. Most other competitors have limited scale compared to EbixCash Travel, Thomas Cook and SOTC.
Insurance Exchanges
Ebix operates a number of insurance exchanges and the competition for each of those exchanges varies within each of the regions in which Ebix operates.
Life Insurance Exchange: Ebix operates a straight-through processing end-to-end Life Exchange service that has three life insurance exchanges in the U.S.: WinFlex, TPP, and LifeSpeed. WinFlex is an exchange for pre-sale life insurance illustrations between brokers and carriers. TPP is an underwriting and highly customized electronic application platform for life insurance and other ancillary products, including disability and critical illness, and LifeSpeed is an order entry platform for life insurance. Each of these exchanges is presently deployed in the U.S., and the Company is also continuing to deploy them in other parts of the world. Ebix has two main competitors in the life exchange area: iPipeline and Insurance Technologies. Ebix differentiates itself by virtue of having an end-to-end solution in the market, with all exchanges being interfaced with other broker systems and CRM solutions, such as Ebix's SmartOffice. We believe Ebix’s exchanges also have the largest aggregation of life insurance brokers and carriers transacting business in the United States.
Annuity Exchange: Ebix operates a straight-through processing end-to-end Annuity Exchange service that has two annuity insurance exchanges in the U.S.: AMP and AN4. These exchanges are platforms for annuity transactions between brokers, carriers, broker general agents (“BGAs”), and other entities involved in annuity transactions. These exchanges are mainly deployed in the U.S.; however, the Company endeavors to deploy it in other parts of the world, such as Latin America and Australia. Ebix has deployed its AN4 solution, which was fully developed internally by Ebix, is highly scalable and customizable, and can be delivered over the cloud. Ebix has two main competitors in the annuity exchange area, iPipeline and Insurance Technologies. Ebix differentiates itself from these competitors by virtue of having an end-to-end solution offering in the market with its exchanges being interfaced with other broker systems and CRM solutions, such as Ebix's SmartOffice. Ebix exchanges transact the largest amount of annuity premiums of any single exchange in the U.S.
SmartOffice: Ebix’s CRM exchange, SmartOffice, is designed to address the specific needs of insurance companies, general agents, banks, financial advisors and investment dealers. SmartOffice is tightly integrated into the Ebix Life, Health, P&C and Annuity exchanges as a means to make end-to-end enterprise-wide information exchange seamless for our clients. Our competitors in this space include Salesforce.com, iPipeline, Redtail, Microsoft, SAP and Oracle. Ebix's insurance specific domain expertise provides the Company with compelling and competitive selling points despite the competitive nature of the CRM market.
Employee Benefits: Ebix currently provides employee benefit and health insurance exchange services using four platforms: Facts, LuminX, HealthConnect and EbixEnterprise. EbixEnterprise, which we developed internally, is the most recent Enterprise Health Exchange being deployed by Ebix in the U.S. These platforms are sold to health carriers and third party administrators. These platforms provide a full range of services, such as quoting, policy administration, document management, enrollment and eligibility, claims adjudication, benefits administration, accounting, and compliance functionality coupled with web portals and data analytics. The HealthConnect insurance quoting portals service the individual and small group marketplace. Ebix has a number of competitors of varying sizes in this area. Trizetto is currently the largest employee benefits software player in the market in the U.S., while there are other smaller competitors, such as Mphasis, EDS, VBA, Plexus, and HealthEdge.
Risk Compliance Solutions (RCS)
Ebix’s focus in this channel pertains to business process outsourcing services that include providing domain intensive project management, system consulting services and claims adjudication/settlement services to clients across the world. Additionally, Ebix RCS has the market leading business for the creation and tracking of certificates of insurance issued in the U.S. and Australian markets. The RCS Channel also consists of Broker and Carrier P&C systems.
Ebix's RCS channel focuses on helping its clients outsource any specific service or manpower to the Company on an onsite or offshore basis. Ebix's RCS COI business services are enabled by the Company’s SaaS-based proprietary software. Ebix’s RCS COI service offerings currently cater to Fortune 500 companies in the U.S. Ebix’s RCS COI service offering in the U.S. competes with companies such as Applied Systems, MyCOI.com, and Certfocus. Due to the highly fragmented market, the Ebix RCS COI service offering also has a number of smaller competitors, such as Datamonitor, CMS, and Exigis.
Ebix operates P&C exchanges in Australia, New Zealand, the U.K., and the U.S. All of these exchanges are targeted to the areas of personal and commercial lines, and facilitate the exchange of insurance data between brokers and insurance 
carriers. There is presently little competition in the P&C exchange area in Australia and New Zealand. Our competitive differentiation exists by virtue of having an end-to-end solution offering in the market allowing our exchanges to be interfaced with multiple broker systems. 
Ebix has three primary P&C broker system offerings worldwide: Ebix Evolution, eGlobal, and WinBEAT. The competition for these broker systems varies within each of the regions in which Ebix provides such products and services.
Ebix Evolution and eGlobal are sold throughout the world. Both systems are multilingual and multi-currency and support country-specific legislative and taxation requirements. These systems are available in a number of languages, such as English, Chinese, Japanese, French, Portuguese, and Spanish. Both Ebix Evolution and eGlobal are targeted to the medium and large P&C brokers around the world, and are available for cloud or on-premise deployment. Competition tends to be different in each country, with no single competitor having a global offering. The two systems compete with home grown systems and regional players in each country. Our competitive advantage and uniqueness stems from multilingual and multi-currency functionality, as well as end-user customization support. Both systems have a uniform common code base globally that allows Ebix to easily tailor features and functionality to customer needs (ease of activating/deactivating functionality).
WinBEAT is a Policy Management System (back-end broker system) targeted to the general insurance broking sector and is primarily sold in Australia. WinBEAT is targeted at small- to medium-sized P&C brokers. The product at present is available only in English and can be deployed in a few hours with minimal training. WinBEAT competes in Australia with local vendors, such as Brokers Advantage and Steadfast Insight. Ebix has deployed WinBEAT to emerging insurance markets, such as Papua New Guinea and some of the Pacific Islands, with possible future deployment to other regional markets in the future.
Ebix's broker systems (Ebix Evolution, eGlobal and WinBEAT) customer base spans over 600 of the approximately 750 P&C brokers in Australia, an 80% market penetration of the P&C broker systems.
In the Carrier P&C Systems, Ebix has two system offerings for P&C carriers, Ebix-Advantage and Ebix AdvantageWeb. Ebix-Advantage is targeted at small, medium and large P&C carriers in the United States that operate in the personal, commercial and specialty line areas of insurance. Ebix AdvantageWeb is designed for the international markets and is targeted at the small, medium and large P&C carriers in the international markets that operate in the personal, commercial and specialty line areas of insurance. Ebix-AdvantageWeb is designed to be multi-currency and multilingual and is deployed in Brazil, the U.K. and the U.S. Competition to both these products comes from large companies, such as CSC, Guidewire, Xchanging, Accenture and specialty medical malpractice players like Delphi.
