 Item 1. Business.
 Overview
 Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “Sorrento”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” and “our”) is a clinical and commercial stage biopharmaceutical company developing a portfolio of next-generation treatments for three major therapeutic areas: cancer, infectious disease and pain. We are focused on transforming science into Saving Life Medicines by advancing innovative product programs into focused commercial entities, like Scilex Holding Company (Nasdaq: SCLX) (“Scilex Holding”).
Cancer. Our proprietary fully human G-MAB antibody library and ACEA small molecule library are the engines driving an innovative pipeline of new solutions for cancer. These molecular entities are then enhanced by leveraging our extensive proprietary immuno-oncology platforms, such as immuno-cellular therapies (“DAR-T”), antibody-drug conjugates (“ADCs”), oncolytic virus (“Seprehvec”) and lymphatic drug delivery (“Sofusa”).
 Infectious Disease. We are focused on preventing, detecting and treating in the fight against COVID-19 today, and aim to be positioned to address the pandemic threats of tomorrow. We have applied our antibody and small molecule capability to develop highly sensitive and rapid diagnostics, and multi-modal treatments for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variants.
Our diagnostics platforms include the COVIMARK lateral flow antigen test (launched as COVISTIX in Mexico and Brazil) and the VIREX platform, which leverages existing worldwide manufacturing infrastructure for glucometers and glucose strip tests to provide affordable and highly scalable, next-generation diagnostic solutions for infectious diseases, liver cancer and other biomarkers. Therapeutic solutions include a next-generation mRNA Omicron vaccine (STI-1557), a next-generation protease inhibitor antiviral pill (STI-1558) as a stand-alone treatment (not requiring the Ritonavir booster) and a variant agnostic mesenchymal stromal cell therapy for people with “long” COVID19. We also continue to evaluate neutralizing antibody approaches effective against emerging variants of concern.
 Pain. In November 2022, we announced the Nasdaq debut of Scilex Holding following the completion of its business combination with Vickers Vantage Corp. I, a special purpose acquisition company. Scilex Holding, with two commercial products and a robust pipeline, is focused on becoming the global pain management leader committed to social, environmental, economic and ethical principles to responsibly develop pharmaceutical products to maximize quality of life. Scilex Holding is an innovative revenue-generating company with its flagship product, ZTlido®, launched in October of 2018 as a prescription lidocaine topical product, which has demonstrated superior adhesion and bioavailability compared to current lidocaine patches. In 2022, Scilex Holding also entered into an exclusive agreement with Romeg Therapeutics, LLC to market and distribute U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”)-approved Gloperba® in the U.S. for painful gout flares. Scilex Holding has built a commercial organization focused on neurologists and pain specialists and intends to leverage this capability for the potential launch of next-generation products that are currently in development. The first of these product candidates, SEMDEXA, is an injectable viscous gel formulation of a widely used corticosteroid designed to address the limitations associated with off label corticosteroid epidural injections. SEMDEXA has completed its pivotal study and Scilex Holding is preparing for its new drug application (“NDA”) submission.
 We are also developing Resiniferatoxin (“RTX”), a naturally occurring non-opioid ultra-potent transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 agonist. When injected peripherally, a sustained desensitization occurs, resulting in reduction of noxious chronic pain symptoms that can last for months. RTX has the potential to be a multi-indication franchise asset and is nearing pivotal studies in intractable pain associated with cancer and moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis pain.
 
Voluntary Filing Under Chapter 11
 As previously reported in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 13, 2023, we and our wholly owned direct subsidiary, Scintilla Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (together with us, the “Debtors”), commenced voluntary proceedings under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The Chapter 11 proceedings are jointly administered under the caption In re Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc., et al. (the “Chapter 11 Cases”). We continue to operate our business in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. At hearings before the Bankruptcy Court on February 16, 2023 and February 21, 2023, we obtained approval from the Bankruptcy Court of certain “first day” motions containing customary relief intended to assure our ability to continue our ordinary course operations during the Chapter 11 Cases.
 Additional information about the Chapter 11 Cases, including access to documents filed with the Bankruptcy Court, is available online at https://cases.stretto.com/sorrento, a website administered by Stretto, a third-party bankruptcy claims and noticing agent. The information on that website is not incorporated by reference into, and does not constitute part of, this Annual Report on Form
10-K.DIP Term Sheet
 As previously reported in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 22, 2023, we and Scintilla executed that certain Debtor-In-Possession Term Loan Facility Summary of Terms and Conditions (the “DIP Term Sheet”) with JMB Capital Partners Lending, LLC (“JMB Capital” or the “DIP Lender”), pursuant to which JMB Capital (or its designees or its assignees) is providing us with a non-amortizing super-priority senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $75,000,000 in term loan commitments (the “DIP Facility”), subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the DIP Term Sheet. On February 20, 2023, we filed the Debtors’ Emergency Motion For Entry of Interim and Final Orders (I) Authorizing The Debtors to (A) Obtain Senior Secured Superpriority Postpetition Financing and (B) Use Cash Collateral, (II) Granting Liens and Providing Claims With Superpriority Administrative Expense Status, (III) Modifying The Automatic Stay, (IV) Scheduling A Final Hearing, and (V) Granting Related Relief (the “DIP Motion”) seeking the Bankruptcy Court’s approval of the DIP Facility and certain related relief. A copy of the DIP Term Sheet was attached to the Motion.
 At a hearing before the Bankruptcy Court on February 21, 2023, the Bankruptcy Court granted the DIP Motion and entered an interim order (the “Interim DIP Order”) approving the DIP Facility on an interim basis and providing us with the necessary liquidity to continue to operate in Chapter 11. Upon entry of the Interim DIP Order and satisfaction of all applicable conditions precedent, as set forth in the DIP Term Sheet, we were authorized to make a single, initial draw of $30,000,000 on the DIP Facility (the “Initial Draw”). Definitive financing documentation, including a credit agreement and other documents evidencing the DIP Facility (collectively, the “DIP Documents”), will be negotiated and executed as soon as possible following the Initial Draw on the DIP Facility. The remaining amount of the DIP Facility will be available to the Debtors, subject to entry of an order granting the DIP Motion on a final basis (the “Final Order”) and compliance with the terms, conditions, and covenants to be set forth in the definitive DIP Documents, through additional draws of no less than $5,000,000 each upon five business days’ written notice to the DIP Lender. The DIP Facility contains economic and other terms that are the most favorable to us compared to the other proposals received by us, including, among others: (i) immediate access to interim financing of up to $30,000,000 (with up to $75,000,000 to be available in the aggregate), (ii) minimum draws of $5,000,000, (iii) interest at a per annum rate equal to 14% payable in cash on the first day of each month in arrears (and a default interest rate that shall accrue at an additional per annum rate of 3% plus the non-default interest, payable in cash on the first day of each month), and (iv) other fees and charges as described in the DIP Term Sheet. The DIP Facility is secured by first-priority liens on substantially all of the Debtors’ unencumbered assets, subject to certain enumerated exceptions, and second-priority liens on those assets of the Debtors that are encumbered by certain permitted liens (as set forth in the Interim DIP Order).
 The DIP Facility matures on the earliest of: (i) July 31, 2023; (ii) the effective date of any Chapter 11 plan of reorganization with respect to the Debtors; (iii) the consummation of any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Debtors pursuant to section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code; (iv) the date of the acceleration of the DIP Loans and the termination of the DIP Commitments in accordance with the DIP Documents (each as defined in the DIP Term Sheet); (v) dismissal of the Chapter 11 Cases or conversion of the Chapter 11 Cases into cases under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code; and (vi) forty-five (45) days after the filing of the DIP Motion (or such later date as agreed to by the DIP Lender), unless the Final Order has been entered by the Bankruptcy Court on or prior to such date. The DIP Facility does not contain a roll-up or cross-collateralization of prepetition debt or otherwise dictate how prepetition claims will be addressed in a Chapter 11 plan.
 The Debtors anticipate seeking final approval of the DIP Facility at a final hearing on the DIP Motion on or around March 29, 2023, or any such other date that is no later than forty-five (45) days following the date of filing of the DIP Motion, as required under the DIP Term Sheet. Listing
 On February 13, 2023, we received written notice (the “Delisting Notice”) from the staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying us that, as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases and in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5101, 5110(b) and IM-5101-1, the staff of Nasdaq had determined that our common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq. In the Delisting Notice, the staff of Nasdaq referenced the Chapter 11 Cases and associated public concerns raised by them, concerns regarding the residual equity interest of the existing listed securities holders and concerns about our ability to sustain compliance with all requirements for continued listing on Nasdaq. The Delisting Notice also indicated that we may appeal Nasdaq’s determination pursuant to procedures set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5800 Series. On February 21, 2023, we requested an appeal of Nasdaq’s determination and a hearing before a Nasdaq hearings panel. We subsequently determined not to continue with the appeal process. In accordance with the Delisting Notice, trading of our common stock on Nasdaq was suspended at the opening of business on February 23, 2023, and at such time, our common stock

commenced trading on the Pink Open Market under the symbol “SRNEQ”.
Our Strategy
 Our primary goal is to leverage our antibody and small molecule development expertise to address significant unmet medical needs that can significantly improve a patient’s quality of life. In the face of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we marshalled our resources to generate antibody-based treatments and diagnostic initiatives for COVID-19 in addition to acquiring other treatment assets to treat the entire spectrum of COVID-19 infections, from outpatients with mild infections, to hospitalized patients with moderate or severe infections. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to make progress in our oncology programs and programs for refractory chronic pain conditions, such as intractable pain due to advanced cancer or knee osteoarthritis.
 Our core strategic objectives and resources are:
 1. Use a deliberate process to screen and optimize our lead product candidates to fill identified unmet needs and advance them rapidly into the clinic. Once demonstrated to be safe and efficacious, we plan to continue to drive through later-phase (II and III) studies toward an NDA filing. Early in this process, we evaluate each program for potential accelerated approval or breakthrough therapy designation to fast-track development.
 2. Collaborate with key opinion leaders and leading clinical and research institutes to enhance our clinical development plans and achieve our goals. We currently have such agreements in place with the Mayo Clinic, Karolinska Institute, The Scripps Research Institute, The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) and Tufts Medical School, among others.
 3. Maximize differentiation of active antibody programs by leveraging proprietary platforms, such as DAR-T, our antibody-drug conjugate platform, our ADNAB platform, and our SofusaTM Lymphatic Drug Treatment platform to treat various immune-related disorders.
 4. Continue to build clinical development capability to rapidly advance priority programs through development decision gates. These include novel cellular therapy programs (CD38 DAR-T), ADC programs (CD38 ADC), checkpoint inhibitors (CD47, PD-L1) and small molecules (Abivertinib and STI-1558). We will continue to develop our fully human monoclonal antibody (“mAb”) portfolio for new ADCs and bispecific mAbs. In addition, we expect to commence several proof of concept clinical trials with our ADNAB and Sofusa device platforms to fully exploit the potential of these potentially disruptive technologies. We anticipate generating data to support more than a dozen new investigational new drug applications (“INDs”) each year, including in 2023.
 5. Manufacture our preclinical and clinical trial materials to support Phase I and II trial manufacturing needs in-house. We have established quality control and quality assurance programs to ensure that our products are produced under current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”), and other applicable domestic and foreign regulations.
 6. Continue strategic partnerships to share in the risk reward of our core franchises and to derive near-term value from our key programs. Our partnering objectives include generating revenue through license fees, milestone-related development fees and royalties as well as profit shares or joint ventures to generate potential returns from our product candidates and technologies. As clinical programs advance toward commercialization, we will evaluate the strategy to maximize the human impact, commercial impact and value to stockholders.
 Segment Information
 We operate in two operating and reportable segments, Sorrento Therapeutics and Scilex.
Sorrento Therapeutics. The Sorrento Therapeutics segment is organized around our Immune-Oncology therapeutic area, leveraging our proprietary G-MAB antibody library and targeted delivery modalities to generate the next-generation of cancer therapeutics. These modalities include proprietary chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (“CAR-T”), DAR-T, ADCs as well as oncolytic viruses approaches. Additionally, this segment also includes Abivertinib, an oral next-generation dual EGFR/BTK inhibitor, Sofusa, a drug delivery technology that delivers biologics directly into the lymphatic system to potentially achieve improved efficacy and fewer adverse effects than standard parenteral immunotherapy, and RTX, which is a non-opioid-based neurotoxin currently in clinical trials for late stage cancer pain and moderate to severe osteoarthritis of the knee pain. This segment further includes the full suite of COVID-19 treatments, diagnostics and vaccines under development.


Scilex. The Scilex segment is largely organized around our non-opioid pain management operations and clinical pipeline. Revenues from the Scilex segment are exclusively derived from the sale of ZTlido.
Clinical Programs
 G-MAB: Fully-human Antibody Library Platform
 Our G-MAB library (“G-MAB”), which is the foundation of many of our product candidates, was initially invented by Henry Ji, Ph.D., our co-founder, President and Chief Executive Officer. We believe our proprietary G-MAB library is one of the industry’s largest and most diverse fully-human antibody libraries, with an estimated one quadrillion unique antibodies available for drug discovery and development. We believe G-MAB may offer the following advantages over competing antibody discovery technologies:
 •G-MAB has been designed to provide a full spectrum of human immunoglobulin gene recombination in fully-human mAbs. Unlike chimeric and humanization technologies, G-MAB has allowed the generation of antibodies with fully-human sequences without the challenges and limitations of animal-to-human gene conversion procedures.
 •Because G-MAB represents an in vitro human mAb library technology, research suggests that it may enable faster and cost-effective in vitro screening of a large number of antigens. G-MAB is designed so that any antigen of interest can be investigated, with no dependence on the successful induction of a host immune response against the antigen.
 
The following is a depiction of the types of fully-human mAbs that we have derived from G-MAB. It includes antibodies that bind to a wide range of targets, from small molecular weight antigens to large protein complexes antigens, such as G-Protein Coupled Receptors, a difficult class of antigens to raise therapeutics antibodies against.
 

Our objective is to leverage G-MAB to develop first-in-class or best-in-class antibody drug candidates that will possess greater efficacy and potentially fewer side effects as compared to existing drugs and develop them as novel monotherapies (PD-L1, CD47), ADCs, e.g., CD38, BCMA, components of bispecific antibodies, and as part of our adoptive cell therapy (CD38 DAR-T or dimeric antigen receptor-T cell) and oncolytic virus program (Seprehvec).
 To date, we have screened over 100 validated targets and generated a number of fully-human antibodies against these targets which are at various stages of development. These include PD-1, PD-L1, CD38, CD47, BCMA, CTLA-4, CD123, CD47, LAG3, ROR1, CCR2 and CD137, among others. Upon the completion of preclinical studies, our objective is to, independently or in tandem with our strategic collaborators, file INDs for the most promising product candidates.







COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2)
 COVID-19 is now transitioning from pandemic to endemic phase with rapidly mutating SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants. Infection with COVID-19 continues to be a significant public health concern, especially in high-risk populations who may develop progressive symptoms requiring hospitalization. Some patients are long COVID-19 survivors, who continue to have persistent symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, headaches, palpitations and impairments in mental health and cognition.
 We have tapped into the ACEA small molecule library to identify a potent protease inhibitor (STI-1558 or OVYDSOTM) with a dual mechanism of action, which is being developed as a standalone oral treatment for COVID-19 and does not require co-administration of Ritonavir as a booster. We also have developed a novel next-generation mRNA Omicron vaccine which, in addition to intramuscular administration, could be developed with the Sofusa MuVaxx lymphatic delivery system, which has the potential to improve vaccine efficacy and reduce the dose required. Paired with our highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tests for COVID-19 in development, we are one of the few companies with multi-modal solutions aimed to prevent, detect and treat across the COVID-19 continuum.
 PREVENT: STI-1557 is a single variant mRNA vaccine designed to protect against B1.1.529 (Omicron) and its subvariants. The mRNA construct is codon-optimized for optimal expression in humans and mutations were introduced into S protein to produce a prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S(2P) protein. The mutations potentially reduce the release of free S1 protein into circulation. STI-1557 is further encapsulated in a proprietary lipid nanoparticle formulation (“LNP”) to protect mRNAs from degradation and enable potent translation of the S protein in host cells after intramuscular (“IM”) delivery, thus inducing an adaptive immune response.
DETECT: COVIMARKTM (Trademarked COVISTIXTM in Mexico and Brazil) is a lateral flow rapid diagnostic test that offers early and accurate SARS-CoV-2 detection to not only protect the population, but also to facilitate early treatment, which may result in improved outcomes for patients who become infected. Using our unique capability to rapidly screen and select highly specific and strong-binding antibodies, we developed COVISTIX, a highly sensitive 15-minute antigen test for detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The test uses a proprietary platinum/gold colloidal core plus a 2 antibody combination that yields up to 100-fold increases in sensitivity over conventional lateral flow colloidal gold assays. COVIMARK has also demonstrated high sensitivity across all variants, including Omicron and its subvariants, and maintained its sensitivity even in an “all-comers” (asymptomatic and symptomatic) patient population. This technology is ideally suited for either rapid point-of-care (“POC”) testing or at-home use. COVISTIX has been Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) cleared in, and is being marketed in, Mexico (COFEPRIS) and Brazil (ANVISA), and is CE-marked in Europe for IVD professional POC use. We are awaiting regulatory clearance from Canada (Health

Canada) under our EUA application. COVIMARK information has been filed and is pending approval in Brazil as an at home self-test version of COVISTIX.
 Virex Health, Inc. (“Virex”) was acquired by Sorrento in February of 2022. Its primary goal is to provide a highly accurate, scalable and affordable solution for the clinical need to rapidly and quantitatively detect emerging pathogens. Motivated by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, Virex re-envisioned and repurposed the common and widely used glucometer to detect a virus instead. Central to Virex’s vision is to capitalize from the existing manufacturing infrastructure for glucometers and glucose strips for rapid production and scale-up. The Virex platform technology combines the advances in lateral flow assays with electrochemical detection as in a glucometer. Virex envisions a platform technology that is independent of both sample used (saliva, nasal swab, blood, urine) and pathogen target analyte for rapid and sensitive detection of pathogens. Once developed, the Virex platform may be adapted to detect multiple pathogens by changing out the detection antibodies (from the Sorrento G-MAB library) and modifying the system software. This system is being developed to detect current infectious diseases (COVID, FLU, RSV), sexually transmitted diseases and oncology biomarkers.
 TREAT: OVYDSO (STI-1558) is a highly bioavailable prodrug which in its active form (AC1115) binds to Cys-145 of the catalytic domain of Mpro, which is near 100% conserved in all known SARS-CoV-2 variants and achieves a broad-spectrum anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity against the original WuHan/Washington strain as well as subsequent variants of concern (“VoCs”), such as Delta and Omicron. STI-1558 is also a Cathepsin L inhibitor, which may block effective viral entry into host cells. The oral bioavailability is up to 85% with fast absorption and enhanced drug exposure in plasma, which has the potential to allow early treatment of COVID-19 at home by oral administration. OVYDSO is rapidly converted to AC1115 in a non-enzymatic process in the bloodstream.
 Based upon a completed Phase I study in Australia (n=58), OVYDSO achieves pharmacokinetic levels necessary to avoid the need for co-administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g., Ritonavir) to increase the plasma exposure allowing for standalone treatment with low risk for drug-drug interactions. Single oral doses up to 2000 mg and twice daily (“BID”) doses up to 800 mg for more than a week were well-tolerated. This data was confirmed in a separate study conducted in China in healthy subjects for single doses up to 2000 mg and in patients positive for COVID-19 up to 800 mg BID. Additionally, preliminary viral load data suggests that OVYDSO can reduce viral load rapidly with more than a log-10 reduction by day 3 of treatment. A pivotal trial is planned to start early in 2023 in China and Phase II studies are planned in both the U.S. and Mexico. This oral drug has straightforward formulation with good stability and simple manufacture with controlled cost appropriate for scalability of active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) synthesis with controlled cost allowing for global accessibility and application.
Oncology and Immunomodulator Indications
 Allogeneic Anti-CD38 KOKI DAR-T (STI-1492) Program
 The membrane glycoprotein CD38 is widely found on the surface of lymphoid and myeloid lineages, including B, T and NK cells, but is absent from most mature resting lymphocytes, with the notable exception of terminally differentiated plasma cells. Because CD38 is highly expressed on multiple myeloma cells, it represents a valuable and validated therapeutic target against myeloma. Multiple myeloma is a hematologic malignancy in which clonal plasma cells accumulate in the bone marrow or extramedullary sites and give rise to clinical complications such as painful, lytic bone lesions, hypercalcemia, renal impairment, cytopenias, and symptomatic plasmacytomas.
 We have developed an innovative dimeric antigen receptors DAR-T cell (“DAR-T”) allogeneic cellular therapy platform based on the complete antigen-binding fragment (“Fab”) of the parental antibody. During the production of STI-1492, there is a “knock-in” of the DAR into the T-cell receptor (“TCR”) alpha constant region gene. The TCR alpha is simultaneously inactivated (“knock-out”) by this DAR knock-in process, allowing allogeneic T cells to be administered therapeutically without the development of graft-versus-host disease. In addition, STI-1492 utilizes a 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain. The anti-CD38 DAR design is associated with enhanced cytotoxic activity, longer persistence and potentially less toxicity as compared with the conventional anti-CD38 CAR design in preclinical studies. The ability to administer this agent as modified allogeneic T cells allows STI-1492 to be stored as an off-the-shelf agent that eliminates the need for leukapheresis and the treatment delay for the manufacturing process for each individual patient associated with autologous cellular therapy. It is generally accepted that Fabs more closely mimic the functional and biophysical properties of natural antibodies. Our data showed that the DAR-T cells exhibited a higher functional activity with regards to cytotoxicity against target-expressing tumor cells compared to CAR-T cells. In preclinical mouse models, the DAR-T cells demonstrated increased anti-tumor potency.


Our non-viral knock-out knock-in (“KOKI”) technology may offer several potential benefits over existing virus-based technology using transgene-encoding lentivirus, retrovirus or adeno-associated virus to introduce antigen receptor constructs into healthy donor (allogeneic) or cancer patient (autologous) T cells. These potential advantages of our KOKI technology include:
 •site-specific integration of transgenes into a pre-selected locus in the T cell genome;
•streamlined method for transgene construct production without need for laborious and time-consuming virus production, release and validation processes, resulting in a shorter research and development timelines for IND-enabling activities; and
•applicability to both autologous and allogeneic cellular therapies.

After completion of a successful IND submission for STI-1492 (anti-CD38 DAR-T), an allogeneic non-viral anti-CD38 A2 KOKI DAR-T cell agent (second generation anti-CD38 “knock-out knock-in” dimeric antigen receptor 4-1BBζ - engineered T cells) for subjects with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (“RRMM”). We began dosing subjects in the first-in-human ascending dose study in the fourth quarter of 2022. We have also established a partnership with Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm to study the use of STI-1492 in RRMM. To date, there have been no infusion reactions, cytokine release syndrome, graft versus host disease and delayed immune reactions. The CD38 construct is the first of a platform of products to be generated. We are currently applying our DAR-T technology to our ongoing cell therapy programs for multiple hematological and solid tumor indications.
Anti-CD38 Antibody-Drug Conjugate (“ADC”) Program
AL amyloidosis is an incurable disease that is characterized by a clonal population of bone marrow plasma cells that produces a monoclonal light chain immunoglobulin. The clonal plasma cells often make up less than 10% of the nucleated cells in the bone marrow in patients with AL amyloidosis. The light chain immunoglobulin is of a ĸ or λ type and is produced as either an intact molecule or a fragment. The light chain protein produced by the dysfunctional plasma cells associated with AL amyloidosis is misfolded, forming β-pleated sheets that deposit in tissues in the form of amyloid fibrils. The insoluble tissue protein deposits interfere with organ function and the soluble circulating light chains may be toxic to organs as well. The clinical features of AL amyloidosis depend on which organs are involved and may include restrictive cardiomyopathy, nephrotic syndrome, hepatic dysfunction, peripheral and/or autonomic neuropathy and signs or symptoms of an atypical multiple myeloma.
 STI-6129 (anti-CD38 ADC) is composed of a human monoclonal anti-CD38 A2 antibody (STI-5171) covalently bound by a chemical linker to a dolastatin tubulin inhibitor chemotherapeutic derivative (duostatin 5.2). STI-5171 was generated from Sorrento’s proprietary G-MAB antibody library. The binding affinity of STI-5171 to CD38 is comparable to that of daratumumab but it binds to different epitopes (Sorrento data on file). The STI-6129 ADC is produced by conjugation of the drug-linker-duostatin moiety to the parent STI-5171 monoclonal antibody. The heavy chain of the STI-5171 parent antibody included in the STI-6129 ADC has been modified by a C246→S mutation that substitutes a serine amino acid for cysteine. This substitution results in an antibody with 3 inter-chain disulfide bonds instead of the 4 disulfide bonds present in wild type IgG1 antibodies and provides an ADC with drug to antibody ratio of 3 (Sorrento data on file). Using the proprietary covalent linker technology, we hope to avoid premature release of the toxin in the bloodstream to eliminate most of the off-target adverse events, such as ocular toxicity. Upon binding to CD38 target cell surface antigen, the STI-6129 ADC is internalized by the cell and undergoes lysosomal degradation resulting in the release of the duostatin 5.2 chemotherapeutic agent.
 After a successful IND submission, STI-6129 is currently enrolling patients in an ascending dose study to identify the maximum tolerated dose to be used for the treatment of AL amyloidosis, RRMM, solid tumors such as metastatic lung or esophageal cancer and t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia. We have also established a partnership with Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm to study the use of STI-6129 in AL amyloid and RRMM. To date, no ocular toxicity has been observed. Once a recommended Phase II dose is identified, an expansion cohort will be enrolled.
Anti-CD47 fully-human mAb (STI-6643): Several studies have described the role of cluster of differentiation 47/Signal regulatory protein-alpha (“CD47/SIRPα”) interaction in regulating macrophage-mediated phagocytosis and dendritic cell-mediated cross-priming of T cells. CD47 is a ubiquitously expressed immuno-regulatory glycoprotein (also known as integrin-associated protein) of the immunoglobulin superfamily best known for its so-called ‘don’t eat me’ function that prevents phagocytic removal of healthy cells by the body’s immune system. Many cancers present high levels of this signal on their cell surface, thereby disrupting anti-cancer immune responses. Given CD47’s essential role as a negative checkpoint for innate immunity and subsequent adaptive immunity, the CD47-SIRPα axis has been explored as a new target for cancer immunotherapy and its disruption has demonstrated

great therapeutic promise in reestablishing antitumor activity in vivo. However, significant anemia and thrombocytopenia has plagued early product candidates (e.g., Hu5F9-G4 or magrolimab, a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody) due to CD47 expression on normal cells, particularly aging red blood cells which may lose this ‘marker of self’ becoming susceptible to clearance by splenic macrophages.
 STI-6643 demonstrated minimal T, B or NK cell depletion as opposed to reference clones (prepared based on sequence analysis) which could result in improved efficacy by preserving the infiltrating anti-tumor immune cells. While preclinical studies suggested that STI-6643 would produce reduced hemolysis, the initial clinical results demonstrated the need to identify a priming dose to avoid significant post-dose anemia. While we are continuing enrollment with IV administration, we also have amended our protocol to incorporate Sofusa’s DoseConnect device to administer STI-6643 lymphatically to see if introduction of the product into the lymphatic space will reduce anemia while maintaining efficacy.
 FUJOVEE (Abivertinib; STI-5656): FUJOVEE is a novel dual target irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It is a 3rd oral epidermal growth factor receptor (“EGFR”) that has shown benefit in treating patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) resistant to first-line EGFR inhibitors due to T790M mutant forms of EGFR. It is also a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (“BTK”) inhibitor that irreversibly binds to the BTK receptor, preventing the phosphorylation of the receptor. Due to this effect, it has shown potent immunomodulatory activities in vitro with potent inhibition of key pro-inflammatory cytokine production, including IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha. These cytokines may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (“ARDS”) or COVID-19-induced respiratory distress and with cytokine release syndrome or cytokine storm. As a BTK inhibitor, FUJOVEE has shown benefit in treating various B cell lymphomas (“BCLs”) and may be beneficial in blocking extra-gonadal androgen production, which is associated with a worse outcome in metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (“mCRPC”).
 In a pivotal study conducted in China of FUJOVEE as a second line treatment of heavily pretreated NSCLC patients with resistant EGFR mutations, 227 heavily pretreated NSCLC patients were enrolled and 209 were response evaluable with up to 38.8 months of follow up. An independent review committee determined that the confirmed overall response rate (“ORR”) was 56.5% (118/209), the complete response rate was 5.3% (11/209) and the median overall survival was 28.2 months. FUJOVEE was well-tolerated at doses up to 600 mg daily.
 Based on these results, we are closing the study to calculate more mature IRC data, have requested a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA and anticipate formal NDA filings with other regulatory agencies in different countries.
FUJOVEE has also been studied in various BCLs in China, including marginal zone lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic lymphoma, follicular lymphoma and hairy cell lymphoma at doses up to 200 mg BID. In the initial study, the ORR was 81.8% and the disease control rate was 95.8%. The treatment was well-tolerated across all treatment cohorts.
Finally, based on preclinical data showing that 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 (“3βHSD1”), an enzyme that converts dihydroepiandosterone (DHEA) to testosterone or dihydrotestosterone (T/DHT) and is also necessary for de novo androgen synthesis from cholesterol, there has been a recognition of 3βHSD1 as a biomarker for patients with mCRPC who are likely to have a worse outcome. Preclinical data showed that BTK inhibitors can block this enzyme system, thereby reducing extragonadal androgen production. We have partnered with the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trial Consortium (“PCCTC”) to begin enrolling in the Phase II MAVERICK study early in 2023. In this study, PCCTC investigators will profile whole exome DNA, whole transcriptome RNA and proteins from samples collected from participants enrolled in the trial, creating a molecular blueprint to better understand mechanisms of response and resistance following therapy. The MAVERICK study is the first biomarker clinical trial for patients with the HSD3B1 adrenal-permissive genotype in men with mCRPR and will evaluate the efficacy and safety of FUJOVEE plus abiraterone.
 Oncolytic Virus (STI-1386; Seprehvec®): We previously completed two trials using herpes simplex virus lacking infected cell protein 34.5 (“HSV1716”) or Seprehvir®, a first-generation oncolytic virus, to treat solid pediatric or young adult non-central nervous system tumors or malignant pleural mesothelioma with intratumoral, intravenous or intrapleural administration. A second-generation product, Seprehvec is a platform that can generate a number of possible product candidates. We successfully completed an IND submission targeting pancreatic cancer, soft tissue sarcomas and hepatic metastases and expect enrollment in the first quarter of 2023. 
Anti-Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PDL-1) mAb: We and our joint venture partner ImmuneOncia Therapeutics, Inc., which is located in South Korea, recently released the results of the Phase II study using IMC-001 (STI-3031) to treat patients with extranodal natural killer T cell (“NK/T”) lymphoma, nasal type, a rare cancer that occurs mostly in Asian countries. In this study, 60% (six out of ten evaluable patients) achieved an objective response with STI-3031, all of whom showed a complete response. Four of these six

patients were on treatment for over a year, indicating an outstanding safety profile and durable response.
We licensed a different PDL-1 mAb (socazolimab) from our G-MAB library to China Oncology Focus Ltd. (“COF”), an affiliate of Lee’s Pharmaceutical Holdings, Ltd., for Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Socazolimab had previously been granted breakthrough designation by the National Medical Products Administration in the People’s Republic of China. In mid-2022, it was announced that COF had fully enrolled 498 patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer in a randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled trial of socazolimab combined with chemotherapy as first-line therapy. Additionally, an NDA is pending for treatment of recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.
Antibody-Drug Nanoparticle Albumin Bound (“ADNAB”) Platform: We have partnered with Svetomir Markovic, MD, Ph.D. at Mayo Clinic Rochester to use the nanoparticle human serum albumin bound paclitaxel (nab paclitaxel or other chemotherapeutic agents) platform to bind various monoclonal antibodies to the external surface of the albumin micelles to form stable complexes that can be designed to target specific cancers for delivery directly to the tumor microenvironment. This partnership would leverage our existing Sorrento mAb library, PD-1, PD-L1, CD38, CD47, BCMA, CTLA-4, CD123, CD47, LAG3, ROR1, VEGFR2, CCR2 and CD137, among others, to create ADNAB products that may enhance tumor response. The first programs (B cell lymphomas, melanoma and gynecological cancers) are already ongoing under investigator-initiated INDs that we support. We initiated a trial with Mayo Clinic physicians to use our PD-L1 (STI-3031) mAb in an investigator-initiated trial in solid tumor.
SofusaTM Lymphatic Delivery System (“S-LDS”): Sofusa is a novel technology platform designed for targeted drug delivery to lymphatics vessels and lymph nodes. Abnormal immune system function is implicated in many conditions such as cancer and autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and psoriasis). Sofusa’s proprietary nanotopography draped microneedles have been shown to reversibly open tight junctions in the skin and facilitate paracellular and transcellular transport across the epidermis. In preclinical biodistribution studies, this proprietary microneedle and microfluidics system has consistently demonstrated the ability to deliver over 40-fold in drug concentration to lymph nodes (with lower drug concentration in systemic organs) when compared to traditional IV and subcutaneous (“SC”) injections. For drugs that target the immune system, Sofusa offers the potential to achieve a superior clinical response with potentially lower doses and/or side effects versus systemic injections or infusions.
 Initial clinical proof of concept programs are focused on anti-TNFα in rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”) and in cancer with a checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-1) in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (“CTCL”). The Sofusa division also has a research collaboration with Mayo Clinic to explore lymphatic targeting in melanoma and lymphoma. The first 12-week cohort of the Phase Ib open label RA study has been completed (n=10). Patients who were enrolled in this study had inadequate response to the standard 50mg dose of an approved TNF inhibitor subcutaneous (“SC”) treatment and were switched to Sofusa lymphatic treatment. In this study, 100% (10 of 10) patients achieved a significant improvement in disease activity and lymphatic function following initiation of Sofusa lymphatic treatment, with dose levels at half of the prior SC dose or less. Disease activity as measured by DAS28 scores improved an average of 34% and reduction in tender joint count achieved a 70% improvement in these patients. The CTCL study and Mayo Clinic melanoma studies are currently enrolling.
Based upon our Sofusa core microneedle technology, we also developed the Sofusa MuVaxx device for the administration of small volume peptides and vaccines. The skin (rich in dendritic cells) and lymph nodes are the primary organs for generating both humoral immunity (IgM and IgG) and cellular immunity (memory T-Cells) for long-term protection. In a preclinical study using a model Ovalbumin (“OVA”) protein antigen, Sofusa MuVaxx demonstrated a 60-100 fold increase in anti-OVA IgG antibodies versus intramuscular (“IM”) injections, and in another preclinical COVID-19 vaccine study the Sofusa device resulted in 10-40X higher T-Cell response versus IM and intradermal injections. The Sofusa MuVaxx device is designed to be a simple low-cost attachment to a standard syringe for rapid large-scale deployment of our vaccine candidates and, due to the small needle size, is expected to result in a pain-free injection. The Sofusa MuVaxx is being developed with our mRNA Omicron vaccine.
 Chronic Pain
 Resiniferatoxin (“RTX”) Programs: RTX is a naturally occurring compound obtained from cactus-like succulents of the Euphorbia species. An ultra-potent TRPV1 agonist, RTX belongs to the same general TRPV1 agonist family as capsaicin, the active ingredient in red chili peppers, but differs from capsaicin in its unique binding properties and thousand-fold higher potency. As an agonist, RTX produces a sustained opening of calcium channels expressed on neurons, either in the end-terminals or cell bodies of unmyelinated C-fibers or thinly myelinated A-delta fibers. The effect from this sustained calcium influx depends on the location that RTX is injected. When injected peripherally near end-terminals (e.g., intra-articularly), a sustained defunctionalization or desensitization occurs resulting in reduction in noxious chronic pain symptoms that can last for months. When injected neuraxially (intrathecally or epidurally) rapid programmed cell death of TRPV1-expressing neurons targeted by the RTX injection can produce

long-lasting improvement in noxious chronic pain that has been refractory to treatment (e.g., cancer related pain). RTX does not interact with and leaves intact unaffected non-TRPV1-expressing nerves (touch, motor control and position sense).
 An investigator-sponsored Phase I clinical trial of intrathecal RTX has been ongoing at the NIH under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement. To date, 18 patients with terminal cancer pain have been treated intrathecally at the NIH. Additional enrollment in this study is on-going with a last dose level being finalized.
 In the fourth quarter of 2022, the NIH obtained clearance for a new IND to treat intractable Morton’s neuroma using a local peripheral injection of RTX in an ascending dose study. The study will measure the ability of RTX to relieve acute and chronic neuropathic pain with a perineural administration of RTX. Positive results would inform the ability of RTX to be used in replacement of or to lower use of opioids in neuropathic and peripheral painful conditions such as CRPS or for local surgical applications such as below the knee amputations.
 After concluding a Phase Ib clinical trial with epidural RTX in subjects with intractable pain due to advanced cancer, a Phase II placebo-controlled study was cleared to proceed in 2022 and is expected to enroll in the first quarter of 2023. This study will enroll approximately 120 patients and is designed to identify a pivotal dose to carry forward into a pivotal trial and to confirm the safety profile of epidural RTX in advanced cancer patients. The study will also monitor opioid consumption in the advanced stage cancer population, with the goal of confirming RTX as a viable opioid-sparing therapeutic approach for patients with otherwise intractable pain.
 After concluding a Phase Ib clinical trial with intra-articular RTX administration for moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis (“OA”) of the knee, a Phase II placebo- and active-controlled study was cleared to proceed and completed enrollment in the third quarter of 2022. This study enrolled approximately 120 patients and is designed to identify a pivotal dose to carry forward into a pivotal trial, confirm the safety profile of intra-articular RTX, and to demonstrate the efficacy and durability of reduction in pain due to knee OA.
 Additional preclinical efforts are underway to pursue other indications for RTX including trigeminal neuralgia, burning mouth syndrome and peripheral nerve block to treat neuropathic pain.
 Additional preclinical efforts have been conducted with a goal of meeting regulatory Phase III pivotal studies requirements.
 API and drug product (“DP”) registration batches have been manufactured at commercial scale in 2022 and are undergoing long-term stability monitoring throughout 2023 to 2026. We established high quality and high volume (projected up to 50,000 vials per batch) cGMPs at two separate geographical sites in anticipation of market needs.
 Phase III studies are scheduled to be initiated by the second half of 2023. 
Scilex Holding


Scilex Holding is an innovative revenue-generating company focused on acquiring, developing and commercializing non-opioid pain management products for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. The following chart illustrates the current product and product candidates for which Scilex Holding has worldwide commercialization rights, except with respect to Japan for ZTlido and SP-103 and U.S. only rights for Gloperba :
  
ZTlido
 ZTlido is a lidocaine topical system (1.8%) approved for the relief of pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia (“PHN”). PHN is a chronic neuropathic pain syndrome that results as a complication following an infection of herpes zoster, also known as shingles. Herpes zoster symptoms typically resolve after a few weeks, but the pain caused by the nerve injury can persist for months to years in the affected area. ZTlido is designed as a lighter, thinner product which has improved adhesion relative to Lidoderm (lidocaine patch 5%), while providing a bioequivalent delivery of lidocaine in an efficient drug delivery system.
We launched ZTlido in October 2018 with support from an integrated commercial organization using a dedicated contract sales force and our own sales management, marketing and managed care capabilities. We currently market ZTlido through a dedicated sales force of 60 individuals, targeting approximately 10,000 primary care physicians, pain specialists, neurologists and palliative care physicians. We are utilizing a multi-channel marketing strategy to expand awareness and utilization of ZTlido. There is coverage for ZTlido from national and regional pharmacy benefit managers, health maintenance organizations, Medicare and Medicaid plans for over approximately 200 million covered lives.
 SEMDEXA
SEMDEXA is a Phase III product candidate we are developing to be an injectable viscous gel formulation of a widely used corticosteroid designed to address the serious risks posed by off-label epidural steroid injections (“ESIs”) for the treatment of sciatica, a pathology of low back pain. We believe SEMDEXA, if successfully developed, has the potential to reduce the disability related to sciatica and help delay or avoid spine surgery. SEMDEXA has been granted fast track designation by the FDA and, if approved, could become the only FDA-approved alternative to off-label ESIs, which are administered over 12 million times annually in the United States. Enrollment for the Phase III trial was completed in the second half of 2021. We announced top-line data from this study in December 2021. The SP-102 pivotal Phase III trial 12-week data demonstrated a highly statistically significant greater effect over placebo for primary and secondary endpoints with no safety risks identified. Based on the current results, we submitted a request to the FDA for Breakthrough Therapy Designation, which will help expedite the overall development program and potential market approval. We also expect to submit a pre-NDA meeting request to the FDA in the first half of 2023.


SP-103
 SP-103 is an investigational, non-aqueous lidocaine topical system undergoing clinical development in acute low back pain conditions. SP-103 builds on the learnings from ZTlido because both products share a similar adhesive drug delivery formulation and manufacturing technology. If approved, we believe that SP-103 could become the first-in-class lidocaine topical product for low back pain indications. All current uses of topical lidocaine products for low back pain are off-label. SP-103 has three times the drug load of ZTlido (108 mg versus 36 mg) in the adhesive system to potentially deliver a threefold level of the drug within a targeted area, still with the convenience of a single topical system. Additionally, SP-103 is designed to deliver a localized dose of lidocaine that is threefold greater than any lidocaine topical product that we are aware of either on the market or in development. If approved, we believe SP-103 may be able to address the limitations of prescription lidocaine patches in treating acute low back pain by delivering a higher dose of lidocaine to the application site. We initiated the Phase II trial in the second quarter of 2022. The FDA granted fast track status in the third quarter of 2022.
 SP-104
 We are developing SP-104, a novel low-dose delayed-release naltrexone hydrochloride formulation for the treatment of fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is considered a neurosensory disorder characterized in part by abnormalities in pain processing by the central nervous system. Increased understanding of the biological bases underlying fibromyalgia is rapidly leading to a new era of specific pharmacologic therapy for the condition. Fibromyalgia affects approximately 3-6% of the adult population. There are estimated to be between 8-10 million individuals with fibromyalgia in the United States. Fibromyalgia is the second most common disorder that rheumatologists encounter, as it is seen in 15% of evaluated patients. Approximately 8% of patients cared for in primary care clinics have fibromyalgia. Women have a higher frequency of fibromyalgia. Prominent fibromyalgia researchers and specialists estimate the costs in the U.S. to be between $12-14 billion each year and it accounts for a loss of approximately 1-2% of the national overall productivity. Current FDA-approved treatments for fibromyalgia include duloxetine, pregabalin, and milnacipran. Despite the availability of these treatments, there is a large unmet need in the marketplace as these treatments have response rates of less than 50%, ranging from 27-40%. Two Phase I studies were completed and are designed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of SP-104 and the safety of SP-104 relative to the known naltrexone adverse effects. We plan to initiate a Phase II clinical trial in the first half of 2023.
 Patents and Other Proprietary Rights
 We are able to protect our technology from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that it is covered by valid and enforceable patents, is effectively maintained as a trade secret, or is protected by confidentiality agreements.

 11. The lidocaine-based pain management technology was obtained by the acquisition of Scilex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Scilex Pharma”). Certain aspects of this technology are covered by several issued U.S. patents, which will not expire until at least 2031. Additional patent applications to improvements of this technology have been filed and have the potential to provide patent coverage to at least 2039 and may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness.
12. The Sofusa technology was acquired from Kimberly-Clark Corporation (“KCC”); Kimberly-Clark Global Sales, LLC (“KCGS”); and Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc. (“KCW” and together with KCC and KCGS, “Kimberly-Clark”) in July 2018 as a novel technology platform designed to deliver large molecules, such as antibodies, directly into lymphatic capillaries and tumor draining lymph nodes. This micro-epidermal infusion system features a proprietary microneedle array and microfluidics reservoir. The Sofusa technology is the subject of multiple granted and pending applications with potential patent coverage to at least 2040.

 Certain factors can either extend patent terms or provide other forms of exclusivity (e.g., data exclusivity) for varying periods depending on the date of patent filing, date of grant or the legal term of a patent in the various jurisdictions in which patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, also depends upon the type of patent, the scope of claim coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the particular country.
 While trade secret protection is an essential element of our business and we have taken security measures to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, we cannot guarantee that our unpatented proprietary technology will afford us significant commercial protection. We seek to protect our trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, employees and consultants. Our employees and consultants also sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their interest in any intellectual

property arising from their work for us. All employees sign an agreement not to engage in any conflicting employment or activity during their employment with us and not to disclose or misuse our confidential information. However, it is possible that these agreements may be breached or invalidated and, if so, there may not be an adequate corrective remedy. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that employees, consultants or third parties will not breach the confidentiality provisions in our contracts, infringe or misappropriate our trade secrets or other proprietary rights, or that measures we are taking to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate.
 In the future, third parties may file claims asserting that our technologies or products infringe on their intellectual property. We cannot predict whether third parties will assert such claims against us or against the licensors of technology licensed to us, or whether those claims will harm our business. If we are forced to defend ourselves against such claims, whether they are with or without merit and whether they are resolved in favor of, or against, our licensors or us, we may face costly litigation and the diversion of management’s attention and resources. As a result of such disputes, we may have to develop costly non-infringing technology or enter into licensing agreements. These agreements, if necessary, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
 Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products and intellectual property. While we believe that our scientific knowledge, technology and development experience provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, some or all of which may have greater access to capital or resources than we do. For any products that we may ultimately commercialize, not only will we compete with any existing therapies and those therapies currently in development, but we will also have to compete with new therapies that may become available in the future.
 We expect that the market will become increasingly competitive in the future. Many of our competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, operate larger research and development programs, and have substantially greater commercial and financial resources than we do, as well as significantly greater experience in developing product candidates and technologies, undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of product candidates, formulating and manufacturing product candidates and launching, marketing and selling product candidates. As a result, these companies may obtain marketing approval more quickly than we are able and may be more effective in developing, selling and marketing their products.
 Immunotherapy
 Immunotherapy is an active area of research and several immune-related products have been identified in recent years that modulate the immune system. Many of these products utilize dendritic cells, a form of immune cell that presents cancer target peptides to T cells and that can in turn result in T-cell activation. More recently, bispecific antibodies and checkpoint inhibitors (for instance PD‑1/PD-L1 antibodies) have been identified as having utility in the treatment of cancer. Bi-specific antibodies commonly target both the cancer peptide and the TCR, thus bringing both cancer cells and T cells into close proximity to maximize the chance of TCR binding and hence an immune response to the cancer cells. Checkpoint inhibitors, on the other hand, work by targeting receptors that inhibit T-cell effectiveness and proliferation and thereby essentially activate T cells. Other immunotherapies that are being actively investigated include: antibody drug complexes, TCR-mimic antibodies, oncolytic viruses and cancer vaccines.
We are aware of companies developing therapies in various areas related to our specific research and development programs. Specifically, there are a growing number of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and academic institutions researching and developing autologous and allogeneic CAR-T therapies in both the solid and liquid tumor setting. These CAR-T cell therapies are at a variety of stages of preclinical, clinical development and approval. Such therapies are directed towards a broad target spectrum, including but not limited to: DLL3, EGFR, GD2, HER-2, IL13rα2, Lewis Y, L1-CAM, Mesothelin, MUC16, PSCA, PSMA and ROR1. The two approved CAR-T therapies both target CD19. We are also aware of allogeneic CAR-T programs in development.
RTX
 The pain management field in particular is a growing industry due to increased attention on opioid usage for pain, which has created a rapidly emerging market and has fueled an increased interest in opioid alternatives. Various small and early-stage companies in the non-opioid pain management field may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly if they enter into collaborative arrangements with large, established companies.
 COVID-19 Product Candidates

Neutralizing antibodies (“nAbs”): We have several nAbs either in development or in the clinic. These nAbs are directed against the COVID-19 spike protein and have varying degrees of effectiveness dependent on the VoC being targeted. The lead nAb during 2021, STI-2020, was shown to be effective in preclinical studies against the original Washington strain as well as the delta VoC. With the meteoric rise of the omicron VoC late in 2021, we identified a new highly potent nAb, STI-9167, which we initially obtained under an exclusive license from Mount Sinai and modified to be a fully-human nAb with modifications to reduce the potential for antibody-dependent enhancement or human tissue cross-reactivity. This nAb is highly effective in preclinical studies against Omicron and Omicron plus and we filed an IND early in the first quarter of 2022 to begin human safety studies of both the IV and intranasal formulations. There are several other companies which have nAbs in early development. In addition, companies that are involved in vaccine development are indirect competitors in this space, although the vaccines approved to date and known to be in development are not nAbs-based.
Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (“BTKi”): We have completed Phase II trials with Abivertinib, our dual EGFR/BTKi, to treat ARD due to COVID-19. There are several other BTKis approved for oncology conditions that could theoretically be used to treat COVID-19-induced ARD. For example, Acalabrutinib (Calquence) was used in two Phase II studies but failed to meet its primary endpoint.
 Adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal or stem cells (AdMSCs): We are currently enrolling two Phase II studies treating COVID-19-induced ARD and ARDS in the U.S. and Brazil. There are a large number of companies and universities exploring various MSCs (adipose, bone marrow, cord blood, umbilical and other sources) in Phase I and II studies to treat moderate to severe COVID-19.
Scilex Holding
 ZTlido and our product candidate, SP-103, if approved, will likely face competition from prescription, generic, and over-the-counter topical lidocaine patches, including Lidoderm and generic lidocaine patches manufactured by Teva, Mylan and Par Pharmaceutical, Inc. Additionally, SP-103, if approved, will likely compete with various opioid pain medications, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (“NSAIDs”), muscle relaxants, antidepressants and anticonvulsants, particularly as we seek approval for the treatment of acute low back pain.
 SP-102, if approved, has the potential to become the first FDA-approved epidural steroid product for the treatment of sciatica. While there are currently no FDA-approved ESIs indicated for the treatment of sciatica, Scilex Holding is aware of certain non-steroid product candidates in development. SP-102, if approved, will compete with various opioid pain medications, NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, antidepressants, anticonvulsants and surgical procedures. Procedures may include nerve blocks and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulations. We may also face indirect competition from the off-label and unapproved use of branded and generic injectable steroids.
 While there are currently no formulations containing naltrexone in clinical development for the treatment of fibromyalgia, Scilex Holding is aware of certain non-opioid therapeutics currently in a late-stage Phase III pipeline containing two 505(b)(2) development programs. Scilex’s product candidate, SP-104, will likely face direct competition from these candidates.

The key competitive factors affecting the success of ZTlido, SEMDEXA, SP-103 and SP-104 are likely to be their efficacy, durability, safety, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the U.S. (including federal, state and local authorities) and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion and export and import of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, warning letters, clinical holds, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunction, debarment and partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of the product from the market. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
U.S. Government Regulations
 In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
 •completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice regulations. Preclinical testing generally includes evaluation of our product candidates in the laboratory or in animals to characterize the product and determine safety and efficacy;
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which is required prior to conducting human clinical trials and must be updated annually;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;
 •submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for marketing approval for biological products, or an NDA for marketing approval for a new drug, after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA or an NDA to file the BLA or NDA for review;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with cGMP regulations;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of one or more of the clinical sites at which the clinical trials were conducted;
 •at the discretion of the FDA, a public Advisory Committee Meeting where the data is reviewed by experts who discuss the data and give their opinion (which the FDA is not obliged to follow) of the adequacy of the data to support an approval; and
 •FDA review and approval of a BLA or an NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the U.S.
 In addition, we are subject to regulation under state, federal and international laws and regulations regarding occupational safety, laboratory practices, import and export of materials and products, environmental protection and the use and handling of hazardous substance control, and other regulations. Our clinical trial and research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemical compounds. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our financial resources. In addition, disposal of radioactive materials used in our clinical trials and research efforts may only be made at approved facilities. We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations including those relating to the handling and disposal of hazardous and toxic waste.
 An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. The IND also includes results of animal studies or other human studies, as appropriate, as well as manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature to support the use of the investigational new drug. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trials. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical trials can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with Good Clinical Practices (“GCPs”), which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must be obtained from each clinical trial site’s institutional review board (“IRB”) before the trials may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the study until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.


The pre-approval clinical investigation of a drug is generally divided into three phases (the numbers of subjects/patients are approximate and vary from indication to indication). Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The three phases of an investigation are as follows:
 •Phase I. Phase I includes the initial introduction of an investigational new drug into humans. Phase I clinical trials are typically closely monitored and may be conducted in patients with the target disease or condition or in healthy volunteers. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase I clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational drug’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase II clinical trials. The total number of participants included in Phase I clinical trials varies, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80.
 •Phase II. Phase II includes controlled clinical trials conducted to preliminarily or further evaluate the effectiveness of the investigational drug for a particular indication(s) in patients with the disease or condition under study, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the drug. Phase II clinical trials are typically well-controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a limited patient population, usually involving no more than several hundred participants.
 •Phase III. Phase III clinical trials are generally controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded patient population generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. Phase III clinical trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand participants. In general, two Phase III trials are needed for an approval.
 A pivotal trial is a clinical trial that adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidate’s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the product. Generally, pivotal trials are also Phase III trials but may be Phase II trials if the trial design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need.
 The FDA, the IRB or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the study. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA or an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications.
 The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA.
 Once the BLA or NDA submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review applications within ten months of submission or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months from submission. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations.
 During the evaluation of the BLA or NDA, the FDA conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its API will be produced and some of the clinical sites that conducted the trials, and it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, an additional pivotal Phase III clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or

manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA or NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA could also approve the BLA or NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (“REMS”) plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase IV clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Regulatory approval of oncology products often requires that patients in clinical trials be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug.
 After regulatory approval of a drug product is obtained, we are required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements. As a holder of an approved BLA or NDA, we would be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of our products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval to ensure and preserve the long term stability of the drug product. The FDA periodically (about every two years) inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive and record keeping requirements. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production, distribution, shipping and storage of clinical and commercial quantities of our product candidates. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA or NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development.
 Europe/Rest of World Government Regulations
 In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products.
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the U.S. have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application (“CTA”) must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed.
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the NDA in the U.S. is similar to that required in Europe, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.


Available Special Regulatory Procedures
 Formal Meetings
 We can engage and seek guidance from health authorities relating to the development and review of investigational drugs, as well as marketing applications. In the U.S., there are different types of official meetings that may occur between us and the FDA. Each meeting type is subject to different procedures. Conclusions and agreements from each of these meetings are captured in the official final meeting minutes issued by the FDA. Meetings with the FDA are free.
 The European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) also provides the opportunity for dialogue with us. This is usually done in the form of Scientific Advice, which is given by the Scientific Advice Working Party of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”). A fee is incurred with each Scientific Advice meeting.
 Advice from either the FDA or EMA is typically provided based on specific questions concerning, for example, quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical trials and pharmaco-vigilance plans and risk-management programs. Such advice is not legally binding on the sponsor. To obtain binding commitments from health authorities in the U.S. and the European Union, Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”) or Protocol Assistance procedures are available. An SPA is an evaluation by the FDA of a protocol with the goal of reaching an agreement with the sponsor that the protocol design, clinical endpoints and statistical analyses are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the product candidate with respect to effectiveness in the indication studied. The FDA’s agreement to an SPA is binding upon the FDA except in limited circumstances, such as if the FDA identifies a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the product after clinical trials begin, or if the trial sponsor fails to follow the protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA. There is no guarantee that a trial will ultimately be adequate to support an approval even if the trial is subject to an SPA.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or, if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. In the European Union, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union Community. Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug or biological product.
 In the U.S., orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of 7 years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity.
 In the European Union, orphan drug designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following drug or biological product approval. This period may be reduced to 6 years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
 Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 Authorization Procedures in the European Union
 Medicines can be authorized in the European Union by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.
 •Centralized procedure. The EMA implemented the centralized procedure for the approval of human medicines to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the European Union. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization issued by the EMA that is valid across the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are: derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as 


HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and officially designated orphan medicines.
 •For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health.
 •National authorization procedures. There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several countries, which are available for investigational drug products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
 •Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any European Union country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
 •Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other European Union countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
 Priority Review/Standard Review (U.S.) and Accelerated Review (European Union)
 Based on results of the Phase III clinical trial(s) submitted in a BLA or NDA, upon the request of an applicant, the FDA may grant the BLA or NDA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months. Priority review is granted where preliminary estimates indicate that a product, if approved, has the potential to provide a safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists, or a significant improvement compared to marketed products is possible. If criteria are not met for priority review, the BLA or NDA is subject to the standard FDA review period of 10 months. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 Under the Centralized Procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, which is defined by three cumulative criteria: (i) the seriousness of the disease (e.g., heavy disabling or life-threatening diseases) to be treated; (ii) the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and (iii) anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days, excluding clock stops.
 There can be no assurance that we or any of our partners would be able to satisfy one or more of these requirements to conduct preclinical or clinical trials or receive any regulatory approvals.
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S. and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 In 2003, the U.S. government enacted legislation providing a partial prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries, which became effective at the beginning of 2006. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, to obtain payments under this program, we would be required to sell products to Medicare recipients through prescription drug plans operating pursuant to this legislation. These plans will likely negotiate discounted prices for our products. Further, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and

Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “Healthcare Reform Law”), substantially changed the way healthcare is financed in the U.S. by both government and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, the Healthcare Reform Law established:
 •An annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents;
 •A new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program in which pharmaceutical manufacturers who wish to have their drugs covered under Part D must offer discounts to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period (the “donut hole”); and
 •A new formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
 In addition, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other things, includes policies that are designed to have a direct impact on drug prices and reduce drug spending by the federal government, which shall take effect in 2023. Under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, Congress authorized Medicare beginning in 2026 to negotiate lower prices for certain costly single-source drug and biologic products that do not have competing generics or biosimilars. This provision is limited in terms of the number of pharmaceuticals whose prices can be negotiated in any given year and it only applies to drug products that have been approved for at least 9 years and biologics that have been licensed for 13 years. Drugs and biologics that have been approved for a single rare disease or condition are categorically excluded from price negotiation. Further, the new legislation provides that if pharmaceutical companies raise prices in Medicare faster than the rate of inflation, they must pay rebates back to the government for the difference. The new law also caps Medicare out-of-pocket drug costs at an estimated $4,000 a year in 2024 and, thereafter beginning in 2025, at $2,000 a year.
We expect that federal, state and local governments in the U.S. will continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Future legislation could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the drug candidates that we are developing.
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed upon. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. For example, in the U.S., there are federal and state anti-kickback laws that prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of healthcare products and services or reward past purchases or recommendations. Violations of these laws can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was broadened by the Healthcare Reform Law, which, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b, effective March 23, 2010. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent

claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The “qui tam” provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government and to share in any monetary recovery. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not merely a federal healthcare program. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of $11,803 to $23,607 (each subject to adjustment for inflation) for each separate false claim.
 Also, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud, and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services.
 In addition, we may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which established uniform standards for certain “covered entities” (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) and their business associates governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information.
 Antibody Clinical Development
 We currently focus our research efforts primarily on the identification and isolation of human antibody drug candidates and further characterize these antibody candidates in in vitro and in vivo functional testing. Due to our limited financial resources, we intend to actively seek product development and commercialization partners from the biopharmaceutical industry to help us advance the clinical development of select product candidates.
Marketing and Sales
 With the exception of our subsidiary, Scilex Holding, we currently do not have any sales capabilities. We intend to license to, or enter into strategic alliances with, larger companies in the biopharmaceutical businesses or use the services of contract sales organizations, which are equipped to market and/or sell our products, if any, through their well-developed marketing and sales teams and distribution networks. We intend to license some or all of our worldwide patent rights to more than one third party to achieve the fullest development, marketing and distribution of any products we develop.
Manufacturing and Raw Materials
 We currently manufacture the majority of our preclinical and clinical materials in-house, and use contract manufacturers for the manufacture of some of our product candidates. We may or may not manufacture the products we develop, if any. As of December 31, 2021, our ZTlido product is manufactured by ITOCHU CHEMICAL FRONTIER Corporation. Our internal manufacturing and contract manufacturers are subject to extensive governmental regulation. Regulatory authorities in our markets require that pharmaceutical products be manufactured, packaged and labeled in conformity with cGMPs. We have established a quality control and quality assurance program, which includes a set of standard operating procedures and specifications designed to ensure that our products are manufactured in accordance with cGMPs, and other applicable domestic and foreign regulations.
Employees and Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 949 employees and 8 consultants and advisors. A significant number of our management and our other employees and consultants have worked or consulted with pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical product companies. While we have been successful in attracting skilled and experienced scientific personnel, there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain the necessary qualified employees and/or consultants in the future.
 None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider relations with our employees to be good. We focus on identifying, recruiting, developing and retaining a team of highly talented and motivated employees. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and

cash-based compensation awards, as well as providing our employees with the opportunity to participate in our employee stock purchase plan, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives. The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being, health and safety of our employees. In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, we took proactive action from the earliest signs of the COVID-19 outbreak, which included implementing social distancing policies at our facilities, facilitating remote working arrangements and imposing employee travel restrictions.
 Corporate Information
 On September 21, 2009, QuikByte Software, Inc., a Colorado corporation and shell company (“QuikByte”), consummated its acquisition of Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation and private concern (“STI”), in a reverse merger (the “Merger”).
 We were originally incorporated as San Diego Antibody Company in California in 2006 and were renamed “Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc.” and reincorporated in Delaware in 2009, prior to the Merger. QuikByte was originally incorporated in Colorado in 1989. Following the Merger, on December 4, 2009, QuikByte reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware (the “Reincorporation”). Immediately following the Reincorporation, on December 4, 2009, we merged with and into QuikByte, the separate corporate existence of STI ceased and QuikByte continued as the surviving corporation (the “Roll-Up Merger”). Pursuant to the certificate of merger filed in connection with the Roll-Up Merger, QuikByte’s name was changed from “QuikByte Software, Inc.” to “Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc.”
