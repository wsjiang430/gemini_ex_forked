Item 1. Business
Background and Overview
 
PAVmed is a highly differentiated, multi-product, commercial-stage medical technology company organized to advance a broad pipeline of innovative medical technologies from concept to commercialization, employing a business model focused on capital efficiency and speed to market.
 
Our current central focus is predominantly on commercial expansion and execution including the acceleration of EsoGuard and Veris Cancer Care Platform commercialization. As resources permit, we will continue to explore internal and external innovations that fulfill our project selection criteria without limiting ourselves to any target specialty or condition. More broadly, we strive to maintain balance within our pipeline with shorter-term, lower-risk projects with the prospect for rapid commercialization and revenue generation supporting development of longer-term projects. At the same time, we are continuously re-assessing each project’s long-term commercial potential relative to other projects in our pipeline, accelerating or decelerating the project and reallocating resources accordingly.
 
The Company operates in one segment as a medical technology company, with the following lines of business: Diagnostics, Medical Devices and Digital Health. Below is a summary of each of our key products within these sectors, including in particular EsoGuard and the Veris Cancer Care Platform, currently our two leading products. We are also pursuing a number of research and development project and product opportunities across these three lines of business, which have either been developed internally or have been presented to us by clinician innovators and academic medical institutions for consideration.
 
EsoGuard and EsoCheck
 
We believe that the flagship product of our majority-owned subsidiary Lucid Diagnostics Inc. (Nasdaq: LUCD) (“Lucid”), the EsoGuard Esophageal DNA Test, performed on samples collected with the EsoCheck Esophageal Cell Collection Device, constitutes the first and only commercially available diagnostic test capable of serving as a widespread screening tool to prevent esophageal adenocarcinoma (“EAC”) deaths, through early detection of esophageal precancer in at-risk gastroesophageal reflux disease (“GERD,” also commonly known as chronic heartburn, acid reflux or simply reflux) patients.
 
EsoGuard is a bisulfite-converted next-generation sequencing (NGS) DNA assay performed on surface esophageal cells collected with EsoCheck. It quantifies methylation at 31 sites on two genes, Vimentin (VIM) and Cyclin A1 (CCNA1). The assay was evaluated in a 408-patient multicenter case-control study published in Science Translational Medicine and showed greater than 90% sensitivity and specificity at detecting esophageal precancer and all conditions along the BE-EAC spectrum, including on samples collected with EsoCheck (Moinova, et al. Sci Transl Med. 2018 Jan 17;10(424): eaao5848). EsoGuard is commercially available in the U.S. as a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) performed at our CLIA-certified laboratory. Cell samples, including those collected with EsoCheck, as discussed below, are sent to our laboratory for testing and analyses using our proprietary EsoGuard NGS DNA assay.
 
EsoCheck is an FDA 510(k) and CE Mark cleared noninvasive swallowable balloon capsule catheter device capable of sampling surface esophageal cells in a less than five-minute office procedure. It consists of a vitamin pill-sized rigid plastic capsule tethered to a thin silicone catheter from which a soft silicone balloon with textured ridges emerges to gently swab surface esophageal cells. When vacuum suction is applied, the balloon and sampled cells are pulled into the capsule, protecting them from contamination and dilution by cells outside of the targeted region during device withdrawal. We believe this proprietary Collect+Protect™ technology makes EsoCheck the only noninvasive esophageal cell collection device capable of such anatomically targeted and protected sampling.
 
EsoGuard and EsoCheck are based on patented technology licensed by Lucid from Case Western Reserve University (“CWRU”). EsoGuard and EsoCheck have been developed to provide an accurate, non-invasive, patient-friendly screening test for the early detection of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus (“EAC”) and Barrett’s Esophagus (“BE”), including dysplastic BE and related pre-cursors to EAC in patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux (“GERD”).
 
Market Opportunity
 
In 2023, approximately 20,000 U.S. GERD patients are projected to be diagnosed with EAC and approximately 16,000 will die from it. Over 80% of EAC patients will die within five years of diagnosis, making it the second most lethal cancer in the U.S. The U.S. incidence of EAC has increased 500% over the past four decades, while the incidences of other common cancers have declined or remained flat. In nearly all cases, EAC silently progresses until it manifests itself with new symptoms of advanced disease. EAC is nearly always invasive at diagnosis, and, unlike other common cancers, mortality rates are high even in its earlier stages.
 
As discussed below under the heading “Clinical Guidelines for At-Risk Population”, the American Gastroenterology Association (“AGA”) recently significantly expanded the target population for esophageal precancer screening, recommending screening in at-risk patients without symptoms of GERD. Based on this revision, we believe the cohort recommended for screening consists of an estimated 30 million U.S. individuals with at least 3 established risk factors for BE. Accordingly, we believe EsoGuard’s total addressable U.S. market opportunity exceeds $60 billion based on an effective Medicare payment of $1,938 and the estimated 30 million U.S. patients recommended for screening by clinical practice guidelines. (In December 2019, we secured “gapfill” determination for EsoGuard’s PLA code 0114U through the CMS CLFS process. This allowed us to engage directly with Medicare contractor Palmetto GBA and its MolDx Program on CMS payment and coverage. In October 2020, CMS granted EsoGuard final Medicare payment determination of $1,938.01, effective January 1, 2021.)

Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, less than 10% of at-risk patients who are recommended for screening undergo traditional invasive upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (EGD). We believe that the profound tragedy of an EAC diagnosis is that likely death could have been prevented if the at-risk patient had been screened and then undergone surveillance and curative endoscopic esophageal ablation of dysplastic BE.
 
Since mortality rates are high even in early stage EAC, preventing EAC deaths requires detection and intervention at the precancer stage. Most of the necessary elements for such an early detection program are already well established—an at-risk population (at-risk GERD patients), a precancer (BE), and an intervention which can halt progression to EAC (endoscopic esophageal ablation). The only missing element for such an early detection program is a widespread screening tool that can detect BE prior to EAC.
 
We believe EsoGuard, used with EsoCheck, constitutes that missing element—the first and only commercially available diagnostic test capable of serving as a widespread screening tool to prevent EAC deaths through early detection of esophageal precancer and cancer in patients with 3 or more risk factors.
 
Clinical Guidelines for At-Risk Population
 
The subgroup of long-standing or severe GERD patients at-risk for BE and progression to EAC is well defined in clinical practice guidelines, including the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) BE Guidelines. In its Recommendation 5, the ACG suggests a single screening endoscopy in patients with chronic GERD symptoms and 3 or more additional risk factors for BE, including male sex, age greater than 50 years, White race, tobacco smoking, obesity, and family history of BE or EAC in a first-degree relative.
 
An ACG clinical guideline entitled “Diagnosis and Management of Barrett’s Esophagus: An Updated ACG Guideline,” the first such update since 2016, was published online last year in the American Journal of Gastroenterology. The clinical guideline reiterates the ACG’s long-standing recommendation for esophageal precancer screening in at-risk patients with GERD. For the first time, however, the clinical guideline also endorses nonendoscopic biomarker screening as an acceptable alternative to costly and invasive endoscopy stating that “a swallowable nonendoscopic capsule device combined with a biomarker is an acceptable alternative to endoscopy for BE.” The clinical guideline specifically mentions EsoCheck, along with Lucid’s EsophaCap® device, as such swallowable, nonendoscopic esophageal cell collection devices, as well as methylated DNA biomarkers such as EsoGuard. The summary of evidence for this recommendation includes a reference to the seminal NIH-funded, multicenter, case-control study published in 2018 in Science Translational Medicine, which demonstrated that EsoGuard is highly accurate at detecting esophageal precancer and cancer, including on samples collected with EsoCheck.
 
In July 2022, the AGA published in their “Clinical Practice Update on New Technology and Innovation for Surveillance and Screening in Barrett’s Esophagus” updated clinical guidance that mirrors the same furnished by the ACG as described above, endorsing the use of non-endoscopic cell collection tools to screen for BE like our EsoCheck Cell Collection Device, which is cited in the update, as an acceptable alternative to endoscopy to directly address the need for noninvasive screening tools that are easy to administer, patient friendly, and cost-effective for the detection of BE. The clinical practice update by the AGA also significantly expands the target population for esophageal precancer screening, including for EsoGuard and EsoCheck, by recommending, for the first time, screening in at-risk patients without symptoms of GERD. The AGA does so by adding a history of chronic GERD as merely an additional, seventh risk factor to the six risk factors for BE and EAC that have traditionally identified at-risk symptomatic patients recommended for screening.
 
Commercialization
 
Our EsoGuard commercialization efforts span multiple channels including targeting primary care physicians and GI physicians, who have generally embraced our message that EsoGuard has the potential to expand the funnel of BE-EAC patients who will need long term EGD surveillance and, potentially, treatment with endoscopic esophageal ablation.
 
To assure sufficient testing capacity and geographic coverage, we have built our own network of Lucid Test Centers, staffed by Lucid-employed clinical personnel, where patients can undergo the EsoCheck procedure and have the sample sent for EsoGuard testing at Lucid’s CLIA-certified laboratory. Our current test center network currently includes locations in metropolitan areas in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Texas and Utah.
 
In addition to our base test center network, Lucid has established a satellite test center program, whereby we are expanding our footprint by making our personnel available to perform cell collection services in physician offices. Further, we have sought to expand our outreach by successfully conducting multiple “#CheckYourFoodTube Precancer Testing Event” for organizations such as the San Antonio Fire Department, where samples are collected from the organization’s employees for testing with EsoGuard at Lucid’s CLIA-certified laboratory.
 
We have also established an EsoGuard Telemedicine Program, in partnership with UpScript, LLC, an independent third-party telemedicine provider, that accommodates EsoGuard self-referrals from direct-to-consumer marketing.
 
Reimbursement and Market Access
 
As noted above, in December 2019, we secured “gapfill” determination for EsoGuard’s PLA code 0114U through the CMS CLFS process. This allowed us to engage directly with Medicare contractor Palmetto GBA and its MolDx Program on CMS payment and coverage. In October 2020, CMS granted EsoGuard final Medicare payment determination of $1,938.01, effective January 1, 2021.

A proposed Local Coverage Determination (“LCD”) DL39256, entitled “Molecular Testing for Detection of Upper Gastrointestinal Metaplasia, Dysplasia, and Neoplasia” was published recently on the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) website by MAC Palmetto GBA. The proposed LCD is a further step in Lucid’s efforts to secure Medicare coverage and payment for EsoGuard. The proposed LCD, which the CMS website explicitly characterizes as a “work in progress” for “public review,” outlines criteria that MolDX expects upper gastrointestinal precancer and cancer molecular diagnostic tests to meet. These criteria include active GERD with at least two risk factors, as well as evidence of analytic validity, clinical validity, and clinical utility. Although the proposed LCD indicated that it found that no currently existing test has fulfilled all criteria, it indicated that it will “monitor the evidence and will provide coverage based on the pertinent literature and society recommendations.” Notably, the proposed LCD pre-dated, and therefore does not include consideration of, the most recent AGA clinical practice update endorsing swallowable, nonendoscopic capsule devices combined with a biomarker, such as EsoCheck and EsoGuard, as an alternative to endoscopy. The publication of the proposed LCD triggers a written comment period, and MolDX also held an open meeting on May 10, 2022, during which stakeholders and other interested parties will have the opportunity to address the proposed LCD. We presented at the public meeting and made a written submission during the comment period as well. A final LCD will not be issued until the MAC has had the opportunity to assess and consider all stakeholder comments.
 
While we await a Palmetto MolDX LCD coverage determination, Lucid is aggressively pursuing EsoGuard commercial insurer payment and coverage. Although the claim adjudication cycle can be prolonged during the early commercialization of a new test, Lucid has received out-of-network commercial insurance payments for the EsoGuard test, and has entered into agreements with insurers that provide access to, in the aggregate, over 70 million patients.
 
Clinical Utility and Clinical Trials
 
Demonstrating EsoGuard’s clinical utility, which requires providing evidence that the test has a meaningful impact on clinical practice, is very important for a variety of purposes, including, importantly, for Medicare and private payor payment and coverage. It has been established that one of the most important factors to private payors in deciding whether to grant payment and coverage will be demonstration that the EsoGuard test, when ordered by physicians, provides information that can be used to identify or exclude patients who would benefit from additional management and/or treatment. Clinical utility studies are also important for general EsoGuard commercialization by facilitating physician understanding of test indications and potential benefit to the patients.
 
We are currently seeking to accelerate our collection of clinical utility data through a range of trials that can be efficiently executed. These efforts include a planned investigator-initiated, retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data on the approximately 400 San Antonio fire fighters who underwent testing as part of a community-sponsored cancer awareness event (in respect of which we expect to publish results in the first half of 2023); an ongoing investigator-initiated, retrospective, single-center, study with 500 patients (in respect of which we expect to publish results mid-2023), a virtual-patient randomized controlled trial with intended recruitment of 100-200 physician participants (in respect of which we expect to publish results this year); a Lucid-sponsored multi-center, prospective, observational study with 500 patients; and a Lucid-sponsored registry at existing Lucid Test Centers, whereby all patients undergoing EsoCheck testing will be given the opportunity to provide informed consent and contribute data about their risk factors, EsoGuard results, and subsequent diagnostic and/or therapeutic journey. Both Lucid-sponsored observational/registry studies expect to have preliminary results and/or interim analysis before the end of 2023.
 
As previously disclosed, consequently, we have decided to delay for the time being the two previously commenced clinical trials, the “EsoGuard screening study” (“BE-1”) and the “EsoGuard case-control study” (“BE-2”), as we are devoting our clinical resources to the studies cited above, which we expect will more efficiently generate the clinical data we are currently prioritizing to drive EsoGuard commercialization.
 
Manufacturing
 
EsoCheck is currently manufactured for us by our partners Coastline International, a high-volume device manufacturer, and Sage Product Development. Through mid-2023, we expect to further transition from Sage to Coastline as the manufacturing process is further optimized. Our current line capacity can produce up to 25,000 units per year. With Coastline’s improvement and expansion, there is capacity to scale exponentially. Our EsoGuard Specimen Kits are currently manufactured for us by our partner Path-Tec. The warehousing, logistics, fulfillment and customer support of our products is managed for us by our partners HealthLink International (a leading third-party logistics company) and Path-Tec.
License Agreement
 
Under the terms of Lucid’s license agreement with Case Western Reserve University (“CWRU”), Lucid acquired an exclusive worldwide right to use the intellectual property rights to the EsoGuard and EsoCheck technology for the detection of changes in the esophagus and on sample preservation. Lucid is required to pay CWRU royalties on net sales of licensed products as follows: 5% of net sales of less than $100 million per year; and 8% of net sales greater than $100 million per year. Lucid is also required to pay CWRU minimum annual royalty payments as follows: $50,000 per year, beginning January 1 following the first anniversary of a commercial sale of a licensed product; $150,000 per year, if net sales of a licensed product exceed $25 million in a year; $300,000 per year, if net sales of a licensed product exceed $50 million in a year; and $600,000 per year, if net sales of a licensed product exceed $100 million in a year. Minimum yearly royalty amounts are subject to increase based on the percentage change in the CPI-W Consumer Price Index and are credited against the royalties otherwise due. The license agreement was subject to four regulatory and commercialization milestones, of which one remains unachieved and unpaid. The remaining milestone is the FDA PMA submission of a licensed product, upon the achievement of which we will pay CWRU a milestone payment of $200,000. The license agreement terminates upon the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent, or on May 12, 2038, in countries where no such patents exist, or upon expiration of any exclusive marketing rights for a licensed product that have been granted by FDA or other U.S. government agency, whichever comes later. The EsoCheck patents, which are currently the last to expire, begin to expire in May 2035.

Regulatory
 
In June 2019, we received FDA 510(k) clearance to market EsoCheck in the U.S. as a device indicated for use in the collection and retrieval of surface cells of the esophagus in adults followed by FDA 510(k) clearance in 2022, expanding the use of EsoCheck in adults and pediatric populations in the U.S. In December 2019, our CLIA-certified then-laboratory partner, completed documentation of EsoGuard analytical validity allowing us to commercialize it as a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT).
 
In February 2020, we received FDA “Breakthrough Device Designation” for EsoGuard as an in-vitro diagnostic (“IVD”) medical device. The FDA Breakthrough Device Program was created to offer patients more timely access to breakthrough technologies which provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating human disease or conditions by expediting their development, assessment and review through enhanced communications and more efficient and flexible clinical study design, including more favorable pre/post market data collection balance. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the United States Congress continue to work to provide an expedited coverage pathway for emerging technologies.
 
In May 2021, we received CE Mark certification for EsoCheck (under the Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC), and in June 2021, we completed CE Mark self-certification for EsoGuard (under the European In-Vitro Diagnostic Devices Directive (IVDD 98/79/EC)), indicating both may be marketed in CE Mark European countries.
 
Our longer-term strategy is to secure a specific indication, based on published guidelines, for BE screening in certain at-risk populations using EsoGuard on samples collected with EsoCheck. This use of EsoGuard together with EsoCheck as a screening system must be cleared or approved by the FDA as an IVD device.
 
Laboratory Operations
 
On February 25, 2022, our new, wholly owned subsidiary, LucidDx Labs Inc. (“LucidDx Labs”), acquired from RDx, certain licenses and other related assets necessary for LucidDx Labs to operate its own new CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited clinical laboratory located in Lake Forest, CA. Since March 2022, we have conducted EsoGuard testing at our own laboratory with, until recently, the assistance of RDx, which had continued to provide certain testing and related services for the laboratory in accordance with the terms of a management services agreement (“MSA-RDx”), dated and effective February 25, 2022. Recently, however, the Company accelerated the development of internal resources necessary to operate the laboratory entirely on its own. Accordingly, Lucid’s subsidiary LucidDx Labs and RDx agreed terminate the MSA-RDx effective as of February 10, 2023, such that LucidDx Labs now operates the laboratory itself, which the Company believes will improve the efficiency of the performance of the EsoGuard assay.
Competition
 
The U.S. market for esophageal cancer (i.e., EAC) and pre-cancer (i.e., BE, with or without dysplasia) screening is large, consisting of more than 30 million at-risk individuals over the age of 50. Given the large market for pre-cancer screening, we likely will face numerous competitors, some of which possess significantly greater financial and other resources and development capabilities than us. Our EsoGuard test faces competition from procedure-based detection technologies such as upper endoscopy, and other screening technologies such as multi-cancer early detection products. Our EsoCheck device faces competition from other manufactures with devices designed to collect cell samples from targeted regions of the esophagus. For example, Cytosponge is a small mesh sponge within a soluble gelatin capsule that dissolves in the stomach and then is pulled thru the targeted region brushing the lining of the esophagus and then later retrieved, although, unlike EsoCheck, it is unprotected from contamination. Our competitors may also be developing additional methods of detecting esophageal cancer and pre-cancer that have not yet been announced.
 
Accordingly, the market for our products is highly competitive and is characterized by extensive research and clinical efforts and rapid technological change. In order to compete effectively, EsoGuard and EsoCheck will have to achieve market acceptance, receive adequate insurance coverage and reimbursement, be cost effective and be simultaneously safe and effective. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets are:
 

● | diagnostic accuracy and the quality of outcomes for medical conditions;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | acceptance by physicians and the medical device market generally; 
● | ease of use and reliability; 
● | technical leadership and superiority; 
● | effective marketing and distribution; 
● | speed to market; and 
● | product price and qualification for coverage and reimbursement. 

 
Most of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, sales, distribution, manufacturing and technological resources. We may be unable to compete effectively against our competitors either because their products and services are superior or more cost efficient, or because of they have access to greater resources than us. These competitors may have greater name recognition than we do. Many of these competitors have obtained all desirable FDA or other regulatory approvals, and superior patent protection, for their products. Certain of our competitors have already commercialized their products, and others may commercialize their products in advance of our products. In addition, our competitors may make technical advances that render our products obsolete. We may be unable to respond to such technical advances.

Veris Cancer Care Platform
 
Overview
 
In May 2021, we formed Veris Health, a majority-owned subsidiary, focused on digital health technology. In connection with its formation, Veris Health acquired Oncodisc, a digital health company with groundbreaking tools to improve personalized cancer care through remote patient monitoring. Oncodisc’s core technologies include the first intelligent implantable vascular access port with biologic sensors and wireless communication, combined with an oncologist-designed remote digital healthcare platform that provides patients and physicians with new tools to improve outcomes and optimize the delivery of cost-effective care through remote monitoring and data analytics.
 
Oncodisc was founded in 2018 experienced physician entrepreneurs, James Mitchell, M.D., who joined Veris Health as its full-time Chief Medical Officer, and Andrew Thoreson, M.D., who serves as a Veris Health consultant. They previously co-founded Redsmith, Inc., an interventional catheter company whose technology was acquired by C.R. Bard Inc., now BD Inc. (NYSE: BDX). Oncodisc received a National Science Foundation (“NSF”) Small Business Innovation Research (“SBIR”) grant award to support its early work and completed both the MedTech Innovator Accelerator and UCSF Rosenman Institute Accelerator programs.
 
The Veris Cancer Care Platform (“CCP”) is a digital cancer care platform with physiologic data collection, symptom reporting and telehealth functions, designed to improve personalized cancer care through remote patient monitoring. Cancer patients enrolled in the Veris CCP receive a VerisBox™ with Veris-branded Bluetooth enabled connected health care devices. The devices transmit clinical data to cancer care teams to detect early signs of common cancer-related complications, provide longitudinal trends of physiologic and clinical data, and offer data-driven risk management tools for precision oncology. Veris CCP integrates directly with practices’ and systems’ Electronic Health Record (“EHR”) systems, allowing care teams to easily view and interact with this data. We are also currently developing a groundbreaking implantable physiologic monitor containing biologic sensors capable of generating continuous data on key physiologic parameters known to predict adverse outcomes in cancer patients undergoing treatment. The implantable will seamlessly interact with the Veris CCP. These technologies are the subject of multiple patent applications and one issued patent.
 
Veris Health leverages a business-to-business sales model. Its software-as-a-service recurring-revenue business model seeks to generate 100% recurring revenue through oncology practice and hospital-based subscriptions. These entities pay monthly fees for each patient on the platform, through which they are able to drive revenues from remote physiologic monitoring (and, in the future, device implantation) under existing CPT codes, as well as through the upcoming CMS Enhancing Oncology Model (EOM) bonuses and incentives. Veris also plans to build a commercialization model around the oncology data it is collecting. We have identified multiple potential use cases across a number of verticals, including clinical trials, commercial use cases, and as a means to improve patient care.
 
In addition to targeting the oncology market, Veris plans to expand into the hospital-at-home market, cardiovascular diseases, end-stage renal disease, and lung disorders like COPD. We have already initiated R&D efforts around an enhanced implantable cardiac monitor capable of detecting cardiac arrhythmias and other physiologic parameters critical for high-risk cardiac patients. Future devices will combine novel sensing technology with seamless communication, engaging user interface design, and data analytics driving actionable clinical insights for patients with congestive heart failure. These technologies will then be expanded for high-risk kidney disease and pulmonary patients.
 
Market Opportunity
 
In 2022, approximately 1.9 million people in the U.S. were newly diagnosed with cancer, and cancer incidence in the U.S. is expected to continue to increase. Cancer patients face high rates of complications during the courses of their treatment which drive poor patient outcomes and healthcare costs. One driver of these issues is avoidable hospitalizations. We believe Veris Health’s offerings can help drive costs down and improve outcomes through providing care teams with better, more continuous data.
 
Based on the aforementioned cancer prevalence in the U.S. and our current business model, we believe Veris Health’s total addressable U.S. market opportunity exceeds $2 billion. In the future, we believe this opportunity will only expand through the implantable physiologic monitor, data commercialization, and the expansion into other markets aside from oncology.
 
Commercialization/Sales
 
Our Veris commercialization efforts have targeted the full spectrum of oncology care providers, with a focus on independent oncology practices, participants in CMS’s Oncology Care Model (OCM) and EOM, and innovative, progressive health systems. The growing adoption of value-based models has provided a strong tailwind, as the Veris CCP addresses many requirements of these programs, including electronic Patient Reported Outcomes (“ePROs”) and the use of data for quality improvement.
 
Manufacturing
 
The components comprising the Veris Cancer Care Platform are currently supplied to us by our partners TransTek and their U.S.-based subsidiary, Mio Labs. Each has passed a SOC-2 audit by an outside auditor. The final packaging of the overall box and order fulfillment is managed by Impilo, a partner with TransTek and Mio Labs. The customer support is currently managed internally, while partnering with Zendesk for customer service management.

Regulatory
 
The Veris CCP software is considered a non-device Medical Device Data System (“MDDS”) that is excluded from the statutory definition of a medical device under the FDC Act and as confirmed in the FDA’s MDDS Guidance: Medical Device Data Systems, Medical Image Storage Devices, and Medical Image Communications Devices. Therefore, Veris CCP is not subject to the FDA’s regulatory requirements for devices.
 
Veris Health is also developing an implantable cardiac monitor and is currently interacting with the FDA via pre-submission process, seeking agreement on regulatory strategy and required testing to seek clearance of the monitor. We current plan to make our 510(k) submission for the implantable monitor in late 2023.
 
As Veris Health is currently sourcing the devices included in the VerisBox™ from the third-party 510(k) holders for those products, such holders are responsible for any losses, damages, claims or other liabilities that may arise with respect to those devices used with the Veris CCP software, notwithstanding Veris Health commercial branding being added to the devices or the devices’ packaging.
 
Competition
 
The U.S. market for cancer patient care is large. There are many existing competitors in the remote patient monitoring space, some of which possess significantly greater financial and other resources and development capabilities than us. Our Veris CCP faces competition from other digital care platforms providing many of the same features, including EHR integration and remote patient monitoring capabilities. While we are not aware of other implantable physiologic monitors containing biologic sensors, our competitors may also be developing similar devices that have not yet been announced.
Product Pipeline
 
Below is a summary of certain of the other leading products within our development pipeline. While we currently are devoting substantially all of our resources to the acceleration of EsoGuard and Veris Cancer Care Platform commercialization, as resources permit, we will continue to explore innovative technologies, such as our EsoCure, CarpX and NextFlo products as more fully described below, that fulfill our project selection criteria without limiting ourselves to any target specialty or condition.
Esocure
 
In connection with our efforts to expand our presence in the EAC diagnostic market, we are also developing the EsoCure Esophageal Ablation Device, with the intent to allow a clinician to treat dysplastic BE before it can progress to EAC, a highly lethal esophageal cancer, and to do so without the need for complex and expensive capital equipment. We have successfully completed a pre-clinical feasibility animal study of EsoCure demonstrating excellent, controlled circumferential ablation of the esophageal mucosal lining. An acute and survival animal study of EsoCure Esophageal Ablation Device has also been completed, demonstrating successful direct thermal balloon catheter ablation of esophageal lining through the working channel of a standard endoscope. When resources permit, we plan to conduct additional development work and animal testing of EsoCure to support a future FDA 510(k) submission.
 
CarpX
 
CarpX is a patented, single-use, disposable, minimally invasive surgical device for use in the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome. We believe CarpX is designed to allow the physician to relieve the compression on the median nerve without an open incision or the need for endoscopic or other imaging equipment, and therefore will be significantly less invasive than existing treatments. To use CarpX, the operator first advances a guidewire through the carpal tunnel under the ligament, and then advanced over the wire and positioned in the carpal tunnel under ultrasonic and/or fluoroscopic guidance. When the CarpX balloon is inflated it creates tension in the ligament positioning the cutting electrodes underneath it and creates space within the tunnel, providing anatomic separation between the target ligament and critical structures such as the median nerve. Radiofrequency energy is briefly delivered to the electrodes, rapidly cutting the ligament, and relieving the pressure on the nerve. We believe CarpX will be significantly less invasive than existing treatments.
 
CarpX received FDA 510(k) marketing clearance in April 2020, with the first commercial procedure successfully performed in December 2020. In May 2021 European CE Mark Certification was received for CarpX. Our limited-release commercialization efforts through 2022 were focused on engaging key opinion hand surgeons designed to solicit input for ergonomic improvements to the device, procedure development and surgical-time optimization, and ease of use. As a result of this clinical input, we have initiated a product development project to incorporate intraluminal ultrasound into the device to include real time imaging of the ligament to be cut together with critical anatomic structures, and will continue to pursue that project, as resources permit.
 
PortIO
 
Our PortIO implantable intraosseous vascular access device is being developed as a means for infusing fluids, medications and other substances directly into the bone marrow cavity and from there into the central venous circulation. The intraosseous route provides a means for infusing fluids, medications and other substances directly into the bone marrow cavity which communicates with the central venous circulation via nutrient and emissary veins. This route is well established, having been used for decades in a variety of settings including trauma, especially military trauma, and pediatric emergencies. It has been shown to be bioequivalent to the intravenous route. Complication rates are low and there are few contraindications. Currently available intraosseous devices pass through the skin into the bone and are therefore limited to short term use. PortIO is a novel, implantable intraosseous vascular access device which does not require accessing the central venous system and does not have an indwelling intravascular component. It is designed to be highly resistant to occlusion and, we believe, may not require regular flushing. It features simplified, near-percutaneous insertion and removal, without the need for surgical dissection or radiographic confirmation.

Status of Lucid Clinical Trials
 
Lucid is currently seeking to accelerate our collection of clinical utility data through a range of trials that can be efficiently executed. These efforts include a planned investigator-initiated, retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data on the approximately 400 San Antonio fire fighters who underwent testing as part of a community-sponsored cancer awareness event (in respect of which we expect to publish results in the first half of 2023); an ongoing investigator-initiated, retrospective, single-center, study with 500 patients (in respect of which we expect to publish results mid-2023), a virtual-patient randomized controlled trial with intended recruitment of 100-200 physician participants (in respect of which we expect to publish results this year); a Lucid-sponsored multi-center, prospective, observational study with 500 patients; and a Lucid-sponsored registry at existing Lucid Test Centers, whereby all patients undergoing EsoCheck testing will be given the opportunity to provide informed consent and contribute data about their risk factors, EsoGuard results, and subsequent diagnostic and/or therapeutic journey. Both Lucid-sponsored observational/registry studies expect to have preliminary results and/or interim analysis before the end of 2023.
 
As previously disclosed, consequently, Lucid has decided to delay for the time being the two previously commenced clinical trials, the “EsoGuard screening study” (“BE-1”) and the “EsoGuard case-control study” (“BE-2”), as Lucid is devoting our clinical resources to the studies cited above, which we expect will more efficiently generate the clinical data Lucid is currently prioritizing to drive EsoGuard commercialization.


LucidDx Labs Laboratory Operations Update
 
On February 14, 2023, Lucid Diagnostics and LucidDx Labs Inc. entered into an agreement (the “MSA Termination Agreement”) with RDx, pursuant to which the parties mutually agreed to terminate the MSA-RDx without cause. The termination was effective as February 10, 2023. Until the termination of the MSA-RDx, RDx had continued to provide certain testing and related services for the Laboratory in accordance with the terms of the MSA-RDx. Recently, however, Lucid accelerated the development of internal resources necessary to operate the Laboratory entirely on its own. Accordingly, the Company believes that termination of the MSA-RDx will improve the efficiency of the performance of the EsoGuard assay.
 
Among other things, the MSA Termination Agreement reduces the remaining amounts of the earnout payments and management fees due under the APA-RDx and the MSA-RDx to $725,000 (from the $3,450,000 that would otherwise have been payable under the APA and MSA if the MSA had remained in effect through the balance of its stated term), resulting in a net savings to Lucid Diagnostics of $2,725,000. The payment was satisfied through the issuance of 553,436 shares of Lucid Diagnostics’ common stock on February 25, 2023. Lucid Diagnostics was not required to make any cash payments in connection with the termination.
 
#CheckYourFoodTube Events
 
In January 2023, Lucid successfully completed its first #CheckYourFoodTube Precancer Testing Event, in partnership with Rachelle Hamblin, M.D., M.P.H., and the San Antonio Fire Department (SAFD), to detect esophageal precancer in at-risk members of the department. The SAFD testing event was held over two weekends in January, which has been designated as Firefighter Cancer Awareness Month by the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF). A total of 391 members, nearly one-quarter of the department, who were deemed by Dr. Hamblin to be at-risk for esophageal precancer, underwent a brief, on-site, noninvasive cell collection procedure, performed by Lucid clinical personnel using its EsoCheck® Esophageal Cell Collection Device. Firefighters with suspected esophageal precancer based on a positive EsoGuard result were identified, including some less than forty years of age, and will undergo appropriate monitoring and treatment, as indicated by clinical practice guidelines, to prevent progression to esophageal cancer. These events, which Lucid looks to expand across the country, are an extension of Lucid’s recently introduced and expanding satellite Lucid Test Center (sLTC) program, which brings our precancer testing directly to patients—at their physician’s office and now at large testing day events. Lucid demonstrated that its nurse practitioners can each perform up to fifty EsoCheck procedures in a day, and its laboratory team handled over two hundred incoming samples in a day, while maintaining turnaround times at target. These successes provide an excellent foundation for future testing events as we continue to drive EsoGuard commercialization using all the tools at our disposal.
 
Veris Health Commercialization Update
 
In December 2022, Veris Health signed a license agreement for the Veris CCP software with its first customer, New Jersey Cancer Care. Since, Veris Health onboarded the first cohort of patients of that practice onto the Veris CCP as well, and has signed license agreements with two additional cancer centers. These successes lay the groundwork for Veris Health’s expansion plans with respect to the Veris CCP software as it seeks to onboard cancer centers and patients across the country.
 
NASDAQ Notice
 
On December 29, 2022, the Company received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq stating that, for the prior 30 consecutive business days (through December 28, 2022), the closing bid price of the Company’s common stock had been below the minimum of $1 per share required for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The notification letter stated that the Company would be afforded 180 calendar days (until June 27, 2023) to regain compliance. In order to regain compliance, the closing bid price of the Company’s common stock must be at least $1 for a minimum of ten consecutive business days. In February 2023, the Company distributed a proxy statement for a special meeting of shareholders to be held on March 31, 2023 (the “Special Meeting”), at which the Company will be seeking approval of an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation, to effect, at any time prior to the one-year anniversary date of the Special Meeting, (i) a reverse split of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock at a specific ratio, ranging from 1-for-5 to 1-for-15, to be determined by the board of directors of the Company in its sole discretion, and (ii) an associated reduction in the number of shares of common stock the Company is authorized to issue, from 250,000,000 shares to 50,000,000 shares. If the proposed reverse stock split is approved, the Company anticipates it will regain compliance with the Nasdaq requirements for continued listing.

Payroll and Benefit Expense Reimbursement Agreement
 
On November 30, 2022, PAVmed and Lucid entered into a payroll and benefit expense reimbursement agreement (the “PBERA”). Historically, PAVmed has paid for certain payroll and benefit-related expenses in respect of Lucid’’s personnel on behalf of Lucid, and Lucid has reimbursed PAVmed for the same. Pursuant to the PBERA, PAVmed will continue to pay such expenses, and Lucid will continue to reimburse PAVmed for the same. The PBERA now provides that the expenses will be reimbursed on a quarterly basis or at such other frequency as the parties may determine, in cash or, subject to approval by the board of directors of each of PAVmed and Lucid, in shares of Lucid’s common stock, with such shares valued at the volume weighted average price of such stock during the final ten trading days preceding the later of the two dates on which such stock issuance is approved by the board of directors of each of PAVmed and Lucid (subject to a floor price of $0.40 per share), or in a combination of cash and shares. However, in no event shall Lucid issue any shares of its common stock to PAVmed in satisfaction of all or any portion of the expenses if the issuance of such shares of its common stock would exceed the maximum number of shares of common stock that the Issuer may issue under the rules or regulations of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”), unless Lucid obtains the approval of its stockholders as required by the applicable rules of the Nasdaq for issuances of shares of its common stock in excess of such amount.
Financing
 
Securities Purchase Agreement - March 31, 2022 - Senior Secured Convertible Note - April 4, 2022 and Senior Secured Convertible Note - September 8, 2022
 
Effective as of March 31, 2022, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) with an accredited institutional investor (“Investor”, “Lender”, and /or “Holder”), pursuant to which we agreed to sell, and the Investor agreed to purchase an aggregate of $50.0 million face value principal of Senior Secured Convertible Notes. The SPA provided for the sale to the Investor of an initial Senior Secured Convertible Note with a face value principal of $27.5 million, which closed on April 4, 2022 (the “April 2022 Senior Convertible Note”). The SPA also provided for sales of additional Senior Secured Convertible Notes in one or more additional closings (upon the satisfaction of certain conditions), with an aggregate face value principal of up to an additional $22.5 million. The April 2022 Senior Convertible Note proceeds were $24.4 million after deducting a $2.5 million lender fee and the Company’s offering costs of approximately $0.6 million, inclusive primarily of $0.5 million placement agent fees.
 
On September 8, 2022, we completed an additional closing under the SPA, in which we sold to the Investor an additional Senior Secured Convertible Note with a face value principal of $11.25 million (the “September 2022 Senior Convertible Note”).

Lucid Diagnostics Inc. - Committed Equity Facility and ATM Facility
 
In March 2022, our majority-owned subsidiary, Lucid Diagnostics, entered into a committed equity facility with an affiliate of Cantor Fitzgerald (“Cantor”). Under the terms of the facility, Cantor committed to purchase up to $50 million of Lucid Diagnostics common stock from time to time upon the request of Lucid Diagnostics. While there are distinct differences, the facility is structured similarly to a traditional at-the-market equity facility, insofar as it allows Lucid Diagnostics to raise primary capital on a periodic basis at prices based on the existing market price. Through December 31, 2022, 680,263 shares of common stock of Lucid Diagnostics were issued under this facility for total proceeds of approximately $1.8 million.
 
In November 2022, Lucid Diagnostics also entered into an “at-the-market offering” for up to $6.5 million of its common stock that may be offered and sold under a Controlled Equity Offering Agreement between Lucid Diagnostics and Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. In the year ended December 31, 2022, there were no Lucid Diagnostics shares sold through their at-the-market equity facility. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, through March 9, 2023, Lucid Diagnostics sold 230,068 shares through its at-the-market equity facility for approximately $0.3 million.
 
Lucid Diagnostics - Series A Preferred Stock Offering
 
On March 7, 2023, Lucid entered into subscription agreements for the sale of 13,625 shares (the “Lucid Series A Preferred Stock”). Each share of the Lucid Series A Preferred Stock has a stated value of $1,000 and a conversion price of $1.394. The terms of the Lucid Series A Preferred Stock also include a one times preference on liquidation and a right to receive dividends equal to 20% of the number of shares of Lucid common stock into which such Lucid Series A Preferred Stock is convertible, payable on the one-year and two-year anniversary of the issuance date. The Lucid Series A Preferred Stock is a non-voting security, other than with respect to limited matters related to changes in terms of the Lucid Series A Preferred Stock. The aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of shares in such offering were $13.625 million.

Intellectual Property
 
Our business depends on our ability to create or acquire proprietary medical device and diagnostics technologies to commercialize. We own or have the right to use intellectual property rights, such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how, pertaining to our EsoCheck and EsoGuard technology, our Veris technology and our EsoCure, CarpX and PortIO products, among other technologies and products.
 
We intend to vigorously protect our proprietary technologies’ intellectual property rights in patents, trademarks and copyrights, as available through registration in the United States and internationally. We currently have applied for, license or own 55 domestic and foreign patents across 11 families of products, including patents protecting our EsoCheck, EsoGuard and Veris technology. The date the patents protecting certain of our owned and licensed technology will first begin to expire is as set forth in the table below (although currently pending patent applications, both foreign and domestic, are positioned to provide protection beyond such date in each instance).
 

Technology | Year 
-----------------+------------------
EsoCheck | May 2034 
EsoGuard | August 2024 
Veris Health | November 2038 
EsoCure | March 2036 
CarpX | November 2037 
PortIO | November 2035 

 
Patent protection and other proprietary rights are thus essential to our business. Our policy is to aggressively file patent applications to protect our proprietary technologies including inventions and improvements to inventions. We seek patent protection, as appropriate, on:
 

● | the product itself including all embodiments with future commercial potential; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the methods of using the product; and 
● | the methods of manufacturing the product. 

 
In addition to filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States, we intend to file counterpart patent applications in other countries worldwide where there is a value in doing so. Foreign filings can be cumbersome and expensive, and we will pursue such filings when we believe they are warranted as we try to balance our international commercialization plans with our desire to protect the global value of the technology.
 
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent or as a result of delays in patent prosecution by the patentee, and a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment (PTA), which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent, or patent term extension, which restores time lost due to regulatory delays.
 
We intend to continuously reassess and fine-tune our intellectual property strategy in order to fortify our position in the United States and internationally. Prior to acquiring or licensing a technology from a third party, we will evaluate the existing proprietary rights, our ability to adequately obtain and protect these rights and the likelihood or possibility of infringement upon competing rights of others.
 
We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and upon licensing opportunities, to develop and maintain our competitive position. We intend to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and/or proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants, independent contractors and other entities who may have access to proprietary information. We will generally require employees to assign patents and other intellectual property to us as a condition of employment with us. All of our consulting agreements will pre-emptively assign to us all new and improved intellectual property that arise during the term of the agreement.
 
PAVmed also has (directly or through its subsidiaries) proprietary rights to a range of trademarks, including, among others, PAVmed™, Lucid Diagnostics™, LUCID™, VERIS™, Oncodisc™, CarpX®, EsoCheck®, EsoGuard®, EsoCheck Cell Collection Device®, Collect + Protect®, EsoCure Esophageal Ablation Device™, NextFlo™, and PortIO™. (Solely as a matter of convenience, trademarks and trade names referred to herein may or may not be accompanied with the requisite marks of “™” or “®”. However, the absence of such marks is not intended to indicate, in any way, PAVmed Inc. or its subsidiaries will not assert, to the fullest extent possible under applicable law, their respective rights to such trademarks and trade names.)

Health Insurance Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Our ability to successfully commercialize our products will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for the procedures during which our products are used.
 
In the United States, third-party payors continue to implement initiatives that restrict the use of certain technologies to those that meet certain clinical evidentiary requirements. In addition to uncertainties surrounding coverage policies, there are periodic changes to reimbursement. Third-party payors regularly update reimbursement amounts and also from time to time revise the methodologies used to determine reimbursement amounts. This includes annual updates to payments to physicians, hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers for procedures during which our products are used. An example of payment updates is the Medicare program’s updates to hospital and physician payments, which are done on an annual basis using a prescribed statutory formula. In the past, when the application of the formula resulted in lower payment, Congress has passed interim legislation to prevent the reductions.
 
A product’s reimbursement profile, both in the U.S. and internationally, is an important component of the product’s commercial opportunity. We prefer projects with existing reimbursement codes, the opportunity to seek reimbursement under higher-value surgical procedure codes or the potential to seek reimbursement under narrow, product-specific codes as opposed to bundled procedure codes. For those products that have high strategic value, but with less defined reimbursement, we have engaged reimbursement experts and support from industry associations to accelerate the acquisition of satisfactory reimbursement levels.
 
See “EsoGuard and EsoCheck—Reimbursement and Market Access” above for a fuller discussion of the reimbursement status for EsoCheck and EsoGuard.
 
Competition for New Medical Device Innovation
 
Developing and commercializing new products is highly competitive. The market is characterized by extensive research and clinical efforts and rapid technological change. We face intense competition worldwide from medical device, biomedical technology and medical products and combination products companies, including major medical products companies. We may be unable to respond to technological advances through the development and introduction of new products. Most of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, sales, distribution, manufacturing and technological resources. These competitors may also be in the process of seeking FDA or other regulatory approvals, or patent protection, for new products. Our competitors may commercialize new products in advance of our products. Our products also face competition from numerous existing products and procedures, some of which currently are considered part of the standard of care. We believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are:

● | the quality of outcomes for medical conditions; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | acceptance by surgeons and the medical device market generally; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ease of use and reliability; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | technical leadership and superiority; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | effective marketing and distribution; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | speed to market; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | product price and qualification for coverage and reimbursement. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We will also compete in the marketplace to recruit and retain qualified scientific, management and sales personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies and licenses complementary to our products or advantageous to our business. We are aware of several companies that compete or are developing technologies in our current and future products areas. In order to compete effectively, our products will have to achieve market acceptance, receive adequate insurance coverage and reimbursement, be cost effective and be simultaneously safe and effective.
 
See “EsoGuard and EsoCheck—Competition” and “Veris Cancer Care Platform—Competition” above for a fuller discussion of the competitive environment for our key products, EsoCheck, EsoGuard and the Veris Cancer Care Platform.

Government Regulation
 
Key U.S. Regulation
 
FDA Regulation
 
Generally, products we develop must be cleared by the FDA before they are marketed in the United States. Before and after approval or clearance in the United States, our products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the FDCA and/or the Public Health Service Act, as well as by other regulatory bodies. FDA regulations govern, among other things, the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, safety, storage, recordkeeping, market clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, import and export, marketing and sales, and distribution of medical devices and products.
 
In the United States, medical devices are subject to varying degrees of regulatory control and are classified in one of three classes depending on the extent of controls the FDA determines are necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and efficacy:
 

● | Class I: general controls, such as labeling and adherence to quality system regulations; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Class II: special controls, pre-market notification (often referred to as a 510(k) application), specific controls such as performance standards, patient registries, post-market surveillance, additional controls such as labeling and adherence to quality system regulations; and 
● | Class III: special controls and approval of a PMA application. 

 
In general, the higher the classification, the greater the time and cost to obtain approval to market. There are no “standardized” requirements for approval, even within each class. For example, the FDA could grant 510(k) status, but require a human clinical trial, a typical requirement of a PMA. They could also initially assign a device Class III status but end up approving a device as a 510(k) device if certain requirements are met. The range of the number and expense of the various requirements is significant. The quickest and least expensive pathway would be 510(k) approval with just a review of existing data. The longest and most expensive path would be a PMA with extensive randomized human clinical trials. We cannot predict how the FDA will classify our products, nor predict what requirements will be placed upon us to obtain market approval, or even if they will approve our products at all.
 
To request marketing authorization by means of a 510(k) clearance, we must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating the proposed device is substantially equivalent to another currently legally marketed medical device, has the same intended use, and is as safe and effective as a currently legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than does a currently legally marketed device. 510(k) submissions generally include, among other things, a description of the device and its manufacturing, device labeling, medical devices to which the device is substantially equivalent, safety and biocompatibility information, and the results of performance testing. In some cases, a 510(k) submission must include data from human clinical studies. Marketing may commence only when the FDA issues a clearance letter finding substantial equivalence. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any product modification that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the product, or would constitute a significant change in intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, if the device would no longer be substantially equivalent, would require PMA, or possibly, a de novo pathway under section 513(f)2 of the FDCA. In addition, any additional claims the Company wished to make at a later date may require a PMA. If the FDA determines the product does not qualify for 510(k) clearance, they will issue a Not Substantially Equivalent letter, at which point the Company must submit and the FDA must approve a PMA or issue premarket clearance using the de novo before marketing can begin.
 
In 1997, the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA) added the de novo classification pathway under section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act, establishing an alternate pathway to classify new devices into Class I or II that had automatically been placed in Class III after receiving a Not Substantially Equivalent (NSE) determination in response to a 510(k) submission. In this process, a sponsor who receives an NSE determination may, within 30 days of receiving notice of the NSE determination, request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act.
 
In 2012, section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act was amended by section 607 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA), to provide a second option for de novo classification. In this second pathway, a sponsor who determines there is no legally marketed device upon which to base a determination of substantial equivalence may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act without first submitting a 510(k).
 
During the review of a 510(k) submission, the FDA may request more information or additional studies and may decide the indications for which we seek approval or clearance should be limited. In addition, laws and regulations and the interpretation of those laws and regulations by the FDA may change in the future. We cannot foresee what effect, if any, such changes may have on us.
 
FDA Regulations will continue to change and evolve including the 2016-21st Century Cures Act which mandated the creation and revision of policies and processes intended to speed patient access to new medical devices and codifying into law the FDA’s expedited review program for breakthrough devices for which EsoGuard was so designated. In 2017, the Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act (FDARA) which included improvements to premarket review times and investments in strategic initiatives like the National Evaluation System for health Technology (NEST) and patient input and decoupling accessory classification from classification of the parent device. We must continue to be aware of these changes that possibly impact our development and commercialization work. The Company has a network of professionals with extensive experience in these matters that advise us on both the pre-approval/clearance requirements as well as the post market surveillance compliance obligations.

--

Clinical Trials of Medical Technology
 
One or more clinical trials may be necessary to support an FDA submission. Clinical studies of unapproved or uncleared medical devices or devices being studied for uses for which they are not approved or cleared (investigational devices) must be conducted in compliance with FDA requirements. If an investigational device could pose a significant risk to patients, the sponsor company must submit an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE application to the FDA prior to initiation of the clinical study. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing it is safe to test the device on humans and the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company the investigation may not begin. Clinical studies of investigational devices may not begin until an institutional review board (“IRB”) has approved the study.
 
During any study, the sponsor must comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements. These requirements include investigator selection, trial monitoring, adverse event reporting, and record keeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices, and comply with reporting and record keeping requirements. We, the FDA, or the IRB at each institution at which a clinical trial is being conducted may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable risk. During the approval or clearance process, the FDA typically inspects the records relating to the conduct of one or more investigational sites participating in the study supporting the application.
 
Post-Approval Regulation of Medical Devices
 
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
 

● | the FDA Quality Systems Regulation (QSR), which governs, among other things, how manufacturers design, test manufacture, exercise quality control over, and document manufacturing of their products; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | labeling and claims regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; and, 
● | the Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires reporting to the FDA of certain adverse experience associated with use of the product. 

 
We will continue to be subject to inspection by the FDA to determine our compliance with regulatory requirements.
 
Manufacturing cGMP Requirements
 
Manufacturers of medical devices are required to comply with FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) set forth in the quality system regulations promulgated under section 520 of the FDCA. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, and civil and criminal penalties. Adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA and could result in the imposition of marketing restrictions through labeling changes or in product withdrawal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following the approval. We expect to use contract manufacturers to manufacture our products for the foreseeable future we will therefore be dependent on their compliance with these requirements to market our products. We work closely with our contract manufacturers to assure our products are in strict compliance with these regulations.
Laboratory Certification, Accreditation and Licensing
 
Lucid’s CLIA-certified laboratory is subject to U.S. and state laws and regulations regarding the operation of clinical laboratories. CLIA requirements and laws of certain states, including those of California, New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Florida, impose certification requirements for clinical laboratories, and establish standards for quality assurance and quality control, among other things. CLIA provides that a state may adopt different or more stringent regulations than federal law and permits states to apply for exemption from CLIA if the state’s laboratory laws are equivalent to, or more stringent than, CLIA. For example, the State of New York’s clinical laboratory regulations, which have received an exemption from CLIA, contain provisions that are in certain respects more stringent than federal law. Therefore, as long as New York maintains a licensure program that is CLIA-exempt, Lucid will need to comply with New York’s clinical laboratory regulations in order to offer Lucid clinical laboratory products and services in New York.
 
Lucid has current certificates to perform clinical laboratory testing. Clinical laboratories are subject to inspection by regulators and to sanctions for failing to comply with applicable requirements. Sanctions available under CLIA and certain state laws include prohibiting a laboratory from running tests, requiring a laboratory to implement a corrective plan, and imposing civil monetary penalties. If Lucid’s CLIA-certified laboratory fails to meet any applicable requirements of CLIA or state law, that failure could adversely affect any future CMS consideration of its technologies, prevent their approval entirely, and/or interrupt the commercial sale of any products and services and otherwise cause Lucid to incur significant expense.

Other U.S. Regulation
 
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing and promotion of drugs and devices, other federal and state laws restrict our business practices. These laws include, without limitation, anti-kickback and false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.
 
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities, including certain sales and marketing practices and the provision of certain items and services to our customers, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal and civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
 
Physician Payment Sunshine Act
 
There has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities. On February 8, 2013, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, released its final rule implementing section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act known as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act that imposes new annual reporting requirements on device manufacturers for payments and other transfers of value provided by them, directly or indirectly, to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their family members. A manufacturer’s failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year, and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures.” Manufacturers that produces at least one product reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid, or Children’s Health Insurance Program and (i) if the product is a drug or biological, and it requires a prescription (or physician’s authorization) to administer; or (ii) if the product is a device or medical supply, and it requires premarket approval or premarket notification by the FDA are required to comply with the Open Payments (commonly referred to as the Sunshine Act) filing requirements under CMS. We currently do not have any products covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or Children’s Health Insurance Program as none of our products have premarket approval or clearance notification. We expect once our products receive regulatory clearance, we will be required to comply with the Sunshine Act provisions.
 
Certain states, such as California and Connecticut, also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, and other states, such as Massachusetts and Vermont, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements.
 
Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
 
The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated.
 
Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.

Federal False Claims Act
 
The False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The False Claims Act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled, such as a rebate. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the False Claims Act. Several pharmaceutical, device and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-covered uses.
 
The government may further prosecute, as a crime, conduct constituting a false claim under the False Claims Act. The False Claims Act prohibits the making or presenting of a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent and, unlike civil claims under the False Claims Act, requires proof of intent to submit a false claim.
 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts.
Healthcare Reform
 
Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may result in lower reimbursement for our products, or for the procedures associated with the use of our products, or limit coverage of our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of our products. Alternatively, the shift away from fee-for-service agreements to capitated payment models may support the value of our products which can be shown to decrease resource utilization and lead to cost saving-for both payors and providers.
 
HIPAA and Other Privacy Laws
 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HIPAA”) established comprehensive protection for the privacy and security of health information. The HIPAA standards apply to three types of organizations, or “Covered Entities”: health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and healthcare providers that conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically. Covered Entities and their business associates must have in place administrative, physical, and technical standards to guard against the misuse of individually identifiable health information. Some of our activities, including at our Lucid Test Centers and within our clinical trials, involve interactions with patients and their health information which implicate HIPAA. Our activities also involve us entering into specific kinds of relationships with Covered Entities and business associates of Covered Entities, which also implicate HIPAA. Penalties for violations of HIPAA include civil money and criminal penalties.
 
Our activities must also comply with other applicable privacy laws, which impose restrictions on the access, use and disclosure of personal information. More state and international privacy laws are being adopted. Many state laws are not preempted by HIPAA because they are more stringent or are broader in scope than HIPAA. Since 2020 we have also had to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which protects personal information other than health information covered by HIPAA. In the E.U., the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) took effect in May 2018 and imposes increasingly stringent data protection and privacy rules. All of these laws may impact our business and may change periodically, which could have an effect on our business operations if compliance becomes substantially costlier than under current requirements. Our failure to comply with these privacy laws or significant changes in the laws restricting our ability to obtain stool, blood and other patient samples and associated patient information could significantly impact our business and our future business plans.
 
Self-Referral Law
 
The federal “self-referral” law, commonly referred to as the “Stark” law, provides that physicians who, personally or through a family member, have ownership interests in or compensation arrangements with a laboratory are prohibited from making a referral to that laboratory for laboratory tests reimbursable by Medicare, and also prohibits laboratories from submitting a claim for Medicare payments for laboratory tests referred by physicians who, personally or through a family member, have ownership interests in or compensation arrangements with the testing laboratory. The Stark law contains a number of specific exceptions which, if met, permit physicians who have ownership or compensation arrangements with a testing laboratory to make referrals to that laboratory and permit the laboratory to submit claims for Medicare payments for laboratory tests performed pursuant to such referrals. We are subject to comparable state laws, some of which apply to all payors regardless of source of payment, and do not contain identical exceptions to the Stark law.

International Regulation
 
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. We may be subject to regulations and product registration requirements in the areas of product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import and export restrictions and tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. The time required to obtain clearance required by foreign countries may be longer or shorter than required for FDA clearance, and requirements for licensing a product in a foreign country may differ significantly from FDA requirements.
European Union
 
The European Union or EU will require a CE mark certification or approval in order to market our products in the various countries of the European Union or other countries outside the United States. To obtain CE mark certification of our products, we will be required to work with an accredited European notified body organization to determine the appropriate documents required to support certification in accordance with existing medical device directive. The predictability of the length of time and cost associated with such a CE mark may vary or may include lengthy clinical trials to support such a marking. Once the CE mark is obtained, we may market our product in the countries of the EU. The new European Medical Device Regulation (EU MDR 2017/745) which was scheduled to go into effect on May 26, 2020 has been extended by one year to May 26, 2021. The EU MDR imposes strict new requirements on medical device companies marketing their products in Europe. As such, many device companies have been scrambling to renew existing CE certificates granted under the Medical Devices Directive (MDD 93/42/EEC). Notified Bodies are now focused on their current customers and those customers’ current devices making it virtually impossible to submit a new MDD application before May 2020.
European Good Manufacturing Practices
 
In the European Union, the manufacture of medical devices is subject to good manufacturing practice (GMP), as set forth in the relevant laws and guidelines of the European Union and its member states. Compliance with GMP is generally assessed by the competent regulatory authorities. Typically, quality system evaluation is performed by a Notified Body, which also recommends to the relevant competent authority for the European Community CE Marking of a device. The Competent Authority may conduct inspections of relevant facilities, and review manufacturing procedures, operating systems and personnel qualifications. In addition to obtaining approval for each product, in many cases each device manufacturing facility must be audited on a periodic basis by the Notified Body. Further inspections may occur over the life of the product.
Other Laws
 
Occupational Safety and Health
 
In addition to its comprehensive regulation of health and safety in the workplace in general, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements aimed specifically at laboratories and other healthcare-related facilities. In addition, because Lucid’s operations may require employees to use certain hazardous chemicals, Lucid also must comply with regulations on hazard communication and hazardous chemicals in laboratories. These regulations require Lucid, among other things, to develop written programs and plans, which must address methods for preventing and mitigating employee exposure, the use of personal protective equipment, and training.
Specimen Transportation
 
Our commercialization activities for EsoGuard subject Lucid to regulations of the Department of Transportation, the United States Postal Service, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that apply to the surface and air transportation of clinical laboratory specimens.
Environmental
 
The cost of compliance with federal, state and local provisions related to the protection of the environment has had no material effect on our business. There were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.
Employees 
 
Currently, as of March 9, 2023 we had 124 employees (all of whom were full-time employees), inclusive of our executive officers — our Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), our President and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), our Chief Operating Officer (“COO”), our Chief Medical Officer (“CMO”) and our General Counsel and Secretary (“General Counsel”). No employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
