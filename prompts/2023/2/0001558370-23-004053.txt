Item 1. Business
​
General
​
The Company is a value added information technology (“IT”) distribution and solutions company. The Company primarily operates through its “Distribution” segment, which distributes emerging technologies to corporate resellers, value added resellers (VARs), consultants and systems integrators worldwide under the name “Climb Channel Solutions”. The Company also operates a smaller segment called “Solutions”, which is a cloud solutions provider and value-added reseller of software, hardware and services for customers worldwide under the name “GreyMatter”. Across both segments, we offer an extensive line of products from leading software vendors and tools for virtualization/cloud computing, security, networking, storage and infrastructure management, application lifecycle management and other technically sophisticated domains as well as computer hardware.
​
The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1982. On October 31, 2022, the Company adopted its current name, Climb Global Solutions, Inc. Our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Common Stock”) is listed on The NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “CLMB”.
​
Distribution Segment 
​
In our Distribution segment, which accounted for approximately 93% of our consolidated net sales and 83% of our consolidated gross profit during the year ended December 31, 2022, we distribute technology products from software developers, software vendors or original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to resellers, and system integrators worldwide. We purchase software, maintenance/service agreements, networking/storage/security equipment and complementary products from our vendors and sell them to our reseller customers. The large majority of products we sell are “drop shipped” directly to the customers, which reduces physical handling by the Company and required investment in inventory. Generally, a vendor authorizes a limited number of companies to act as distributors of their product and sell to resellers of their product. Our reseller customers include value-added resellers, or VARs, corporate resellers, government resellers, system integrators, direct marketers, and national IT superstores. We combine our core strengths in customer service, marketing, distribution, credit and billing to allow our customers to achieve greater efficiencies in time to market in the IT channel in a cost-effective manner. 
​
While our Distribution business is characterized by low gross profit as a percentage of adjusted gross billings, or gross margin, and price competition, we have been able to operate profitably by leveraging an efficient and scalable business model with low capital investment requirements. The large majority of the products we sell are either digital products such as license authorizations, third party maintenance contracts, or hardware that is dropped shipped to the end customer directly by the vendor. We utilize electronic digital interchange (“EDI”) and other automation to fulfill these orders on a cost-efficient basis. We also maintain relatively low inventory balances relative to our gross billings and enjoy what we believe is favorable credit from our vendor partners, allowing us to deploy a capital efficient model as reflected by our return on equity and pre-tax income as a percentage of gross profit generated.
​
In our Distribution segment, we are highly dependent on the end-market demand for the products we sell, and on our partners’ strategic initiatives and business models. This end-market demand is influenced by many factors including the introduction of new products, replacement and renewal cycles for existing products, competitive products, overall economic growth and general business activity. A difficult and challenging economic environment may also lead to consolidation or decline in the industry and increased price-based competition. We continually review the marketplace to identify new and emerging vendors and products to potentially add to our vendor partners. 
​
Solution Segment 
​
We also provide comprehensive IT solutions directly to end users through our Solutions segment, which accounted for approximately 7% of our consolidated net sales and 17% of our consolidated gross profit during the year ended December 31, 2022. Products in this segment are acquired directly from OEMS, software developers or distributors

and sold to end users. We provide customer service, billing, sales and marketing support in this segment and provide extended payment terms to facilitate sales.
​
The Company operates a distribution facility in Eatontown, New Jersey. 
​
Acquisitions
​
We view acquisitions as an important part of our strategic growth plan. In 2020, we completed two acquisitions to add scale, broaden our geographic footprint, expand partner relationships and add cloud support capabilities.
​
In 2022, we completed the acquisition of Spinnakar Limited (“Spinnakar”), which expanded our sales presence in the United Kingdom distribution operations and brought key vendor partner relationships to our portfolio. 
​
We plan to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities as part of our strategic growth plan going forward.
​
Products
​
An essential part of our ongoing operations and strategic growth plan in our Distribution segment is the continued recruitment of software vendors for which we become authorized distributors of their products. Through our Distribution segment, we sell a wide variety of technology products from a broad range of software vendors and manufacturers, such as Bluebeam Software, Flexera Software, Intel Software, Microsoft, Micro Focus, Mindjet, SmartBear Software, SolarWinds, Sophos, StorageCraft Technology, TechSmith, Trend Micro, Unitrends, Tintri and Extrahop. On a continuous basis, we screen new vendors and products for inclusion in our line card based on their features, quality, price, profit margins and current market trends. Developing a diverse vendor base is a key element of our business strategy. We focus on establishing deep relationships with our vendor and reseller partners by providing specialized product training to our sales force and the use of dedicated sales teams. We have also established an efficient ordering process with our key partners through the implementation of electronic ordering and other processes adapted to their requirements. As a result, our relationships with our key vendor partners tend to be long-term in nature despite the absence of long-term contracts, with a significant portion of sales derived from annually recurring renewals of software maintenance and subscription agreements related to our partners embedded base of customers utilizing their software products. Additionally, a key part of our strategic growth plan is to provide a high level of support to select emerging technology vendors through our Climb Elevate program to develop future relationships throughout the growth cycle of a vendor partner.
​
In our Solutions business, an essential part of our strategic growth plan is to pursue opportunities with higher growth prospects and gross margin characteristics through the sale of specialty products, services and cloud offerings. Through acquisitions in the prior years, we added certain technical and administrative support capabilities to enable us to resell cloud and software as a service products (“SaaS”) including Microsoft products in the United Kingdom. Our strategic growth plan is to expand our cloud offerings by leveraging these support services to other markets and products.
​
For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had two vendors that accounted for 17% and 9%, respectively, of our consolidated purchases. For the year ended December 31, 2021, these same two vendors accounted for 20% and 10%, respectively, of our consolidated purchases. The loss of a key vendor or group of vendors could disrupt our product availability and otherwise have an adverse effect on the Company.
​
The Company predominantly sells third party software, software subscriptions, and maintenance. Sales of hardware and peripherals represented 6% and 5% of our adjusted gross billings in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
​
Cloud
​
Our vendor and reseller partners are increasingly incorporating cloud and hybrid cloud products into their portfolios. An essential part of our strategic growth plan is to provide value added services to our vendor partners and customers to enhance their ability to market these products. This includes maintaining infrastructure to facilitate licensing of cloud and SaaS products, providing technical support for cloud products, and providing integration and enablement

services. We currently have the ability to provide support for these cloud services in the United Kingdom and Europe, and plan to continue to leverage these capabilities to provide cloud support services throughout our worldwide operations.
​
Marketing and Distribution
​
We market products through creative marketing communications, including our web sites, local and on-line seminars, events, webinars, and social media. We also use direct e-mail and printed material to introduce new products and upgrades, to cross-sell products to current customers, and to educate and inform existing and potential customers. We believe that our blend of electronic and traditional marketing and selling programs are important marketing vehicles for software vendors and manufacturers. These programs provide a cost-effective and service-oriented means to market and sell and fulfill software products and meet the needs of users.
​
We sell products to large, multi-national broad line resellers, sometimes referred to as direct market resellers (DMRs), as well as thousands of VARs, which tend to be smaller and focus on value added services to their customers. As part of our strategic growth plan, we expect to continue diversifying our customer base by offering compelling products to the VAR community as we develop our vendor partner lineup. As a result, an increasing proportion of our sales in 2022 were from VARs, driven by a continued focus on increasing sales to larger VARs with more than $1 million in annual sales. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had two customers, both of whom are considered DMRs, that accounted for 21%, and 16%, respectively, of consolidated net sales and as of December 31, 2022, 16% and 18%, respectively, of total net accounts receivable. For the year ended December 31, 2021, these same two customers accounted for 18%, and 17%, respectively, of consolidated net sales and as of December 31, 2021, 18% and 22%, respectively, of total net accounts receivable. Our top five customers accounted for 52% and 51% of consolidated net sales in 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
​
Net sales to customers in Canada represented 8% and 9% of our consolidated net sales in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net sales in Europe and the rest of the world represented 14% and 13% of our consolidated net sales in 2022 and 2021, respectively. For geographic financial information, please refer to Note 13 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
​
Customer Support
​
We believe that providing a high level of customer service is necessary to compete effectively and is essential to continued sales and revenue growth. Our account representatives assist our customers with all aspects of purchasing decisions, order processing, returns processing, and inquiries on order status, product pricing and availability. The account representatives are trained to answer all basic questions about the features and functionality of products. 
​
Purchasing and Fulfillment
​
The Company’s success is dependent, in part, upon the ability of its vendor partners to develop and market products that meet the changing requirements of the marketplace. The Company believes it maintains good relationships with its vendors. The Company and its principal vendors have cooperated frequently in product introductions and in other marketing programs. As is customary in the industry, the Company has no long-term supply contracts with any of its vendor partners, and substantially all the Company’s contracts with its vendors are terminable upon 30 days’ notice or less, however, it is notable that the tenure of our relationships with vendor partners tends to extend over a longer term. We attribute this to the deep relationships we establish with our partners involving sales support, product and customer knowledge, and tailored infrastructure to facilitate efficient order processing. 
​
Most vendor partners or distributors will “drop ship” products directly to the customers, which reduces physical handling by the Company. Inventory management techniques, such as “drop shipping” allow the Company to offer a greater range of products without increased inventory requirements or cost of carrying inventory.
​
Inventory levels may vary from period to period, due in part to increases or decreases in sales levels, the Company’s practice of making advance purchases when it deems the terms of such purchases to be attractive, and the addition of new vendor partners and products. From time to time, we may make advance payments to vendors to apply

against future purchases from the vendor. Moreover, the Company’s order fulfillment and inventory control systems allow the Company to order certain products in time for next day shipping. The Company promotes the use of EDI with its vendor partners and customers, which helps reduce overhead and the use of paper in the ordering process. 
​
Competition
​
The Company operates in a highly competitive environment, both in the United States and internationally. There is significant competition within each market segment and geography served that creates pricing pressure and the need to continually improve services. The market for the technology products we sell is characterized by rapid changes in technology, user requirements, and competitive pricing. The way software products are distributed and sold is constantly changing, and new methods of distribution and sale may emerge or expand, including direct sales by technology providers to end users, and the introduction of cloud versions of their products. As an IT channel solutions provider, a critical element of our strategic growth plan is to maintain our ability to offer an efficient route to market for emerging technology vendors. Additionally, a key element of our strategic growth plan is to capitalize on market changes by implementing new value added services such as cloud support and integration offerings.
​
In our Distribution segment, we compete with other distributors to become an authorized distributor of products from software developers and vendors. The Company competes to gain distribution rights for new products primarily based on its reputation for successfully bringing new products to market and the strength of and quality of its relationships with software vendors and the reseller community. We also compete against other distributors to gain market share among authorized resellers for products we are authorized to distribute based on price, and level of service. We compete against much larger broad-line distributors with more resources than we have, including Arrow Electronics Inc. (NYSE: ARW), TD Synnex Corporation (NYSE: SNX) and Ingram Micro, as well as specialty distributors. We believe we offer a compelling solution for emerging technology vendors seeking to establish the IT channel as a route to market, by offering broad distribution capabilities with more flexibility than some of our larger competitors. 
​
In our Solutions segment, we compete against a large variety of IT solutions providers including e- commerce sites, service organizations, value added resellers, cloud solution providers and technology providers offering direct solutions. We believe that our ability to offer software developers and IT professionals easy access to a wide selection of desired IT products at reasonable prices with prompt delivery and high customer service levels, along with our good relationships with vendor partners, allows us to compete effectively.
​
Information Technology
​
The Company operates IT systems on several platforms including Windows and cloud-based platforms that control the full order processing cycle. These IT systems allow for centralized management of key functions, including inventory, accounts receivable, purchasing, sales and distribution and payment processing. We are dependent on the accuracy and proper utilization of our technology systems, telephone systems, websites, e-mail and EDI systems.
​
Our IT systems allow us to monitor sales trends, real-time product availability, order status throughout the full order cycle, and automates order transactions and invoicing transactions for our customers and vendors. The main focus of our IT systems is to allow us to transact and communicate with our customers and vendors in the most efficient manner possible. We provide various options to transact electronically with our customers and vendors through EDI, XML and other electronic methods.
​
The Company recognizes the need to continually upgrade its IT systems to effectively manage and secure its infrastructure and customer data and to provide continued scalability and flexibility. In that regard, the Company anticipates that it will, from time to time, require software and hardware upgrades for its present IT systems.
​
