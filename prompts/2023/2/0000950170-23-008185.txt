 AwareID
 AwareID is our new Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS) offering that is used for Aware’s adaptive authentication platform of cloud-based biometric application programming interfaces (“APIs”) and turnkey services. AwareID provides biometric face and voice analysis for liveness-verification, and document validation. The platform uses proprietary Adaptive Authentication technology in cloud-based bundles which can be pre-configured and configured by the

customer to provide comprehensive authentication functionality with situational awareness for onboarding, access control/management, and authentication of transactions. These services can be used discretely to enhance investments already in place or combined to provide higher functionality. The AwareID platform is built on open architecture and interfaces to maximize interoperability and connection to other biometric and/or digital identity applications and platforms. AwareID is provided as a SaaS offering with usage-based pricing. This wider SaaS offering includes the solutions formerly referred to as Indigo and FortressID.
Software products
 We sell a broad range of software components, or “building blocks”, such as SDKs, APIs, and applications that customers use to streamline or develop their systems into more effective solutions. These building blocks enable important functions including:
 1.Matching of biometric samples against biometric databases.
 2.Enrollment, analysis, and processing of biometric images and identity data on workstations.
 3.Image compression
 BioComponents bundles our offerings as applications with a user interface. We also license our software unbundled as building blocks and have primarily sold these offerings as a perpetual license.
 Historically, we sold our software products under perpetual or fixed-term licenses. With the introduction of AwareID, we have incorporated SaaS offerings into our product line-up. While we did not recognize material revenues from our SaaS offerings during 2022, we expect SaaS to become a significant product offering moving forward.
  Building Blocks: SDKs, APIs, Applications, and Subsystems
 Biometric Search & Matching SDKs
 Our SDKs consist of: i) multiple software libraries; ii) sample applications that show customers how to use the libraries; and iii) documentation. Customers use our SDKs to design and develop biometrics applications. Nexa is our line of biometric search and match SDKs, including Nexa|Fingerprint, Nexa|Face, Nexa|Iris and Nexa|Voice. These products provide high-performance biometric algorithms for fingerprint, facial, iris and voice identification or authentication. The algorithms in these products convert images into biometric templates, which can then be compared to templates stored in databases to find matches.
In addition to the Nexa line, we also offer AwareXM, an interoperable fingerprint matching SDK that provides MINEX-certified, INCITS 378-compliant fingerprint minutiae extraction, template generation, and fingerprint authentication.
 Biometric Enrollment SDKs and APIs
 Our suite of enrollment SDKs and APIs performs functions that are critical to biometric enrollment, including (i) image capture and hardware abstraction, (ii) image quality assurance, (iii) image compression, (iv) mobile enrollment, matching and liveness verification, and (v) fingerprint card processing.
 Imaging products
 In addition to our biometrics software products, we also sell products used in applications involving medical and advanced imaging. Our principal imaging product is Aware JPEG 2000, which is based on the JPEG2000 standard. The JPEG2000 standard is an image compression standard and coding system that was created by the Joint Photographic Experts Group committee in 2000. Our JPEG2000 product is used to compress, store, and display images. Those images are typically medical images.
 Software maintenance
We also provide and sell software maintenance to many of our customers who purchase our software products and solutions. Software maintenance has historically been made available by contracts that typically have a one-year term during which customers have the right to receive technical support and software updates for a fixed fee, if and when

they become available. Software maintenance is also available as part of a subscription-based solution offering under which customers receive standard software maintenance plus access to upgrades and product enhancements.
Services
 We provide a variety of program management and software engineering services, including: i) project planning and management; ii) system and architecture design; iii) software design, development, customization, configuration, and testing; and iv) software integration and installation. Services are sold in conjunction with our products and solutions and are provided for a fixed fee.
Service engagement deliverables may include: i) complete customer software solutions; ii) one or more subsystems comprised of software products that are integrated within a larger system; iii) custom-configured versions of existing software products; or iv) custom-designed software products. In some cases, the software resulting from service engagements may form the basis for new or improved Aware software solutions and/or products.
Our customers for services include: i) government agencies; ii) large multinational systems integrators; iii) smaller systems integrators with a particular market, technology or geographic focus; and iv) commercial partners or providers of products, solutions, and services for themselves or to their end customers. We provide services directly to end-users or indirectly to end-users through systems integrators or commercial entities or partners. When we provide services to systems integrators, they are often engaged with the end-user as a prime contractor and are responsible for delivery of a complete solution, in which case we typically serve as a subcontractor assigned a subset of the total scope of work.
 The scope of our services projects varies. A small project might involve configuration and testing of a single software product, taking a small team one month or less. A large project might involve delivery of a more complex solution comprised of multiple products and subsystems, requiring a larger team to conduct program and project management, system design, software customization and integration, and taking up to one year or more. Some projects are followed by subsequent follow-on projects that serve to change or extend the features and functionality of the initial system.
Distribution Methods
 We sell our products, solutions and services through three principal channels of distribution:
 i)Systems integrator channel – we sell to systems integrators that incorporate our software products and solutions into biometric systems that are delivered primarily to government end users.
 ii)Direct channel – we sell directly to government and as well as commercial customers.
 iii)OEM and VAR channel – we sell to hardware and software solution providers that incorporate our software products into their products for resale or use in their solution offerings or integrated software products. 
 Major Customers
 All of our revenue in 2022 and 2021 was derived from unaffiliated customers. No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue in either 2022 or 2021. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, two customers combined for 37% and 32%, respectively, of our net accounts receivable and unbilled receivables.
Competitive Business Conditions
 A significant number of established companies have developed or are developing and marketing software and hardware for biometrics products and applications that currently compete with or will compete directly with our offerings. We believe that additional competitors will enter the biometrics market and become significant long-term competitors, and that, as a result, competition will increase. Companies competing with us may introduce solutions that are competitively priced, have increased performance or functionality or incorporate technological advances we have not yet developed or implemented. Our current principal competitors include:
•Diversified technology providers that offer integrated biometrics solutions to governments, law enforcement agencies and other organizations. This group of competitors includes companies such as Idemia, Thales, and NEC.


•Component providers that offer biometrics software and hardware components for fingerprint, facial, iris and voice biometric identification. This group of competitors includes companies such as FaceTec, iProov, and Innovatrics.
 We expect competition to intensify in the near term in the biometrics market. Many current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, and research resources than we have. Moreover, low-cost foreign competitors have demonstrated a willingness to sell their products at significantly reduced prices. To compete effectively in this environment, we must continually develop and market new and enhanced solutions and technologies at competitive prices and must have the resources available to invest in significant research and development activities. Our failure to compete successfully could cause our revenues and market share to decline.
Intellectual Property
 We rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions, as well as patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law to protect our proprietary rights. We have an active program to protect our proprietary technology through the filing of patents. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 79 U.S. and foreign patents and approximately 8 pending patent applications. Our patents and patent applications pertain primarily to biometrics and imaging compression. We have let certain patents expire that are not aligned with our business and are not relevant to our current or future activities.
Although we have patented certain aspects of our technology, we rely primarily on trade secrets to protect our intellectual property. We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants, and through security measures. Each of our employees is required to sign a non-disclosure agreement. Although we intend to protect our rights vigorously, we cannot guarantee that these measures will be successful. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries.
Third parties may assert exclusive patent, copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us. We may receive claims from third parties suggesting that we may be obligated to license such intellectual property rights. If we were found to have infringed any third party’s patents, we could be subject to substantial damages or an injunction preventing us from conducting our business.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2022, we employed 82 people, all based in the U.S, including 46 in engineering and research, 24 in sales and marketing, and 12 in finance and administration. Of these employees, 64 were based in Massachusetts and 18 were based outside of Massachusetts. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our employee relations to be good.
We believe that our future success will depend in large part on the service of our technical, sales, marketing and senior management personnel and upon our ability to retain highly qualified technical, sales and marketing and managerial personnel. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to retain our key managers and employees or that we will be able to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel in the future.
