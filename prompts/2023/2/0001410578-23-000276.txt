​
Overview
We believe that the future of audio technology is in wireless devices and that WiSA is well positioned to deliver best-in-class immersive wireless sound technology for intelligent devices and next generation home entertainment systems. We currently sell modules which wirelessly transmit and receive audio directly to speakers. Additionally, we plan to license our proprietary software technology, currently embedded in our wireless modules, to other companies who can then embed our technology into other Wi-Fi enabled smart devices. The segment of the wireless audio market that WiSA focuses on is comprised of scalable multichannel solutions with levels of latency that are low enough to synchronize with video. The term multichannel refers to the use of multiple audio tracks to reconstruct a sound field using multiple speakers.
As part of the effort to grow the wireless multichannel home audio segment, WiSA Technologies, Inc (f/k/a Summit Wireless) was a founding member of the WiSA Association, an association dedicated to providing industry leadership and consumer choice through interoperability testing between brands. Products certified and marked with a WiSA Association logo have been tested to interoperate. This preserves consumer choice by enabling consumers to choose different wireless transmitting products across different brands where audio is decoded with speakers that have the WiSA Association logo displayed. Our marketing strategy focuses on, what we believe, are two emerging wireless audio market needs: immersive, multi-channel audio and lower signal latency. WiSA currently sells custom semiconductor chips and wireless modules to a growing list of consumer electronics customers, including major brands in the consumer electronics industry. We believe that a growing adoption of our technology by leaders in this industry will revolutionize the way people experience media content through their mobile devices, televisions (“TVs”), game consoles and personal computers (“PCs”).
Our Business Focus
Our primary business focus is to enable mainstream consumers and audio enthusiasts to experience high quality wireless immersive audio. We intend to continue selling our proprietary wireless modules to consumer electronics companies while also expanding our focus to implement a lower-cost solution by porting our software onto commercially available internet of things (“IoT”) modules with integrated Wi-Fi technology.
Industry Background
The primary growth segments for in-home entertainment have been “Bluetooth” stereo accessories which include single speakers, headsets, and more recently, “multi-room” stereo speakers that use your home’s Wi-Fi network to stream audio throughout house. Another market that continues to grow is the sound bar market. Sound bars are typically sold with wireless subwoofers and may also be sold with wireless rear speakers.
Our Technology
Our fundamental technology addresses some of the main issues that we perceive hinder the growth of immersive audio in the home: complexity of installation and setup, cost, interoperability between smart devices and the speakers or soundbars. We believe that consumers want to experience theater-quality immersive sound from the comfort of their homes. However, traditional immersive audio systems, commonly referred to as home theater surround sound systems, are wired and often require expensive audio-visual (“AV”) receivers to decode the audio stream, leaving the consumer with the burden of concealing the wires. Hiring a professional to hide the wires into the walls or floor is invasive, complicated, costly, and time consuming. Further, people who rent as opposed to own their home, may not be able to install these systems as the installation construction needed may not be permitted under a lease agreement. Our first-generation wireless technology addresses these problems by transmitting wireless audio to each speaker at Blu-ray quality (uncompressed 24 bit audio up to 96 kHz sample rates) and emphasizing ease of setup. To our knowledge, WiSA’s custom chips and modules technology is one of the only technologies available today that can stream up to eight (8) separate wireless audio channels with low latency, removing lip-sync issues between the audio and video sources. In addition, every speaker within a system that utilizes our technology can be synchronized to less than one microsecond, thus eliminating phase distortion between speakers. WiSA’s first-generation technology shows that wireless immersive audio systems are viable home audio solutions for the average consumer and audio enthusiast alike.

Having successfully developed wireless audio solutions for the high-end of the immersive audio market, WiSA is continuing its development of proprietary software targeted at bringing its best-of-class immersive audio technology to entry/mid-level audio systems. Noting the growth of the sound bar market, WiSA plans a low-cost, entry-level wireless audio solution designed to meet the needs of the consumer looking for a sound bar-based, value-driven immersive audio system. To address this market segment, WiSA is currently developing certain proprietary software for which patent applications have been submitted that will enable sound bars as well as smart devices that have Wi-Fi and video media to deliver immersive audio. A prototype version of our software technology has been demonstrated to select customers (pursuant to confidentiality agreements). Our goal is to commercialize a software based-solution, which other brands can integrate into their devices, that will (i) reduce integration costs for mass market use, (ii) utilize Wi-Fi for wireless connectivity, making it easy to integrate into today’s high volume, low cost systems on a chip (“SOC”) and modules, (iii) provide a low power consumption option to allow for use in battery-powered devices, and (iv) provide compatibility with popular consumer electronic operating systems.
WiSA Association
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, WiSA, LLC, operates the WiSA Association, which is an association of brands, manufacturers, and influencers within the consumer electronics industry, with the purpose of promoting a standardized method of interoperability between wireless audio components using WiSA’s technology. The WiSA Association creates, maintains and manages specifications for wireless interoperability that are available to all WiSA Association members. For products with a WiSA Association certification, the WiSA Association also creates, maintains, and manages testing criteria and specifications for all products to be listed, marketed and sold. WiSA-certification is an industry-wide “stamp of approval” certifying that a product is interoperable with other products in the WiSA ecosystem and has passed several high-performance tests ensuring interoperability and wireless performance standards are met. As the sole owner of WiSA, LLC, we certify all WiSA Association products.
In 2018, we introduced the WiSA Ready™ certification. The WiSA Ready™ certification identifies entertainment sources – such as TVs, gaming systems or computers – that are equipped to deliver up to eight (8) channels of HD audio to WiSA-certified speakers when connected with a WiSA Universal Serial Bus (“USB”) transmitter. This program simplifies consumer setup and reduces costs by replacing AV receivers or wireless hubs with a low-cost USB accessory. We believe that using WiSA Ready™ products allows consumers to more simply and conveniently enjoy wireless multi-channel sound, eliminating the clutter, wires, and complicated installs generally required to create immersive audio experiences. LG Electronics and Hisense have introduced TV and projector product lines that have been certified WiSA Ready™. Additionally, TCL, Skyworth, and Bang & Olufsen have built WiSA’s modules into some of their TVs.
Currently, WiSA-certified products are required to use WiSA modules in order to meet the standards set by the WiSA Association. As a result, WiSA Association members purchase modules from us in order to build their products to meet such standards.
Among WiSA-certified products, consumers will be able to outfit their home entertainment system with WiSA-certified speakers and components from any participating vendor with the assurance that the devices will interoperate and provide high quality wireless HD surround sound.
The WiSA Association manages logo usage and trademark guidelines, investigates alternative markets, connects brands to manufacturing resources, and, we believe, provides industry leadership in solving the challenges facing the home theater and commercial markets in the integration of wireless audio technology.
As part of building the category of immersive audio and driving consumer awareness, WiSA has created the WiSA Wave, which includes a number of online direct-to-consumer marketing programs. WiSA Association has dramatically increased consumer awareness, as measured by web traffic through WiSA’s websites. There were approximately 1.4 million web visitors in 2022. WiSA utilizes Google analytics to identify and measure unique user web traffic. WiSA Wave activities have expanded to include joint marketing WiSA products with retailers, the creation of WiSA storefronts on retailer websites, retailer co-op ads, and multibrand ads supporting WiSA members. Additionally, WiSA uses the WiSA Wave to drive the promotion and sale of the Platin Audio line of immersive audio speaker systems, a brand of speakers designed to promote WiSA Certified functionality at new price points and product performance levels.

Modules
WiSA has designed wireless modules that provide high performance wireless audio for our customers to integrate into their products, such as a speaker, TV, media hubs and USB or HDMI dongles. These modules include our custom semiconductors with our intellectual property (“IP”) built in as well as a Wi-Fi radio for communications. By designing and selling these modules, we believe that we can reduce our customers’ design expense, accelerate their time-to-market cycle, and reduce the cost of each module. WiSA offers both a “TX” module to transmit the audio from a host device like a media hub, TV or dongle to WiSA-enabled speakers and an “RX” model for speakers that receive the wireless audio signal and processes it for audio play out.
Modules for Consumer Products
WiSA’s TX modules are targeted for integration into TVs, AV receivers, media hubs and USB or HDMI dongles. WiSA’s transmitter, with its integrated antenna, is designed to support rooms as large as 10 meters by 10 meters with uncompressed, 24 bit audio up to 96 kHz sample rate. The module supports a simple interface, with Inter-IC Sound (“I2S”) or USB audio and control. In addition, WiSA’s technology has been approved by Digital Content Protection, LLC, the licensing agency for High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection, as an audio-only output technology for retransmission of audio content.
WiSA’s receiver interfaces to a digital amplifier and is designed to be integrated directly into a home theater speaker. The four (4) printed circuit board (PCB) antennas simplify system integration while providing robust reception of 24 bit audio up to 96 kHz sample rates virtually anywhere within a 10 meter by 10 meter space. It supports one or two separate audio outputs via I2S. An optional interface on the receiver module can be enabled to configure the speaker type and provide volume/mute control at the speaker. Alternatively, the speaker type can be assigned at the factory for preconfigured Home Theater in a Box applications.
The WiSA Opportunity
We believe that the following attributes: cost, mobility, video support, ease of installation and quality create a market opportunity for WiSA’s technologies to be adopted by the consumer electronics industry as described further below.
Cost
We believe that the simplicity and cost structure of our current WiSA SoundSend transmitter and upcoming embedded software solution will make our prices competitive for a wider range of applications, allowing consumer electronics companies to integrate our technology, while also delivering high quality audio.
Video Support
Wireless audio capable of supporting video has become a priority for consumers across a variety of high-volume multimedia platforms, including TV’s, smartphones, game consoles and set-top boxes. Video applications require audio and video to be perfectly synchronized in order to avoid lip-sync and speaker audio phase distortion issues. WiSA's technology prioritizes low latency and synchronization to less than one microsecond, thus practically eliminating phase distortion between speakers.
Ease of Installation
We believe that the home entertainment market has moved toward simplicity in recent years. The costly and inconvenient home theaters of the past have left consumers with a desire for audio systems that provide a simplified installation process. We believe that new audio systems, including the predominant sound bar system, are unable to provide high levels of performance, especially in the surround-sound market. WiSA’s technology greatly simplifies the installation process of true surround-sound systems. This allows consumers to install a home theater system with the same amount of effort as a sound bar, but enjoy a far superior experience. We believe that an overwhelming majority of the content entering consumers’ homes through digital TV and streaming services is provided in a multi-channel format, which is why WiSA’s goal is to facilitate enjoyment of true surround sound for both the everyday consumer and audio enthusiast.

In addition to easy installation, WiSA modules provide consumers with a multitude of options, allowing customization of a home theater specific to each consumer, without being forced to stick with one brand of speaker. For example, our hope is that a consumer might start with a WiSA enabled sound bar for their TV and then add a WiSA enabled subwoofer. That same system can be easily upgraded to a variety of surround sound systems by simply adding more speakers. Our technology will allow consumers to upgrade an audio system or just one component of the system without the need to replace the entire system. Consumers can keep the original transmitter, sound bar, and subwoofer and integrate them seamlessly into a new system. Being able to outfit a home entertainment system with WiSA-enabled speakers and components gives consumers the ability to express their individual preference and needs and provides the assurance that the devices will interoperate, delivering what we believe is the highest standard in HD wireless surround sound.
Dissatisfaction with Bluetooth Performance and Quality
We believe that consumers want better performance and quality from their Bluetooth audio devices. For example, they may want headsets that stay connected over longer distances or products that offer better audio fidelity. By offering a solution that addresses these needs at a comparable price point to Bluetooth, we believe that we can build consumer demand for our technology.
Profitability of Audio Component Accessories
High-definition televisions (“HDTVs”) are getting thinner and it is becoming increasingly difficult to incorporate the latest electronic advances into such thin displays. Over two hundred million smart TVs are currently sold annually. We expect that eventually most of the electronics will be external to the display. We believe that the first physical feature to be removed from HDTVs will be the audio component, since there is very little room for quality speakers in today’s thin displays. We believe that HDTV manufacturers know that they need to provide an audio alternative. Additionally, since cost is a significant consideration, we believe that some manufacturers may offer external sound bars which will satisfy some consumers, but perhaps not the consumers who desire a high-quality audio alternative. We believe that these developments are creating an inflection point in the market, and manufacturers are looking to WiSA’s technology to create a standard for wireless audio interoperability that will support a long-term product strategy for the successful development of high quality, wireless audio products. By designing speaker systems that incorporate WiSA’s technology, consumer electronics companies will be able to sell easy-to-install surround sound audio solutions alongside TVs.
Enjoyment of improved audio on existing content
We believe that the growth in the number of video devices streaming multi-channel audio content, coupled with new 3D immersive sound experiences from Dolby’s Atmos and DTS’ DTS:X formats, will help propel the demand for wireless speakers well into the future.
Enjoyment of wireless audio without interference from other wireless signals
Having other devices nearby that also use the 5 GHz band should not affect the performance of a WiSA-enabled audio system, as WiSA’s technology can seamlessly switch to another frequency within the 5 GHz band. The 5 GHz U-NII spectrum utilized by WiSA technology has up to 24 channels available that are constantly monitored for interference using the Dynamic Frequency Selection sub-band between 5.2 and 5.8 GHz. When interference is detected, the next channel, having been monitored for over one minute and confirmed for accessibility, is ready to be accessed and WiSA-enabled devices switch seamlessly to that channel, without the user ever noticing or the audio experience being affected.
What Distinguishes WiSA from its Competitors
Both the proprietary technology and the adoption of the technology by leaders in consumer electronics are differentiating factors for WiSA. Our management believes that WiSA is one of the only companies with the technical capabilities of transmitting high resolution, low latency, and speaker synchronization of wireless audio capable of supporting up to eight channels. Premium consumer brands, like Bang & Olufsen, Harman International, a division of Samsung, and LG Electronics have begun to adopt our technology as a valued feature in performance products.

Category Defining Wireless Audio
Our first generation wireless audio technology delivers industry leading eight channels of uncompressed audio directly to the speakers in 24 bit and up to 96 kHz sample rates. This means that a consumer can experience audio exactly as it was mastered in the studio. WiSA's technology supports surround sound systems up to 7.1 or 5.1.2 for Dolby Atmos® configurations.
Alternative technologies such as, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi standards were not designed to transmit fixed low latency audio that is synchronized to video. However, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi standards can work well for audio-only wireless transmission, when video is not a part of the listening experience. In audio-only applications, latency is less critical and audio data can be buffered in memory to ensure proper speaker synchronization even when data retransmissions are needed in today’s congested wireless environments. In video applications, retransmissions add to latency. Standard Bluetooth and Wi-Fi standards have long variable latency that can exceed acceptable audio to video synchronization and make quality multichannel audio experience unachievable. A few custom silicon-based solutions exist today that improve on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi standards based performance, but compared to WiSA, such products have longer latencies, lower performing speaker synchronization, and are limited to 2-4 audio channels and often only support 16 bit CD quality audio.
WiSA’s technology roadmap includes proprietary software that will enable standard Wi-Fi protocol to support multi-channel audio for video applications, while permitting WiSA to leverage Wi-Fi’s lower chip and module cost structure. WiSA’s first generation technology was designed for the mid to high end home theater market and offers a unique feature set that is expected to be included in new product designs for years. WiSA’s new Wi-Fi strategy enables the Company to compete in the entry-level home theater market at Bluetooth price points, while delivering superior multi-channel performance for higher volume applications. The Company’s recently announced Discovery module is the first product that integrates WiSA’s new software which enables a transceiver module to keep up to four independent wireless audio channels synchronized in a room size up to 10 meters square. The Discovery modules is ideally suited for entry level home entertainment systems, including sound bars, TVs, subwoofers and Dolby Atmos® applications.
WiSA Customers
WiSA currently sells wireless modules containing custom semiconductor chips to a growing list of consumer electronics customers, including major brands such as Bang & Olufsen, KEF, LG, Harman International, a division of Samsung, Savant, Skyworth and System Audio. We believe that the use of our products by well-known consumer electronics brands will provide an opportunity to create wireless audio products that are simple to install and perform at high levels. Brands such as Bang & Olufsen and Harman have chosen WiSA technology to drive their wireless home audio/theater product assortments. We believe that their leadership has brought credibility to the technology and paved the way at retail for other brands to follow.

We currently sell our modules in relatively small quantities. As new customers introduce WiSA-enabled products and current customers introduce second and third-generation WiSA-enabled products, we expect that orders for our modules will increase proportionally. With larger orders, we believe that we can take advantage of economies of scale and improve gross margins on our modules.
Interoperability
Interoperability is a key aspect of wireless technology. We believe that this is especially true with audio technology, where unique designs, price points, audio quality and capabilities as well as consumer brand loyalties are significant factors for the end consumer. Creating home theater and audio components that all work with an interoperable standard creates a high level of confidence in retailers and consumers in the functionality of the entire entertainment system. Interoperability also increases the opportunity for specialized brands to create new and innovative products knowing they can focus on their specific part of the market and rely on others to create the necessary cohort components. 
Proprietary Software
A significant amount of our time and resources are being allocated towards launching a software licensing part of our business. Customers will receive a license for our TX software, so that any of their devices with a suitable Wi-Fi radio can transmit audio compliant with our standard without having to purchase and integrate our TX module. We believe that this software will be well positioned for use by major consumer electronics companies in many devices including TVs, handsets, gaming consoles, and computers. Patent applications have been submitted for key technology innovations in this software.
Research and Development
As of March 14, 2023, our research and development department consisted of 29 dedicated employees. WiSA’s engineering team has a wide range of expertise, capable of developing all levels of product design, from Application Specific Integrated Circuits (“ASIC”) to modules to finished products. WiSA research and development has and will continue developing trade secrets for Digital Signal Processing (“DSP”), RF design and testing of WiSA technologies.
WiSA has developed multiple ASICs and certified modules for integration into multiple wireless audio designs by ODMs which are currently shipping to consumers. The ASIC hardware solution uses a high-performance proprietary network protocol for transmission of multi-channel audio.
WiSA is also currently shipping and developing modules that are Wi-Fi compatible. The Software (“SW”) solution enables multi-channel audio capabilities on off the shelf IoT modules running RTOS and future Linux/Android based multimedia systems. The software solution uses a Wi-Fi network for transmission of multi-channel audio. WiSA released to production a low cost 2.4GHz IoT module supporting (5) audio channels and in the process of porting our software to a 5GHz IoT module in 2023. We have engaged an Indian design center to focus on Android integration of the core SW for embedded TV applications.
Manufacturing, Logistics and Fulfillment
Our modules are designed and developed in Oregon, and our manufacturing is outsourced to contract manufacturers located in China. Our manufacturing facilities have been ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certified. We purchase components and fabricated parts from multiple suppliers; however, we rely on sole source suppliers for certain components used to manufacture our modules. Several key strategic parts are purchased from suppliers by us and then consigned to our manufacturers, while the vast majority of parts are procured directly by our contract manufacturers. Our operations team manages the pricing and supply of the key components of our modules and seeks to achieve competitive pricing on the largest value-add components, while leveraging our contract manufacturers’ volume purchases for best pricing on common parts. We have strong relationships with our manufacturers, helping us meet our supply and support requirements. Our manufacturing partners procure components and assemble our devices in accordance with our purchase orders. Demand forecasts and manufacturing purchase orders are based upon customer orders, historical trends, and analysis from our sales and product management functions. We believe that our manufacturing capabilities are essential to maintaining and improving product quality and performance, and that using outsourced manufacturing enables greater scale and flexibility than establishing our own manufacturing facilities.
While some modules are delivered from our production facility in Oregon, we have a third-party warehouse and fulfillment center in Hong Kong that delivers the majority our modules.

Sales Channels and Customers
WiSA sells modules and integrated circuits (“ICs”) directly to OEM brands worldwide which in turn, sell their system level products to end customers through a vast channel of retailers and dealer networks. Internationally known brands such as Bang & Olufsen, Harman International, a division of Samsung, LG, System Audio, KEF, and many others are among our current customers, with products aimed at the wireless home theater market. Most of these brands sell through retailers store fronts and online e-tail.
Marketing and Advertising
Effective and consistent marketing and advertising is critical as we grow our wireless audio solutions. We have worked with multiple PR agencies on establishing effective messaging to face all segments within our category including press, brands, reviewers, retailers and consumers. Our focuses are ease of set-up, high quality performance, expandability and the benefits of a true multi-channel surround sound audio solutions.
Competition
The semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change. We compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies, many of which have greater market recognition and greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution and other resources than we have with which to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products. Competitive products include products that: (a) are resistant to interference, low latency, long-range, and able to stream uncompressed audio; (b) target applications in the PC accessory audio, iPod accessory audio, home theater, and consumer & enterprise voice markets; (c) enable smart TVs, computers and mobile devices to connect to their multiple peripherals wirelessly, and simultaneously from a single host, with the ability to mix-and-match peripherals; and (d) utilize Bluetooth technology as a means of transmission. 
We believe that our technology competes favorably with our competitors for a variety of reasons, including, among others:

● | Our technology transmits audio packets with fixed latency in a manner well-suited for multi-channel audio networks and video applications.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our technology contains WiFi compatible software which provides the following future key benefits:
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | WiFi is not inherently proficient for transporting low latency audio. WiSA has spent the last 5 years developing a protocol that can leverage off the shelf high volume low cost 2.4GHz and 5GHz IoT chips and modules and scale to higher audio channel counts. As chip technology performance improves so will our performance.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | WiFi compatibility allows us to operate more efficiently in congested environments while delivering the performance the market demands.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | A software solution will allow WiSA Technologies to pivot into new markets quicker than those making custom proprietary chip solutions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are many other factors that impact our ability to be competitive and may impact our success against both larger and emerging competitors.
Intellectual Property
We have key IP assets, including patents and trade secrets developed based on our technical expertise. As of March 14, 2023, we had 13 issued and 10 pending U.S. patents covering our technology. Our currently issued patents expire at various times from September 25, 2027 through March 1, 2040.
IP is an important aspect of our business, and our practice is to seek protection for our IP as appropriate. A multi-channel audio for surround sound system has technical requirements not required by simple stereo only systems. Multi-channel systems require each audio channel to be precisely played in time to create a sound field that correlates to video being viewed by a consumer. WiSA has developed hardware and software core technologies that manage system network latency and speaker phase. WiSA’s patents are based on protecting our low latency network algorithms and multi receiver synchronization.

We pursue a general practice of filing patent applications for our technologies in the U.S. and occasionally in foreign countries where our customers manufacture, distribute, or sell licensed products. We actively pursue new applications to expand our patent portfolio to address new technological innovations. We have multiple patents covering aspects and improvements for many of our technologies.
Our trademarks cover our various products, technologies, improvements, and features, as well as the services that we provide. These trademarks are an integral part of our technology licensing program, and licensees typically elect to place our trademarks on their products to inform consumers that their products incorporate our technology and meet our quality specifications.
We protect our IP rights both domestically and internationally. From time to time, we may experience problems with OEMs of consumer entertainment products in emerging economies. In the event it becomes necessary, we will take all necessary steps to enforce our IP rights.
Moreover, we have relatively no issued patents outside the U.S. Growing our licensing revenue in developing countries may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent rights in these countries, which is uncertain. Further, because of the limitations of the legal systems in many countries, the effectiveness of patents obtained or that may in the future be obtained, if any, is uncertain.
Employees
As of March 14, 2023, we had a total 49 employees working in the United States and internationally. In the United States, we had 46 employees, including 29 employees that work in our research and development department, 11 employees in our sales and marketing department, 1 employee that works in our manufacturing/logistics/fulfillment department and 5 employees that work in our general and administrative department. Additionally, we have one logistics employee and one sales employee in Taiwan. None of our employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have experienced no work stoppages. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
