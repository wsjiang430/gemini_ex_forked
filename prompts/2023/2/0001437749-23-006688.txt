Item 1.  Business
Overview
 
Vaxart Biosciences, Inc. was originally incorporated in California under the name West Coast Biologicals, Inc. in March 2004 and changed its name to Vaxart, Inc. (“Private Vaxart”) in July 2007, when it reincorporated in the state of Delaware.
 
On February 13, 2018, Private Vaxart completed a reverse merger (the “Merger”) with Aviragen Therapeutics, Inc. (“Aviragen”), pursuant to which Private Vaxart survived as a wholly owned subsidiary of Aviragen. Under the terms of the Merger, Aviragen changed its name to Vaxart, Inc. and Private Vaxart changed its name to Vaxart Biosciences, Inc. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to “Vaxart,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” in this Annual Report mean Vaxart, Inc., the combined company.
 
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company primarily focused on the development of oral recombinant vaccines based on our Vector-Adjuvant-Antigen Standardized Technology (“VAAST”) proprietary oral vaccine platform. Our oral vaccines are designed to generate broad and durable immune responses that may protect against a wide range of infectious diseases and may be useful for the treatment of chronic viral infections and cancer. Our investigational vaccines are administered using a room temperature-stable tablet, rather than by injection.
 
We are developing prophylactic vaccine candidates that target a range of infectious diseases, including norovirus (a widespread cause of acute gastro-intestinal enteritis), SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”)), and seasonal influenza. Several Phase 1 human studies with our norovirus vaccine candidates have been successfully completed. A Phase 2 challenge study evaluating safety and clinical efficacy of our GI.1 norovirus vaccine candidate is currently ongoing. A Phase 2 dose-ranging study evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of our bivalent GI.1 and GII.4 norovirus vaccine candidate is currently ongoing. We have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial for our first COVID-19 vaccine candidate and reported that the study met its primary and secondary endpoints. The first part of a Phase 2 study with our second COVID-19 vaccine candidate that commenced in late 2021 has been completed. We have also initiated preclinical work on novel COVID-19 vaccine constructs that seek to create a potent pan-betacoronavirus vaccine candidate that would respond to SARS-CoV-2 and also other betacoronaviruses (such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV). Data indicating that our monovalent H1 influenza vaccine candidate protected participants against H1 influenza infection as well as a leading marketed injectable vaccine in a Phase 2 challenge study was published in 2020 (Lancet ID). In addition, we have generated preclinical data for a prophylactic vaccine candidate targeting respiratory syncytial virus (“RSV”) (a common cause of respiratory tract infection) and of our first therapeutic vaccine candidate targeting cervical cancer and dysplasia caused by human papillomavirus (“HPV”).
 
We believe our oral tablet vaccine candidates offer several important advantages:
 
First, they are designed to generate broad and durable immune responses, including systemic, mucosal and T cell responses, which may enhance protection against certain infectious diseases, such as norovirus, COVID-19, influenza, and RSV, and may have potential clinical benefit for certain cancers and chronic viral infections, such as those caused by HPV.
 
Second, our tablet vaccine candidates are designed to provide a more efficient and convenient method of administration, enhance patient acceptance and reduce distribution bottlenecks, which we believe will improve the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns. For example, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the “CDC”), in the 2021/2022 seasonal influenza season, only approximately 51% of the U.S. population was vaccinated against influenza, with particularly low vaccination rates among adults between ages 18 and 49.

Figure 1.  The following table outlines the status of our oral vaccine development programs:
 


We are developing the following tablet vaccine candidates, which are all based on our proprietary platform:
 

● | Norovirus Vaccine. Norovirus is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis symptoms, such as vomiting and diarrhea, among people of all ages in the United States. Each year, on average, norovirus causes 19 to 21 million cases of acute gastroenteritis and contributes to 109,000 hospitalizations and 900 deaths, mostly among young children and older adults. Typical symptoms include dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea with abdominal cramps, and nausea. In a study by the CDC and Johns Hopkins University, published in 2016, the global annual economic impact of norovirus disease was estimated at $60 billion, $34 billion of which occurred in high income regions including the United States. An update by the lead authors estimated the burden in the U.S. alone to be $10.5 billion annually in 2018. Virtually all norovirus disease is caused by norovirus GI and GII genotypes, and we are developing a bivalent vaccine candidate designed to protect against both. Because norovirus is an enteric pathogen that infects epithelial cells of the small intestine, we believe that a vaccine that produces antibodies against norovirus in the intestine, such as our tablet vaccine candidate which is delivered directly to the gut, may provide optimal protection. We anticipate that, if approved, the vaccine will be an annual, one-time administration ahead of the winter season when norovirus incidence is at its peak, similar to the influenza season.

In 2019, we completed the active phase of a Phase 1b clinical trial with our oral tablet vaccine candidates for the GI.1 and GII.4 norovirus strains. Both the oral norovirus GI.1 and GII.4 vaccine candidates were well tolerated with no serious adverse events reported. Most solicited and unsolicited adverse events were mild in severity, and there were no significant differences observed between the vaccine candidate and placebo treatment groups. 
 
Our bivalent vaccine candidate (GI.1 and GII.4 co-administered) demonstrated robust immunogenicity, with an IgA ASC response rate of 78% for the GI.1 strain and 93% for the GII.4 strain for the bivalent cohort of the study, when compared to 86% and 90%, respectively, for the two monovalent cohorts of the study. These results indicate that co-administration of the two vaccine candidates, the intended approach for proceeding into Phase 2 and 3 trials, shows no cross-strain interference, or reduction of the immune response compared with individual (monovalent) vaccine delivery. 
 
In early 2021, we initiated G1.1 dosing in a subset of subjects (second dose after more than one year) in the Phase 1b bivalent study. In results announced in July 2021, we reported that we were able to successfully boost immune responses with the G1.1 norovirus vaccine candidate in prior vaccinated subjects. These boosted responses include IgA antibody secreting cells, as well as IgG and IgA serum antibody responses. In mid-2021, we started a placebo-controlled, dose ranging study in elderly adult subjects aged 55 to 80 to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the G1.1 vaccine candidate in the older population. The top-line results were disclosed in June 2022. The immune response to the vaccine candidate was similar in healthy older individuals (ages 55 to 80) as it was in younger individuals in a previous study as measured by the numbers of antibody secreting cells (IgA ASC) and serum antibodies. Lastly, we conducted an open-label trial to evaluate the optimal timing of boost administration in young adults in which 3 cohorts of subjects received their second dose (boost) at varying timepoints between 1 and 3 months post initial vaccination. The top-line results from this study were disclosed in June 2022. Data indicated that the G1.1 vaccine candidate was able to successfully boost antibody responses, with antibody responses trending better with administration spread out over 3 months versus a shorter interval. 
 
We are currently conducting additional Phase 2 clinical trials with our norovirus vaccine candidates. The first trial, which was initiated in early 2022, is a Phase 2 norovirus challenge study which will evaluate safety, immunogenicity and clinical efficacy of a norovirus GI.1 vaccine candidate compared to a placebo control post norovirus challenge.  In the first quarter of 2023, Vaxart expanded the ongoing Phase 2 GI.1 norovirus challenge study to include additional challenge cohorts. Vaxart believes the increased dataset will improve the likelihood of identifying a correlate of protection between immune responses to the vaccine and a reduction in risk of norovirus infection and/or acute gastroenteritis. Vaxart expects that identifying novel correlate(s) of protection may reduce the size and duration of a Phase 3 trial. Top-line data from this trial is expected in the third quarter of 2023. The second clinical trial, initiated in early 2023, is a Phase 2 multi-center, placebo-controlled dose-ranging trial evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of Vaxart’s bivalent norovirus vaccine candidate in subjects aged 18 years and older. Top-line data from this Phase 2 clinical trial is expected in the middle of 2023, and the study is designed to allow us to select the dose that we intend to use in Phase 3. Upon dose selection, a follow-on Phase 2 study will enroll an estimated 500 subjects which we expect will generate sufficient safety data at the selected dose to enable us to have an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA to gain concurrence on the scope and design of the Phase 3 pivotal efficacy study in adults over 18 years of age.

In the Fall of 2022, we announced a study that would receive significant funding and support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to evaluate whether our bivalent norovirus vaccine candidate induces antibodies in the breast milk of lactating mothers and whether infants up to six months of age can acquire those antibodies by breastfeeding.  Young infants are particularly susceptible to norovirus infection, causing severe dehydration and potentially death, particular in the developing world.  Further, the ability to immunize the youngest of children can be difficult due to the nascent immune system. Passive transfer of antibodies from mother to infant that are induced in milk may protect breastfeeding infants from infectious pathogens. If successful in eliciting antibodies in breast milk, the next step would be to prove that these antibodies can protect young infants and inhibit norovirus transmission among family members.  The study is expected to start in 2023. As a grant recipient from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Vaxart has agreed to a global access commitment for use of its bivalent norovirus vaccine candidate, if proven effective and approved, in breastfeeding mothers from low- and middle-income countries.
 

● | Coronavirus Vaccine. COVID-19, a severe respiratory tract infection caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, is a major cause of hospitalization and death in the U.S. and worldwide. According to the CDC, an outbreak of COVID-19 began in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and rapidly spread worldwide. By January 19, 2023, more than 667 million COVID-19 cases had been identified globally, including in the United States, where the CDC had reported over 101 million infections and one million deaths. While most COVID-19 restrictions, such as stay-at-home orders, have been lifted, COVID-19 continues to spread and remains a public health threat, not least due to the continuing emergence of new variants.

We have spent significant effort developing COVID-19 vaccine candidates over the past few years. We generated multiple vaccine candidates based on the published genome of SARS-CoV-2 and evaluated them in preclinical models for their ability to generate both mucosal and systemic immune responses. Of particular interest were the mucosal immune responses, as coronaviruses primarily infect the respiratory tract. Given the recent emergence of coronavirus strains with mutated S proteins that are considered more contagious than the original strain, serum antibodies from injected vaccines may not adequately protect against these SARS-CoV-2 variants over time, whereas a vaccine that is able to create cross-reactive mucosal antibodies and T cells against conserved epitopes may have significant advantages.
 
On September 14, 2020, we announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) had cleared our Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application to allow initiation of human clinical testing of our first oral COVID-19 (S and N proteins) vaccine candidate VXA-CoV2-1. In February 2021, we announced the preliminary results of the trial. The study achieved both its primary and secondary endpoints of safety and immunogenicity, respectively. Initial results showing cross-reactive mucosal antibody responses were published in Science Translational Medicine. Additional detailed study results and mucosal durability data were reported in medRxiv in July 2022.
 
We announced in February 2021 that we would evaluate additional COVID-19 vaccine candidates that contain just the spike (“S”) protein, and different variant-specific vaccine candidates. After preclinical evaluations (including in non-human primate studies) showed that an improved antibody response could be achieved with a new COVID-19 vaccine candidate (VXA-CoV2-1.1-S) that expressed just the spike protein, we decided to move this candidate forward for clinical evaluation. 
 
An IND for VXA-CoV2-1.1-S was cleared by the FDA in July 2021. We initiated dosing with this candidate in a two-part Phase 2 clinical study in October 2021, with approximately 896 participants planned for enrollment utilizing a two-part study design. The first part of the study (“Part 1”) planned enrollment of 48 participants aged 18 to 55 and 48 participants aged 56 to 75, in order to further evaluate safety and immunogenicity and to assess optimal dosage. Further, half the subjects in the trial would be prior vaccinated (have received two doses of an mRNA vaccine) to test the ability of VXA-CoV2-1.1-S to boost immune responses and enhance variant-specific cross-reactivity, and half the subjects would be naïve to prior vaccinations. The purpose of the study was to evaluate safety and immunogenicity and to assess optimal dosage. Upon dose selection from Part 1, the second part of the study (“Part 2”) planned enrollment of approximately 800 subjects aged 18 to 75. Part 2 was designed to test preliminary vaccine efficacy to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The first part of the study (“Part 1”) has been completed. The actual enrollment of participants for Part 1 was less than planned due to the inability to identify and enroll vaccine-naïve individuals in a timely manner. Top-line data from this portion of the trial was announced in September 2022, indicating that the primary and secondary endpoints were both met. VXA-CoV2-1.1-S was able to boost the serum antibody responses for volunteers that previously received an mRNA vaccine (either Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna). Serum neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan), a recognized correlate of protection, were boosted in this population from a geometric mean of 481 to 778, a fold rise of 1.6. Volunteers that had lower starting titers had larger increases than subjects that had higher titers. There were also substantial increases in the neutralizing antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA4/5 in these volunteers as measured by sVNT assay. Increases in the mucosal IgA antibody responses (antibodies in the nose and mouth) were observed in approximately 50% of subjects.  Subjects that had an increase in the mucosal IgA response to SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan S had an increase in IgA responses to other coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA4/5, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV, demonstrating the cross-reactive nature of these immune readouts. 
 
We have initiated preclinical work on novel vaccine constructs that seek to create a potent pan-betacoronavirus vaccine candidate that would respond to SARS-CoV-2 and also other betacoronaviruses (such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV). As described in the preceding paragraph, Vaxart’s clinical data demonstrated that it is possible to induce cross-reactive antibodies to multiple SARS-CoV-2 strains as well as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV at mucosal surfaces. 
 
In June 2022, we announced a partnership with hVivo Services Limited (“hVIVO”) to test a Vaxart COVID-19 vaccine candidate for efficacy in a SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study. In the first quarter of 2023, we decided to postpone initiating the SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study. As we advance new vaccine candidates, we will determine the best development plan, which may include a human challenge study.

● | Seasonal Influenza Vaccine. Influenza is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. and worldwide and, according to the CDC, only approximately 51% of eligible U.S. citizens were vaccinated in 2021/2022, with particularly low vaccination rates among adults between ages 18 and 49. We believe our oral tablet vaccine candidate has the potential to improve the protective efficacy of currently available influenza vaccines and increase flu vaccination rates.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Influenza is one of the most common global infectious diseases, causing mild to life-threatening illness and even death. Approximately 350 million cases of seasonal influenza occur annually worldwide, of which three to five million cases are considered severe, causing 290,000 to 650,000 deaths per year. Very young children and the elderly are at the greatest risk. In the United States, between 5% and 20% of the population contracts influenza, between 140,000 and 710,000 people are hospitalized with complications of influenza, and between 12,000 and 52,000 people die from influenza and its complications each year, with up to 90% of the influenza-related deaths occurring in adults older than 65. The total economic burden of seasonal influenza has been estimated to be $87.1 billion, including medical costs which average $10.4 billion annually, while lost earnings due to illness and loss of life amount to $16.3 billion annually.
 
We believe our tablet vaccine candidate may potentially address many of the limitations presented by injectable egg-based influenza vaccines for the following reasons: (i) our tablet vaccine candidates are designed to create broad and durable immune responses, which may provide more effective immunity and protect against additional strain variants; (ii) our vaccine candidate is delivered as a room temperature-stable tablet, which we believe would provide a more convenient method of administration, enhancing patient acceptance and simplifying the distribution and administration process; (iii) we believe our tablet vaccine candidate may be manufactured more rapidly than vaccines manufactured using egg-based methods by using recombinant methods; and (iv) using our tablet vaccine candidate in lieu of egg-based vaccines would eliminate the risk of experiencing allergic reactions to egg protein. 
 
In September 2018, we completed a $15.7 million contract with the U.S. Government through the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (“HHS BARDA”) under which a Phase 2 challenge study of our H1N1 flu vaccine candidate was conducted. We announced that, in healthy volunteers immunized and then experimentally infected with H1 influenza, our H1 influenza oral tablet vaccine candidate reduced clinical disease by 39% relative to placebo. Fluzone, the market-leading injectable quadrivalent influenza vaccine, reduced clinical disease by 27%. Our tablet vaccine candidate also showed a favorable safety profile, indistinguishable from placebo. 
 
In October 2018, we presented data from the study demonstrating that our vaccine candidate elicited a significant expansion of mucosal homing receptor plasmablasts to approximately 60% of all activated B cells. We believe these mucosal plasmablasts are a key indicator of a protective mucosal immune response and a unique feature of our vaccine candidates. This data also indicates that our vaccine candidates provide protection by inducing mucosal immunity (the first line of defense against mucosal infections such as flu, norovirus and RSV), marking what could be a key advantage over injectable vaccines.
 
In addition to our conventional seasonal flu vaccine candidate, we entered into a research collaboration agreement with Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. (“Janssen”) in July 2019 to evaluate our proprietary oral vaccine platform for the Janssen universal influenza vaccine program. Under the agreement, we produced a non-GMP oral vaccine candidate containing certain proprietary antigens from Janssen and tested the product in a preclinical challenge model. The preclinical study has been completed and we have submitted a report to Janssen. 
 
Vaxart will work with governments around the world to create pandemic monovalent influenza vaccines for emergency use or stockpiling, if requested.  We are also continuing development of our preclinical seasonal and universal influenza vaccine candidates. 
 

● | RSV Vaccine. RSV is a major respiratory pathogen with a significant burden of disease in the very young and in the elderly.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Based on the positive results of our preclinical cotton rat study, we believe our proprietary oral vaccine platform has the potential to be the optimal vaccine delivery system for RSV, offering significant advantages over injectable vaccines. 
 
The Company remains engaged in discussions with regulatory agencies, governments, non-governmental organizations and other potential strategic parties to determine the best way to progress its RSV program. 
 

● | HPV Therapeutic Vaccine. Our first therapeutic oral vaccine candidate targets HPV 16 and HPV 18, the two strains responsible for 70% of cervical cancers and precancerous cervical dysplasia.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide and in the United States with about 13,000 new cases diagnosed annually in the United States according to the National Cervical Cancer Coalition. 
 
We have tested our HPV 16 vaccine candidate in two different HPV 16 solid tumor models in mice. The HPV 16 vaccine candidate elicited T cell responses and promoted migration of the activated T cells into the tumors, leading to tumor cell killing. Mice that received our HPV 16 vaccine candidate showed a significant reduction in volume of their established tumors. 
 
In October 2018, we filed a pre-IND meeting request with the FDA for our first therapeutic vaccine candidate targeting HPV 16 and HPV 18 and we subsequently submitted our pre-IND briefing package. We received feedback from the FDA in January 2019 to support submission of an IND application to support initiation of clinical testing. 
 
The Company remains engaged in discussions with regulatory agencies, governments, non-governmental organizations and other potential strategic parties to determine the best way to progress its HPV program. 
 
Anti-Virals
 

● | Through the Merger, we acquired two royalty earning products, Relenza and Inavir. We also acquired three Phase 2 clinical stage antiviral compounds, which we have discontinued independent clinical development of. However, for one of these, Vapendavir, we have entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with Altesa Biosciences, Inc. (“Altesa”) In July 2021, permitting Altesa to develop and commercialize this capsid-binding broad spectrum antiviral. In May 2022, Altesa announced its intention to initiate clinical trials.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Relenza and Inavir are antivirals for the treatment of influenza, marketed by GlaxoSmithKline, plc (“GSK”) and Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (“Daiichi Sankyo”), respectively. We have earned royalties on the net sales of Relenza and Inavir in Japan. The last patent for Relenza expired in July 2019 and the last patent for Inavir expires in December 2029. Sales of these antivirals vary significantly by quarter, because influenza virus activity displays strong seasonal cycles, and by year depending on the intensity and duration of the flu season, the impact COVID-19 has had, and may continue to have, on seasonal influenza, and competition from other antivirals such as Tamiflu and Xofluza.

Our Tablet Vaccine Platform
 
Vaccines based on our proprietary VAAST platform are designed to generate broad and durable immune responses, which may offer important advantages in addressing a wide range of infectious diseases.
Platform Components
 
Our platform technology employs a vector-based approach and consists of the following components:
 

● | A vector, which is a virus used as a carrier to deliver DNA coding for vaccine antigens and an adjuvant selected to activate the immune system of the gut. Specifically, we use non-replicating adenovirus type 5 (“Ad5”), which delivers the DNA for both the antigen and adjuvant to the cells of the small intestine, where both the antigen and adjuvant are co-expressed.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A protein antigen, which is a viral or bacterial protein that stimulates an immune response to the targeted pathogen. We use a different antigen for each of our clinical vaccine candidates.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | An adjuvant, which is a substance that enhances the immune-stimulating properties of the vaccine. We use a Toll-like receptor 3 (“TLR3”) agonist, which was selected specifically for its ability to activate the immune system of the gut.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our proprietary enteric-coated tablet which is designed to deliver the Ad5 vector to the small intestine.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adenovirus Type 5 Vector
 
Ad5 is an extensively studied and well-characterized vector. Over 200 clinical trials conducted by others have used Ad5 for a wide range of applications, and we believe that using the same adenovirus in our tablet vaccine candidates will reduce regulatory risk, given that it is known to regulatory authorities.
 
    6 

  

Recombinant Antigen
 
Our vector contains cloning space where DNA encoding for any recombinant antigen can be inserted. In the vaccine programs pursued to date, we have chosen recombinant antigens that are known to be key targets of the immune system with the ability to generate protection against the corresponding pathogen. The Ad5 vector-adjuvant gene cassette allows for a modular approach.
Adjuvant
 
We use a short section of double-stranded RNA (“dsRNA”) as an adjuvant to enhance the immunogenicity of our tablet vaccine candidates. dsRNA is a TLR3 agonist and is recognized by the innate immune system as a signal that an undesired viral replication is ongoing, triggering it to mount an immune response in defense. dsRNA is one of the few signals available for use in the intestine as the natural large reservoir of bacteria (the “microbiome”) makes it difficult to use bacteria- related signals. We chose this adjuvant because of its ability to complement the non-replicating adenovirus when administered orally, and because very few pathways of immune system recognition signals occur in the small intestine. Importantly, our adjuvant is expressed within a cell, not provided as a separate component, resulting in a localized response.
 
Enteric-Coated Tablet
 
While tablets are typically used to deliver small molecules to the intestine, we have designed our tablets to deliver much larger adenovirus particles. We hold intellectual property related to the composition and formulation of our tablet vaccine candidates. Our tablet manufacturing does not require sterile fill and finish processing, such as for injectables, but rather uses standard tableting equipment.
 
How Our Tablet Vaccine Candidates Work
 
Our tablets are designed to deliver vaccines to the small intestine. The tablets are covered with a protective coating that remains intact in the low pH environment of the stomach and protects the active ingredient contained in the tablet core from the acidic environment in the stomach. The coating is designed to dissolve in the neutral pH environment of the small intestine which we are targeting to generate an optimal immune response. Once the coating has dissolved, the tablets disintegrate, and the vaccine is released into the small intestine where it can reach and enter the mucosal cells lining the intestine. Once inside the mucosal cells, the antigen protein and adjuvant are expressed, or manufactured, by the cells. The adjuvant is molecular in nature and always produced within the exact same intestinal cells that also produce the antigen. Importantly, the production of antigens delivered using our approach is identical to that of the actual pathogen when it invades the mucosa. In addition, we believe that delivering the replication incompetent Ad5-vectored vaccine via tablet directly to the gut avoids neutralization by blood or muscle tissue-based immune cells.
Figure 3. Our Oral Recombinant Vaccine Platform.
 
 

Figure 3. 1. Enteric-coated tablet is administered. The tablet coating protects the active ingredient from stomach acid degradation. 2. When the tablet reaches the small intestine, it releases the active ingredient, the viral vector, that can then transfect the epithelial cells in the mucosal epithelium and deliver the genes for the two payloads (antigen and adjuvant). 3. Expression of the antigen and adjuvant in the epithelial cells then leads to the TLR3 signaling cascade that can activate B and T cells.

Immune cells come in contact with proteins, and if the protein elicits an immune recognition signal, the immune cell becomes activated. This eventually leads to an immune response, producing either memory cells or large quantities of antibodies that bind to a key antigen. The expressed antigen and adjuvant of its platform, like other vaccines, cause induction of B and T cells specific for the antigen. Induction is believed to begin when an immature dendritic cell (specialized immune cell) absorbs an epithelial cell expressing both the antigen and adjuvant that were delivered by the Ad5 vector. Upon induction, dendritic cells migrate to the regional lymph nodes where they interact with recirculating naive B and T cells. The dendritic cell presents pieces of the antigen on its surface to stimulate T cells, and some of the antigen drains into the lymph node to stimulate B cells. Upon recognizing its specific antigen, small B or T cells stop migrating and enlarge. These then multiply in a clonal fashion and eventually recirculate to the tissues. B cells secrete antibodies that recognize the antigen and T cells find cells that have antigen presented on their surface and either kill the presenting cell or stimulate a local inflammatory response. A successful vaccination occurs if the B cells and T cells can form either memory cells (cells specialized to respond quickly to the protective antigen upon subsequent exposure) or enough antibody to a key antigen is made in large quantity to block infection.
 
The Significance of Mucosal Immunity and T Cell Responses
 
The immune system has developed defenses against pathogens by creating a special class of immune effectors, such as mucosal antibodies that are directed to wet surfaces and killer T cells that can kill pathogen infected cells. Most vaccines available today have been developed primarily to elicit blood circulating, or systemic B cell responses. However, there remain many infections, such as norovirus, for which no vaccines exist. These and other pathogens may need greater immune responses outside of serum antibodies. Organisms that cause these infections largely evade the antibody immune response generated by serum antibodies in the blood because the pathogenic organism can pass through cells that line the open, mucosal membranes without coming into direct contact with blood. Alternatively, the serum antibodies are unable to penetrate the cells infected by the pathogen.
 
Injectable vaccines available today typically do not induce mucosal immune responses, and subunit vaccines do not typically induce strong killer T cell immune responses, which are required to produce an effective level of immunization against several difficult pathogens. Administering vaccines through non-mucosal routes often leads to poor protection against mucosal pathogens primarily because such vaccines do not generate memory lymphocytes that migrate to mucosal surfaces. Although mucosal vaccination induces mucosa homing memory lymphocytes, we believe no complete mucosal recombinant oral vaccines are commercially available. Live attenuated vaccines can pose safety risks, whereas killed pathogens or molecular antigens are usually weak immunogens when applied to intact mucosa. Moreover, the immune mechanisms of protection against many mucosal infections are poorly understood.
 
One of the key benefits of our technology is delivery to the gastrointestinal tract, enabling the vaccine to directly enter the mucosal surface of the intestine and activate the immune system of the gut. Mucosal vaccine delivery is believed to enhance protection against mucosal pathogens by generating immunity at the very surface where such pathogens invade. Our tablet vaccine candidates target the mucosal immune cells with a vector-based approach and are designed to create a more potent cytotoxic T cell response and mucosal antibody response, which may provide more effective immunity for certain diseases. Besides robust mucosal and systemic antibody responses, we observed potent and poly-functional T cell responses in our human clinical trials, demonstrating that our tablet vaccine candidates efficiently activate both B and T cells.
 
Oral Non-Replicating Ad5 Vector is Designed to Circumvent Anti-Vector Issues
 
Injected Ad5 vectored vaccines generate strong anti-Ad5 responses, with up to a 100-fold increase in the anti-Ad5 neutralizing antibody titers. In contrast, our oral Ad5 vectored vaccine is designed to circumvent the complications related to anti-Ad5 immunity, allowing the platform to be used for multiple vaccines and repeat annual and booster vaccinations.

Anti-vector responses have been studied in our H1 influenza Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies, as well as in two norovirus Phase 1 studies. In the first H1 influenza oral tablet vaccine candidate study in 12 subjects, there were no significant rises in the neutralizing antibody titers to Ad5 following immunization. A Phase 2 challenge study was performed using the same H1 flu oral tablet vaccine candidate in more than 60 subjects. This study found a 2.2 geometric fold rise in neutralizing antibody titers to Ad5, compared to a rise of 1.1-fold in the placebo group. Finally, the rise in vaccine anti-vector immune responses were monitored in two Phase 1 norovirus vaccine candidate studies, study #101 and study #102. There were no significant increases in the neutralizing anti-Ad5 antibody titers following either one or two doses of the vaccine candidate, even at the high dose (see figure below).
 
Figure 4. Anti-vector titers pre- and post-immunization.
 
 
Figure 4. In the single dose 101 study, anti-vector titers were measured 28 days after the only dose. In the two-dose 102 study, these were measured 28 days after the second dose. No significant increase in Ad5 titers were observed in any group in the two studies.
 
In addition, in all studies to date, immune responses to the antigen of choice appeared to be independent from the recipient’s pre-existing anti-Ad5 immune status. In studies with our Ad5 vectored H1 influenza oral tablet vaccine candidate, the pre-existing antibody titers to Ad5 had no effect on the ability of the vaccine candidate to induce a neutralizing antibody response (by hemagglutinin inhibition or microneutralization assay) to influenza. In the two completed Phase 1 studies with our Ad5 vectored norovirus GI.1 oral tablet vaccine candidate, the ability of the vaccine candidate to generate a rise in antibody titers to norovirus or specifically blocking titers to norovirus virus-like particles (“VLP”) (BT50 assay), was not reduced in subjects with pre-existing anti-Ad5 antibody titers. These results are shown below. In conclusion, performance of our Ad5 vectored vaccine candidates delivered orally does not appear to be adversely affected by the pre-existing serum antibody status of the recipient.
 

Figure 5. Anti-vector immunity had no effect on the ability of the norovirus vaccine candidate to induce BT50 titers.
 

 

Figure 5. Subjects in the high dose groups were divided based on the preexisting anti-Ad5 titers on day 0. Those with titers ≥ 100 were considered Ad5 positive, those <100 were considered Ad5 negative. The fold increase in BT50 titers for each subject were plotted. Average increase in the BT50 titers for the Ad5 positive group were not lower than the BT50 Ad5 negative group.

Our Norovirus Program
 
Market Overview
 
Norovirus is the leading cause of vomiting and diarrhea from acute gastroenteritis among people of all ages in the United States. Each year, on average, norovirus causes 19 to 21 million cases of acute gastroenteritis and contributes to 109,000 hospitalizations and 900 deaths, mostly among young children and older adults. Typical symptoms include dehydration, which is the most common complication, vomiting, diarrhea with abdominal cramps, and nausea. In the U.S., we believe a norovirus vaccine would be beneficial for high-risk groups such as infants and children up to five years old, older adults and the elderly, as well as for workers in the food and travel industries, for healthcare, childcare and elder care workers, first responders, the military, and leisure and business travelers. In a study published by Johns Hopkins University and the CDC in 2016, the total global annual economic burden of norovirus was estimated at $60 billion, $34 billion of which occurred in high income countries including the United States. In a more recent health economic study published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases in July 2020 the economic impact to the U.S. was estimated to be $10.5 billion annually and in a January 2021 publication in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine the potential cost savings afforded by of a norovirus vaccine were estimated to be $500 per year in children under five and $75 per year in adults aged 65 and older. There are currently no approved vaccines or therapies to prevent or treat norovirus infection.
Our Norovirus Vaccine Candidate
 
We are developing a VP1-based bivalent oral tablet vaccine candidate that would protect against norovirus GI and norovirus GII, the two major norovirus genogroups affecting humans, by targeting the norovirus GI.1 Norwalk strain and the norovirus GII.4 Sydney strain. Because norovirus is an enteric pathogen that infects epithelial cells of the small intestine, we believe that a vaccine that produces antibodies against norovirus locally in the intestine, such as our tablet vaccine candidate which is delivered directly to the gut, may induce optimal protection against infection.
Preclinical Results
 
We have conducted multiple preclinical studies of our norovirus vaccine candidate in mice and ferrets. Overall, as compared in a head to head study with an injectable VP1 protein vaccine candidate in mice, our norovirus vaccine candidate generated comparable levels of serum antibody and superior levels of mucosal antibody to the VP1 injectable protein vaccine candidate.
Clinical Trials
 
We have completed four Phase 1 studies with our monovalent tableted norovirus GI.1 vaccine candidate and one Phase 1b study with our bivalent tableted vaccine candidate (co-administration of GI.1 and GII.4 vaccines). Three studies were completed pre-pandemic and two of the studies were completed more recently to evaluate dose interval and responses in an elderly population. In all studies, the primary endpoint was safety and the secondary endpoint was immunogenicity. In the bivalent study we also evaluated potential interference with co-administration.
 
We have two studies in progress, and one more study expected to start in 2023.
 
Studies Completed Pre-Pandemic: 101, 102 and 103
 
101. This Phase 1 study was designed to evaluate the norovirus vaccine candidate (VXA-GI.1-NN). 66 healthy adults were randomized in three groups, with 23 subjects receiving a single low dose of 1 x 1010 IU, 23 subjects receiving a single high dose of 1 x 1011 IU, and 20 subjects receiving the matching placebo control.
 
102. This Phase 1 open-label, dose optimization study was designed to evaluate the norovirus GI.1 monovalent vaccine candidate (VXA-GI.1-NN) in 60 subjects given multiple doses with some differences in schedule for the lower dose groups. The first three groups enrolled (N=15 each) used low doses of 1 x 1010 infectious units ("IU"). Group A received two doses of VXA-GI.1-NN on days 0 and 7, group B received three doses on days 0, 2, and 4, and group C received two doses on days 0 and 28. The fourth group, group D (N=15), evaluated two high doses of 1 x 1011 IU given on days 0 and 28. The primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of all dosing regimens and the secondary endpoint was to compare immunogenicity between groups by BT50 titers and antibody secreting cells (ASC) counts.
 
103. This Phase 1 study was designed to evaluate the bivalent norovirus vaccine candidate administration (VXA-GI.1-NN and VXA-GII.4-NS). 80 healthy adults were randomized into one of four treatment groups. Treatment Group 1 had an open-label sentinel group of five subjects who were enrolled prior to initiation of the subsequent treatment groups. The five sentinel subjects received the monovalent GII.4 vaccine candidate and were monitored for safety and immunogenicity. Randomization was 1:1:2:1 for Treatment Groups 1 through 4 respectively, with subjects randomized to monovalent GI.1, monovalent GII.2, bivalent GI.1/GII.4, or placebo arms. Patients received the complete investigational dose of 5 × 1010 IU within the monovalent vaccine treatment arms and 1x 1011 IU in the bivalent treatment arm or placebo tablets.

Safety Summary from the First Three Studies.
 
One hundred seventy-one subjects were treated with Vaxart’s norovirus vaccine candidates in these three Phase 1 studies. The vaccine candidates were generally well tolerated. The most common solicited adverse event across all doses was headache (27.5%), which was similar to the 28.6% of subjects with headache in the placebo group. Most solicited adverse events (“AEs”) were transient and of mild or moderate severity, and there were no discontinuations due to solicited AEs. In two of the studies there was a higher incidence of diarrhea (20.5%) reported in the vaccine candidate treatment groups versus the placebo group (11.4%). However, in the high dose group in the 102 study, there was only one subject (6.7%) reporting diarrhea even after receiving two administrations of vaccine candidate at the highest dose. These results in total suggest that there were no dose dependent effects that impacted safety. There were no severe treatment-related unsolicited adverse events reported in any of these studies, and no related severe adverse events (“SAEs”), notable observations of clinical interest (“NOCIs’) or adverse events of special interest (“AESIs”).

Immunogenicity Results-Study 101
 
Several different assays were used to assess immunogenicity to the norovirus vaccine candidate. These results were published in Kim, et al, JCI Insight, 2018. Key immunological results are described below.
 
BT50 Titers. The primary immunological endpoint was to measure antibody titers by an assay that assessed the ability of antibodies to block interaction of a norovirus VLP to histogroup blood antigen (HGBA). This assay is known as the BT50 (for 50% inhibition of blocking titer) assay. BT50 titers were assessed using Leb synthetic glycan as the coating antigen. Titers rose in the vaccine candidate recipients, and at all timepoints (Figure M1). By the Leb BT50 assay, 14/23 (61%) of the subjects in the low dose group, and 18/23 (78%) in the high dose group, had at least a two-fold rise. One subject in the placebo group had a greater than two-fold rise. On Day 28, the geometric mean titer (GMT) for the low dose vaccine candidate group was 59.0, a 2.3-fold geometric mean fold rise (“GMFR”) over the initial GMT of 26.2 at baseline. The GMT for the high dose vaccine candidate group was 98.5, a 3.8-fold GMFR over the initial GMT of 25.8 at baseline. The high dose group was significantly increased over placebo on day 28 (P=0.0003). Complete results are given in the table below (Table 4).

Antibody Secreting Cell (ASC). The ability of the norovirus vaccine candidate to induce norovirus specific B cells in the peripheral blood was measured by ASC assay. This assay essentially counts the number of B cells that emerge after immunization and recognize norovirus in the peripheral blood. The number that circulate in the blood pre-immunization is very low, so the assay is a meaningful way to evaluate the vaccine specific effects. In the low dose group, 16 of 23 (70%) of subjects responded and in the high dose group, 19 of 23 (83%) of subjects responded on day seven for both IgA and IgG ASCs (Figure M2). Background ASCs were generally negligible on day 0. For the high dose vaccine candidate treated group, an average of 561 IgA ASCs and 278 IgG ASCs each per 1 x 106 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (“PBMC”), were found on day 7. For the low dose vaccine candidate treated group, an average of 372 IgA ASCs and 107 IgG ASCs per 1 x 106 PBMC were found on day 7. The placebo group had no responders with an average of 3.3 spots for IgA ASCs and 2.2 spots for IgG ASCs per 1 x 106 PBMC on day 7. The treated groups were significantly different than placebo in terms of the ability to elicit an IgG or an IgA ASC response at day 7 (P<0.0001, Mann-Whitney). There was no statistical difference in the number of spots for IgA and IgG ASCs between the high and low dose groups (P=0.21 for IgA, P=0.28 for IgG).

Fecal IgA. Norovirus VP1 specific mucosal IgA was explored directly by looking at fecal samples. Because the quantity of IgA is highly variable within these samples, total IgA was also measured and the ratio between VP1- specific IgA/total IgA for each sample was examined. Samples with IgA levels below the detection limit were excluded from analysis. The increase in the ratio of specific IgA to total IgA was measured between baseline and day 28 (and baseline and day 180 for fecal IgA). In the high dose group, 9 of 19 (47%) fecal samples were responders with a four-fold rise or greater IgA response at day 28, and 9 of 21 (43%) at day 180 (Figure M3). The average fold increases in specific IgA/total IgA ratio were 17.2 and 9.7. These results are significantly higher than the placebo group where 2/18 (11%) and 0/16 (0%) were found to have fourfold or better increases on days 28 and 180 (P=0.029 and P=0.0049 respectively), with average increases of 1.8 and 1.0 (Figure M3). The low dose group had a similar response as the high dose, with 7 of 20 (35%) and 5 of 16 (31%) with fourfold or greater increases on days 28 and 180 respectively. The number of responders trended higher than placebo on day 28, but the difference was statistically significant on day 180 (P=0.13 and 0.043). The low dose group had a 36.2-fold increase on day 28, and a 5.6-fold increase on day 180 (Figure M3).

BT50 Titers. The objective of the study was to compare schedules and dosing for the ability to elicit immune responses, particularly by evaluating BT50 titers. BT50 titers were assessed at multiple times points, given that multiple doses were given. In the high dose group, 12 of 15 subjects had a two-fold or greater increase in BT50 titers after the first dose and 14 of 15 subjects (92%) had a two-fold or greater increase in BT50 titers after two doses. The GMT titer rose from 21.3 on day to 85.1 on day 28 for a 3.8 GMFR. The GMT at day 56 were measured to be 75.8, a GMFR of 3.6 over the baseline values. Other groups given lower doses of vaccine had lower response rates. Groups A and C had higher increases in the titers compared to Group B, although this is not statistically significant. An ANCOVA model was used to determine the statistical significance of the increases in GMFR. Least-squares (“LS”) geometric mean titers (“LSGMTs”) and LS geometric mean fold rises (“LSGMFRs”) were calculated by exponentiating the least square mean (“LSMs”) from the ANCOVA model, which included log-transformed post baseline titer or log-transformed change from baseline titer as a dependent variable, cohort as a factor, and baseline log-titer as a covariate. The significance in the different groups to increase the GMFR (test is LSGMFR=0), was found to be P=0.0008, 0.1224, 0.0004, and <0.0001 for groups A through D respectively at day 56. This means all groups had statistically significant increases in the GMT except for group B, which had a more modest increase in the titers (Table 5).

ASCs. Additional immunological analysis was performed by comparing the ASC responders between groups. The high dose group had 14 out of 15 subjects respond to the vaccine candidate, with an average IgA ASC count of 698 per 1x106 cells. Following a second dose, the subject that didn’t respond the first time had a significant increase in ASC counts so all 15 subjects (100%) were able to elicit an ASC response following two doses. As typical, subjects that had a high number of ASC counts after the first immunization had a low response after the 2nd dose. The low dose groups were compared by examining the overall response rate, since the dosing and the analysis were performed at different intermediate timepoints. Group A had the highest overall response rate where 12/14 subjects (86%) were able to induce meaningful ASC responses after one or two doses. Slightly lower responders were observed in group B, where only a few subjects had a response after the first dose, but more subjects responded after additional vaccine doses. Group C had the most variable responses of any group. The average number of spots was 839 per 1x106 cells after the first dose, but this was the result of several subjects having extremely high numbers of spots (three subjects had greater than 1500 per 1x106), mixed with many subjects that didn’t respond at all.

Immunogenicity Results – Study 103
 
BT50 Titers. There was a significant increase in the titers of serum GI.1 HBGA blocking antibodies by BT50 at Day 29 in the Monovalent GI.1 and Bivalent GII.4/GI.1 from Day 1 values. There was a significant increase in the GMT of serum GII.4 HBGA blocking antibodies by BT50 at Day 29 in the Monovalent GII.4 and Bivalent GII.4/GI.1 from Day 1 values. Serum assays such as the BT50 showed a two- to three-fold increase in titer and a 50% seroconversion rate. No significant differences in the GMT of serum GI.1 HBGA blocking antibodies by BT50 were seen between the Monovalent GI.1 and Bivalent GII.4/GI.1 groups. No significant differences in the GMT of Serum GII.4 BT50 GMT were seen between the Monovalent GII.4 and Bivalent GII.4/GI.1 groups.
Antibody Secreting Cell (ASC). The ability of the vaccine candidate to induce norovirus specific B cells in the peripheral blood was measured by ASC assay. This assay essentially counts the number of B cells that emerge after immunization and recognize norovirus in the peripheral blood. The number that circulate in the blood pre-immunization is very low, so the assay is a meaningful way to evaluate the vaccine specific effects.
 
The average counts of GI.1 IgA ASC were similar across treatment groups on Day 1, representing background levels of circulating norovirus specific B cells. However, on Day 8, statistically significant increases in the average counts of GI.1 IgA ASC were seen in the Monovalent GI.1 group (p<0.0001), Bivalent GII.4/GI.1 group (p<0.0001), and Monovalent GII.4 group (p=0.0001) compared with placebo (Figure M4). No significant differences in the average counts of GI.1 IgA ASC were seen between the Monovalent GI.1 and Bivalent GII.4/GI.1 groups (p=0.6013). The number of subjects with a response was highest in the Monovalent GI.1 group (85.7%) compared with the Bivalent GII.4/GI.1 group (77.8%) and the Monovalent GII.4 group (68.4%). These were not significantly different. 
 
The average counts of GII.4 IgA ASC were similar across treatment groups on Day 1. However, on Day 8, statistically significant increases in the average counts of GII.4 IgA ASC were seen in the Bivalent GII.4/GI.1 group (p<0.0001), Monovalent GII.4 group (p<0.0001) and Monovalent GI.1 group (p=0.0080) compared with placebo. No significant differences in the average counts of GI.1 IgA ASC were seen between the Monovalent GII.4 and Bivalent GII.4/GI.1 groups (p=0.6079). The number of subjects with a response was highest in the Bivalent GII.4/GI.1 group (92.6%), compared with the Monovalent GI.1 group (89.5%), and the Monovalent GI.1 group (14.3%).
 
The average counts of ASC GI.1 IgG were similar across treatment groups on Day 1. However, on Day 8, statistically significant increases in the average counts of ASC GI.1 IgG were seen in the Monovalent GII.4 group (p=0.0002), Monovalent GI.1 group (p=0.0019), and the Bivalent GII.4/GI.1 group (p<0.0001) compared with placebo (Figure M4). No significant differences in the average counts of ASC GI.1 IgG were seen between the Monovalent GI.1 and Bivalent GII.4/GI.1 groups (p=0.4172). The number of subjects with the ASC responses was highest in the Bivalent GII.4/GI.1 group (81.5%) compared with the Monovalent GI.1 group (57.1%), Monovalent GII.4 group (47.4%), and placebo group (6.7%).
 
The average counts of ASC GII.4 IgG were similar across treatment groups on Day 1. However, on Day 8, statistically significant increases in the average counts of ASC GII.4 IgG were seen in the Bivalent GII.4/GI.1 group (p<0.0001) and Monovalent GII.4 group (p<0.0001) compared with placebo. No significant differences in the average counts of ASC GII.4 IgG were seen between the Monovalent GII.4 and Bivalent GII.4/GI.1 groups (p=0.2694). Number of subjects with response was highest in the Bivalent GII.4/GI.1 group (92.6%) compared with Monovalent GII.4 group (84.2%) and Monovalent GII.4 group (14.3%).

Figure M4. The different groups were assessed for IgA and IgG ASC counts in the peripheral blood on Study Day 8 (seven days post immunization). Individual subjects were assessed for both GII.4 (purple) and GI.1 (orange) and plotted as a dot, with the average response for the group shown with a solid black line. These results show that the bivalent group could induce IgA and IgG responses to both GI.1 and GII.4, compared to the placebo group where no significant ASC responses were observed. Further, the monovalent and bivalent groups had similar average responses, demonstrating a lack of interference when the two vaccine strains were given together.

Recently Completed Norovirus Trials
 
Booster to the 103 study. This trial was designed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of an annual booster norovirus vaccine candidate, by giving a subset of volunteers that received either the G1.1 vaccine candidate or the bivalent G1.1/G2.4 vaccine candidate an additional G1.1 vaccine candidate dose after 16 months. The active portion of the bivalent Phase 1 trial was completed in 2019, and topline results were reported in the third quarter of 2019. A booster dose for a subset of subjects was initiated in early 2021 to further evaluate safety and immunogenicity of the norovirus vaccine candidate. In results announced in July 2021, we reported that we were able to successfully boost immune responses with the G1.1 norovirus vaccine candidate in prior vaccinated subjects. These responses include IgA antibody secreting cells, as well as IgG and IgA serum antibody responses. Solicited AEs after the boost dose were comparable to initial dosing with headache being the most frequently reported symptom (25%). Most AEs were mild, with few moderate and no severe solicited or unsolicited AEs after booster. No SAEs, AESIs or NOCIs were reported.
 
104. Phase 1 Norovirus Age Escalation Trial. Sixty-six volunteers ages 55-80 were administered oral VXA-G1.1-NN tablets by prime and boost twenty-nine days apart to ascertain safety and immunogenicity. Four different cohorts were enrolled in a placebo-controlled study, with three vaccine cohorts: low, medium, and high (1x1010 IU, 3x1010 IU, and 1x1011IU). Solicited symptoms (SS) were recorded for 7 days following each immunization and unsolicited adverse events were captured for 28 days post dose. To determine systemic humoral immunogenicity, VP1-specific serum IgG and IgA were evaluated by MSD and functional activity determined by BT50. Cellular immunity was measured by antibody secreting cell (ASC) assays. Lastly, VP1-specific mucosal IgA responses were quantified in subject saliva and nasal samples and normalized to total IgA.
 
VXA-G1.1-NN was safe and well tolerated in all groups, with few reported solicited adverse events in either vaccine candidate or placebo cohorts. Most solicited AEs were mild or moderate, with no vaccine-related severe solicited AEs at any dose level. Nominal unsolicited AEs were recorded during the active period, all unrelated, with none reported in those receiving the highest dose. One year safety follow up is ongoing at this time. (Table 6).

Immunological Results
 
In the cohorts receiving vaccine, serum BT50 titers, VP1-specific IgG and VP1-specific IgA all increased in a dose-dependent manner and remained above baseline levels through day 210 post vaccination (Figure M5) with mean rises in responses between 20-50 fold observed in the high dose group. All vaccine candidate groups elicited strong IgA ASC responses, with the highest vaccine candidate dose generating the most robust responses (Figure M6). Elevated VP1-specific IgA was detected in the saliva and nasal secretions 29 days post immunization (Figure M7), demonstrating that this enterically administered NV vaccine induces mucosal crosstalk in multiple tissues.

Study 105. Boost interval study.
 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the immunogenicity of VXA-G1.1-NN with repeat-dose administration at Day 1 and varying boost schedules (4, 8, or 12 weeks post initial dose) in healthy adults aged 18 to 55. Several vaccine modalities have found that increasing the time between the prime and booster doses can increase the responses observed. This was an open-label study in healthy adult subjects aged 18 to 55 years old to determine whether there are advantages of waiting longer between prime and booster doses. The study enrolled 30 subjects divided into 1 of 3 treatment cohorts; 10 subjects each received 2 doses of 1x1010 Infectious Units (IU) on Day 1 and Week 4, 10 subjects each received 2 doses of 1x1010 IU at Day 1 and Week 8, and 10 subjects each received 2 doses of 1x1010 IU at Day 1 and Week 12.
 
VXA-G1.1-NN was safe and well tolerated in all dosing regimens. All solicited AEs were mild or moderate. There were no vaccine related unsolicited AEs reported (Table 7).

Immunogenicity Results:
 
Administration of VXA-G1.1-NN elicited vaccine-specific immune responses (including GI.1 VP1 specific serum IgG and IgA, GI.1 specific serum blocking antibodies [BT50], and GI.1 VP1 specific IgG and IgA ASC responses) in all cohorts, after both the first dose and the second boost dose. Seven days after the second dose of VXA-G1.1-NN, there was a tendency for higher mean values of GI.1 VP1 specific IgA ASC in the 8-week and 12-week boost cohorts when compared to the 4‑week boost cohort. Twenty-eight days after the second dose administration, there were no statistically significant differences in geometric mean concentration and geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) in GI.1 VP1 specific serum IgG among all cohorts (or between any cohorts) with varying boost schedules, however, a tendency for higher GMFR was noted in the 8-week and 12-week boost cohorts when compared to the 4‑week boost cohort. While no statistically significant differences (Fisher´s exact test) were observed 28 days after the second dose among the different boost cohorts in subjects with a ≥3-fold (P_overall = 0.19) or 4‑fold (P overall = 0.72) increase in GI.1 VP1 serum IgA, a distinct trend was noted with a higher number of responders in the 8-week and 12‑week cohorts when compared to the 4-week cohort. Twenty-eight days after the second dose, statistically significant differences were demonstrated in subjects who showed a ≥2-fold increase in GI.1 VP1 specific serum IgA among all 3 cohorts (P_overall = 0.04). Subjects in the 8-week boost cohort had a significantly higher (P1 = 0.03) ≥2‑fold increase in GI.1 VP1 specific serum IgA in comparison to subjects in the 4‑week boost cohort.
 
Trials Expected to be Completed in 2023 
 
Phase 2 Norovirus GI.1 Strain Challenge Study (VXA-NVV-201). A Phase 2 challenge study with our monovalent GI.1 norovirus vaccine candidate in young adult participants was initiated in the first quarter of 2022 and is currently underway. This study is randomized, double-blinded, and placebo controlled and will evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy of the GI.1 norovirus vaccine candidate following GI.1 viral challenge. We expect to challenge between 100 and 150 participants and report topline data from this study in the third quarter of 2023.
Phase 2 Dose Ranging Trial (VXA-NVV-202). This trial will assess the safety and immunogenicity of the bivalent vaccine candidate in an expanded population of adults ages 18 to 80 years old to allow confirmation of the dose with which to proceed into with larger Phase 3 trials. This Phase 2 clinical trial is expected to enroll approximately 135 healthy adults at three sites in the United States. The first 10 subjects will receive open label high-dose vaccine and the remaining subjects will be randomized to high- or low-dose vaccine (N=50 for each arm) or placebo (N=25). Two different dose levels will be explored, 5e10 IU per vaccine, and 1e11 IU per vaccine for total bivalent doses of 1e11 and 2e11 IU. Top-line data from this Phase 2 clinical trial is expected in the middle of 2023, and the study is designed to allow us to select the dose that we intend to use in Phase 3. 
Path to Approval. Upon dose selection, a follow-on Phase 2 study will enroll an estimated 500 subjects which we expect will generate sufficient safety data at the selected dose to enable us to have an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA to gain concurrence on the scope and design of the Phase 3 pivotal efficacy study in adults over 18 years of age that would support licensure.
Additional Age Groups and Subpopulations
 
Pediatric Population. Our current tablet vaccine formulation is designed for delivery to the gut in solid dosage form using an enteric-coated tablet which we believe is the optimal vaccine delivery system for the adult population and children eight years and older. For children six months to seven years in age, we plan to develop minitablet formulations that can deliver the vectored vaccine intact to the gut. Development of our norovirus vaccine in the pediatric population will proceed with a stepdown approach through progressively younger age segments (i.e. 8 to 5 years, 4 to 2 years, 2 years to 6 months).
 
Study 108. We are currently partnering with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to execute a phase 1 norovirus bivalent vaccine candidate study in 76 healthy, lactating post-partum, women volunteers, to determine the impact of our norovirus vaccine construct on breast milk norovirus specific IgA and its potential presence, post-breastfeeding, within infant fecal samples. The study will be randomized, double-blinded, and placebo controlled and will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the placebo cohorts and two vaccine cohorts: medium dose (1×1011 IU) and high dose (2×1011 IU). As noted in the preclinical section, a mucosal vaccine might have advantages in creating antibodies that are able to block transmission of virus, reducing the local spread. Further studies would be required, but this may provide an additional way to immunize young infants and protect the whole family from the serious consequences of norovirus infection. This trial is expected to start in 2023.

Our COVID-19 Program
 
Market Overview
 
Vaccines for COVID-19 have been purchased at large scale by governments for mass distribution within countries. In addition, non-government organizations (“NGOs”) and the World Health Organization have set-up purchasing organizations such as COVAX to purchase on behalf of countries without domestic manufacturing and/or with limited resources to make pre-purchase agreements. This central government purchasing is most likely to continue in 2023 in most countries globally, with an exception being the United States which has telegraphed its intention to have the private market sector manage COVID-19 vaccine purchases and distribution in 2023 and beyond. The first wave of COVID-19 vaccines have been effective in Phase 3 trials against the original strain of SARS-CoV-2, however distribution and administration issues were much slower than anticipated because of the storage and handling requirements for these vaccines.
 
The first-generation vaccines seem to have varying levels of efficacy to emerging strains of SARS-CoV-2. The previous selective pressure of strain adaptation had been in an environment of very low levels of a vaccinated or infected public. Strain change may increase in speed as the vaccinated population grows.
 
There was significant vaccine hesitancy reported before the COVID-19 vaccines were offered to the public; in some countries more than 50% of the population stated they would not take a COVID-19 vaccine. This vaccine hesitancy seems to be waning as more people are vaccinated without serious adverse events and may end up being similar to rates of vaccine hesitancy for other vaccines such as the influenza vaccine.
 
Variability of the Circulating Strains of SARS-CoV-2
 
SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that naturally evolves genetic mutations over time producing numerous viral variants. Since December 2019 coordinated global efforts have traced the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, and identified frequent genetic mutations occurring in multiple countries. Viral variants rapidly emerged in many regions of the world, have several genomic changes leading to significant shifts in amino acid sequence and protein structure. During the second half of 2020, three divergent SARS-CoV-2 variants quickly spread - Alpha (B.1.1.7), which originated in the United Kingdom, Beta (B.1.351), which originated in South Africa and Gamma (P.1), which originated in Brazil. In 2021, two additional variants of concern (VOC) have appeared called Delta (B.1.617.2), which originated in India, and Omicron (B.1.1.529), which originated in Botswana. All variants have alterations in key regions of the outer S protein which is utilized by the virus to infect human cells through a receptor called ACE2. Structural changes in the receptor binding portion of the S protein in these variants have been shown to enhanced viral transmission, possibly leading to higher viral loads and worse disease outcomes. More recent data shows that variants have substantial ability to circumvent serum antibodies from the vaccines (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04387-1_reference.pdf). Currently, most vaccine strategies under development or approved for emergency use by the FDA, employ the S protein as a vaccine antigen to elicit antibodies responses to block the SARS-CoV-2 virus from entering cells. The original vaccine formulations comprise of the S protein are derived from the original Wuhan strain and some of the more recent vaccines are formulated with a bivalent Omicron/Wuhan strain combination. Current injectable vaccines have difficulty in keeping up with the newest/currently predominant circulating SARS-CoV-2 strain(s). As such, these injectable vaccines may not elicit cross protective antibody responses that block new viral variants from binding to the receptor and entering cells. The recent Omicron outbreak showed that three mRNA vaccinations could induce some protection against severe disease and hospitalization, but only 37% protection against infection (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.30.21268565v1.full.pdf). These results indicate that, as novel S protein variants continue to emerge, current vaccination approaches will need to be updated or modified to provide sufficient protection against new SARS-CoV-2 mutants. Alternatively, new approaches are needed which create cross-reactive (pan-coronavirus or pan-betacoronavirus) antibodies and T cells.

Our COVID-19 Vaccine Candidates
 
We have spent significant effort developing COVID-19 vaccine candidates over the past few years.  The data generated are detailed on the following pages and show our COVID-19 vaccine candidate has induced cross-reactivity in clinical trials, which is relevant for developing a vaccine responsive to future coronavirus pandemics.
 
Our first COVID-19 vaccine candidate (rAd-S-N, known as Vaxart clinical candidate VXA-CoV2-1) expresses two different genes from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the spike protein and the nucleoprotein (“N”). The N protein is more conserved among the coronavirus family of viruses, and inclusion in our vaccine candidate was done in order to create a T cell target even if new and emerging strains of SARS-CoV-2 had substantial mutations in the S protein, thereby reducing the ability of the vaccine to create protective immune responses that recognize the S from these strains. Our candidate was chosen in spring of 2020 based on preclinical results in mice showing that the construct had the ability to elicit antibody and T cell responses in mice, as well as mucosal IgA against SARS-CoV-2 in lungs.
 
Our second vaccine candidate (rAd-S, known as Vaxart clinical candidate VXA-CoV2-1.1-S) expresses only the S protein from SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain. This candidate made improved antibody immune responses in a non-human primate (“NHP”) study compared to other vaccine candidates and was able to inhibit transmission in a hamster transmission experiment.
 
We have also initiated preclinical work on additional COVID-19 vaccine candidates with the goal of developing a potential pan-betacoronavirus vaccine.
 
Preclinical Results
 
In order to evaluate efficacy of our first COVID-19 vaccine candidate, we conducted a hamster challenge study at Lovelace Biomedical (Albuquerque, NM). Hamsters are a good model of SARS-CoV-2 infection because they can be infected via the intranasal route, and can get clinical symptoms such as weight loss, labored breathing, and ruffled fur. They also get lung problems similar to humans. Microcomputed tomographic imaging of hamsters given SARS-CoV-2 revealed severe lung injury that shared characteristics with SARS-CoV-2−infected human lung, including severe multi-lobular ground glass opacity, and regions of lung consolidation. 
 
Our topline results showed that two oral administrations of VXA-CoV2-1 (rAd-S-N) at 1e9 IU could substantially protect hamsters from weight loss associated with infection (Figure N1A), protect against the lung weight gain associated with lung CoV-2 mediated damage (Figure N1B), and substantially protect against high viral titers in the lungs five days post challenge (Figure. N1C). Oral vaccination with VXA-CoV2-1 reduced the viral titers in the lungs four to five logs (Figure N1C). Histopathological comparisons between the lungs of untreated animals and VXA-CoV2-1 oral immunized animals showed substantial differences. All untreated animals had mostly moderate (six of eight animals) to marked (two of eight animals) mixed cell inflammation, minimal (one of eight animals) to moderate (two of eight animals) epithelial hypertrophy/hyperplasia in centriacinar areas, mostly minimal (five of eight animals) to mild (three of eight animals) alveolar hemorrhage, and mild (eight of eight animals) epithelial hypertrophy/hyperplasia in the bronchi. All animals that received two doses of the vaccine VXA-CoV2-1 had minimal mixed cell inflammation. There was no evidence of epithelial hypertrophy/hyperplasia in centriacinar areas, alveolar hemorrhage or epithelial hypertrophy/hyperplasia in the bronchi of these animals. Control vaccination by intranasal (i.n.) delivery of VXA-CoV2-1 also induced a similar level of protection as oral delivery. 
 
The vaccine induced antibody responses in the serum of animals, with both binding Immunoglobulin G (“IgG”) antibodies to S1, as well as neutralizing antibodies measured after oral or intranasal immunization (Figure N2). Neutralizing antibody titers were measured using the surrogate neutralizing assay (Genscript). The IgG ELISA titers to S increased after boosting the animals in the fourth week of the study.
 
The second clinical candidate was explored in non-human primate ("NHP") and hamster studies in 2021.  In a study funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and managed by Duke University, hamsters were used to model aerosol transmission from vaccine breakthrough.  Given that even fully vaccinated people are getting infected with the latest variants of concern, and can infect other people, strategies that impact SARS-CoV-2 transmission may be beneficial.  Index hamsters were vaccinated with two doses of oral r-Ad-S (aka VXA-CoV2-1.1-S), using intranasal ("IN") r-Ad-S as a control for mucosal stimulation, intramuscular spike protein (IM S) as a protein control, and oral PBS as a mock control. Index animals were then infected via IN delivery, with a high titer of SARS-CoV-2 to replicate a post-vaccination breakthrough infection. One-day post viral challenge, index hamsters were placed upstream of vaccine-naïve hamsters in a chamber that allowed aerosol movement but not direct contact or fomite transmission. Importantly, oral and IN r-Ad-S vaccination significantly decreased or delayed aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure N3A) and reduced disease indicators such as lung inflammation and weight loss in unvaccinated naïve animals (Figure N3E-G), despite the presence of substantial viral RNA in nasal swabs of index immunized animals.  These data demonstrate that oral r-Ad-S immunization resulted in reduced disease and decreased SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the preclinical model, even to unvaccinated/unprotected animals. 
 
NHP studies were used to measure immunogenicity among different vaccine candidates.  NHPs were immunized with rAd5 by intranasal administration of 5x1010 IU on days 1 and 30. Four cynomolgus monkeys per group received vaccine test articles: ED88 (rAd5-S-N Wuhan), ED90 (rAd-S Wuhan), ED94 (rAd-S beta) and the naïve group received Saline.  A fourth group received an intramuscular injection of purified S protein (from the NIH) on day 1 followed by a boost administration of ED88 on day 30. Animals vaccinated with ED90 induced elevated serum IgG antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan, Beta, Delta S proteins compared to ED88 (Figure N4). Animals immunized with ED90 elicited serum specific IgG to both full length trimerized S and receptor binding domain (RBD).  IgA specific responses to Wuhan, Delta and Beta S proteins were measured. Animals that were immunized with ED90 had higher IgA responses against Wuhan, Delta, and Beta strains compared to ED88 vaccinated animals. ED90 had similar responses to ED94 against the Beta variant S protein, but outperformed ED94 against the Wuhan and Delta variants. In summary, the ED90 vaccine candidate induced better serum and mucosal antibody responses against important SARS-CoV-2 variants in the NHPs compared other candidates, and was advanced into the clinic as clinical vaccine candidate VXA-CoV2-1.1-S.

Clinical Trial
 Phase 1 - VXA-COV2-101
 
The Phase 1 study utilized an open-label, dose-ranging design to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of VXA-CoV2-1 administered orally to healthy adult volunteers. Under the Phase 1 protocol 35 participants were enrolled (October - November 2020) and received either a low dose (n=20) or mid dose (n=15) of the vaccine VXA-CoV2-1. Five subjects in the low dose group received a boost four weeks after their initial vaccination. Study participants were followed for safety and immunogenicity for four weeks following their last vaccination, and then entered a safety follow-up period which lasted for one year following their last vaccination. Seven of the initial 35 participants were enrolled in an additional boost extension substudy and, between October and November 2021, received a boost with VXA-CoV2-1.1-S at approximately 12 months post initial vaccination. The boost substudy participants were then followed for 4 weeks post boost vaccination an additional one year safety follow-up period.
 
Male or female volunteers who were between the ages of 18 to 54 years with body mass index (BMI) between 17 and 30 kg/m2 at screening, inclusive who are at low risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, screened negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of screening and were in general good health, without significant medical illness, based on medical history, physical examination, vital signs, and clinical laboratories (complete blood count, chemistry, and urinalysis) as determined by the investigator in consultation with the medical monitor and sponsor were eligible to participate in this study. Post confirmation of eligibility, 5 sentinel subjects were enrolled into Cohort 1 and immunized with the low dose (1x1010 IU ± 0.5 log) VXA-CoV2-1 oral vaccine.
 
The primary objective was to determine the safety of VXA-CoV2-1. Safety and tolerability were evaluated through the detection and documentation of solicited symptoms of reactogenicity (seven days post each vaccination), unsolicited AEs (through 28 days post last vaccination (Day 29); Day 57 for Cohort 1), SAEs, MAAEs, including evidence of COVID-19, and vaccine enhanced disease (through Day 360). Clinical laboratory (blood chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) results, physical examination, and vital signs results were also assessed.
 
Eligible subjects in all three cohorts were invited to receive a boost with VXA-CoV2-1.1-S at a dose of 1x1011 IU ±0.5 log at approximately12 months post initial vaccination with VXA-CoV2-1. After re-confirmation of eligibility, seven subjects reconsented and enrolled into the additional boost extension substudy. Only subjects who had not received any additional vaccinations for COVID-19 following the initial study vaccination(s) with VXA-CoV2-1, and who had not reported symptomatic COVID-19 and/or tested positive for SARS-CoV2-1 infection during the study period (active and safety follow-up) were eligible to participate in the boost substudy.

Safety Results
 
VXA-COV2-101 - Solicited symptoms were reported by 37% of study participants (13 out of 35 subjects), with more subjects reporting symptoms in the mid dose (60%) versus the low dose (20%). The most commonly reported solicited symptoms were nausea (27%), vomiting (27%) and diarrhea (27%). Most reported solicited symptoms were mild to moderate in severity and resolved without the need for medical treatment; additionally, no subjects discontinued due to a solicited adverse events.
 


Five subjects (14%) experienced unsolicited AEs through Day 57. Two subjects experienced unsolicited AEs that were considered related to study treatment: Grade 1 oropharyngeal pain (Day 2 to Day 5) and Grade 1 chills on Day 7. All unsolicited AEs were mild in severity and resolved without the need for medical treatment. Four of the 35 subjects from the main study did not complete the main study safety follow-up period. There were no SAEs reported during this period.
 
VXA-COV2-101 Boost - In the boost substudy, three of seven (43%) boosted subjects reported solicited AEs post boost vaccination. Solicited AEs reported were headache (29%), malaise/fatigue (29%), and nausea (14%). All solicited AEs following the boost dose were mild or moderate in severity. There were no severe solicited AEs and none required use of concomitant medications.
 


One unrelated unsolicited AE (wound) was reported during the boost substudy active period. There were no related AEs or SAEs.  All seven subjects completed the boost active period. Four subjects were followed through 12 months post boost dose and 3 subjects withdrew after 180 days of safety follow-up. There were no SAEs or MAAEs reported during the boost safety follow-up.
 
Immunogenicity Results
 
T cell Polarization and T cell Induction.  As part of the anti-viral immune response, T cells are important as they can act as specific ‘killers’ that can seek out and destroy viral infected cells to control infection and prevent severity of disease. Vaccination with a COVID-19 vaccine candidate (such as with VXA-CoV2-1) should induce an increase in T cells that recognize SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. However, T cells can produce either a protective (Th1) or an allergic response (Th2) upon activation. A primary immunological endpoint in this clinical study was to measure the polarization of the SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells, whether it was towards a protective Th1 response or an allergic Th2 response. This was measured using a restimulation assay where peripheral blood mononuclear cells (“PBMCs”) taken both pre- and post-vaccination were cultured with SARS-CoV-2 peptides from either the spike protein (S) or Nucleoprotein (N) and the Th1/Th2 responses were measured. 26 pairs of PBMC samples from day one and day eight were able to be assessed from the study, pre and post a single dose; the remaining samples were not either not available or of poor quality to assess. No significant increase of Th2 responses, defined as IL5/IL4/IL13 released from CD4 T cells, was observed to either the Spike (S) or Nucleoprotein (N) in any of the subjects measured, with 0/26 having a twofold increase at day eight post vaccination and with the average percent increase on day eight in response to N was 0.09/0.02/0.04 percent and to S was 0.02/0.09/0.1 for IL5/IL4/IL13 respectively (Figure N5C).
 
    25 

  

The majority of subjects had an increase in Th1 responses, defined as IFNg/TNFa/CD107a, particularly from CD8+ T cells in response to S peptides (Figure N5A-B). In response to S peptides, 13 of 26 (50%) subjects had a twofold or higher increase in Th1 cytokine release, or in the case of CD107a, expression from CD8 T cells and 17 of 26 (65%) had a 1.5-fold or higher increase. 19 of 26 (73%) subjects had any measurable CD8 T cell response above baseline. Average percent increase on d8 above pre-vaccinated baseline was 1.5/4.6/1.95 for IFNg/TNFa/CD107a respectively. Five of 26 (19%) of subjects had CD4 T cells that had a twofold or higher increase, with 14 of 26 (54%) having any measurable CD4 T cell response above baseline. The average percent increase of CD4 T cells was 0.6/1.0/0.9 for IFNg/TNFa/CD107a respectively. In response to N peptides nine of 26 (35%) had a twofold or higher increase of Th1 responses from CD8 T cells over pre-vaccinated baseline, with 11 of 26 (42%) having a measurable CD8 T cell response. Only one of 26 had a Th1 CD4 T cell response to N that was twofold or higher, with nine of 26 (35%) having some measurable CD4 T cell response to N. The average % increase in CD8 was 0.1/0.2/0.6 and in CD4 was 0.08/0.08/0.2 for IFNg/TNFa/CD107a respectively. The high magnitude Th1 CD8 T cell response to S without discernible Th2 response suggests that vaccinating subjects with VXA-CoV2-1 increased the protective anti-viral responses without the potential adverse events occurring from Th2 responses.

B cell responses. The major goal of vaccination is to induce an immune response that mediates protection from infection or disease. B lymphocytes, also known as B cells, play an important role towards this goal by producing antibodies that can specifically recognize and inhibit infectious agents. B cells can produce antibodies in different forms, each type with distinct characteristics and roles. B cells with the isotype A (“IgA”) antibodies are the ones preferentially secreted at mucosal surfaces, such as the respiratory tract, where they prevent foreign substances from entering the body. The ability of our candidate vaccine to promote specific B cells capable of making high levels of antibodies (called ‘plasmablasts’) was tested using both flow cytometry-based measurements and an antibody-secreting cell (ASC) assay by ELISPOT. Flow cytometry allows measurement of proteins expressed by the cells, either on the surface or inside the cell. We explored immune cell populations in the peripheral blood. This analysis revealed a significant expansion in the overall plasmablast population eight days after vaccination (p<0.0001, Wilcoxon test) with 69% of vaccinees in this study showing a twofold or higher increase in the frequencies of these antibody-secreting cells when compared to baseline levels (Figures N6A-B). Further investigation indicated upregulation of both IgA and the mucosal homing receptor b7 on the surface of circulating plasmablasts post vaccination, particularly in the higher dose cohort (p=0.0261, Mann-Whitney test), thus suggesting vaccine-induced migration of this IgA-producing B cell population to mucosal tissues (Figure N6C). Contextually, the ELISPOT assay also confirmed a strong production of IgA-secreting ASC on day 8 after vaccination (fourfold median increase over day 1 levels), additionally highlighting the ability for these cells to recognize and bind the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Figure N6D).

Antibody Responses.  Serum samples were measured for neutralizing antibodies. No neutralizing antibodies were found in the serum at day 29 (and day 56 for the five subjects given two low doses). Increases in IgG responses were measured in the serum of only a few subjects. Local immune responses at the site of infection are of particular interest due to their ability to block viral entry, and IgA is considered to be the first line of defense at most mucosal tissues. To measure the immune response in the mucosa, nasal and saliva samples were taken. Sera samples were taken as well, as serum can also contain IgA. Levels of IgA antibodies were measured using a multiplex assay on the Meso Scale Discovery platform that measures antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 S protein, N protein and the Spike Receptor Binding Domain (“RBD”). This platform allows capture of antibodies specific for multiple antigens at once using a lower sample volume than a traditional ELISA format. In a preliminary analysis, a twofold or more increase above pre-vaccination samples in SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA found in the various compartments was detected in 18 of 35 subjects (52%) 29 days post vaccination. 11 of 35 (32%) had a twofold or above response to S protein, 13 of 35 (37%) had a twofold or above response to N protein, 16 of 35 (46%) had a twofold or above response to RBD, with 14 of 35 (40%) having a twofold or above response to two or more antigens. In Cohort 1, where subjects had two doses, four of five (80%) had SARS-CoV-2 IgA responses twofold or above and five of five (100%) had responses 1.5-fold or above in one or more compartments. These results include all subjects. Because samples that may lack any IgA in them are unlikely to show specific antibody responses, future work will normalize samples by the total amount of IgA and discard samples without any IgA from the analysis.

MesoScale Discovery (MSD) SARS-CoV-2 V-plex plates were used to measure spike (S), nucleoprotein (N) and receptor binding domain (RBD) in serum, nasal and saliva samples. Sera was measured at a dilution of 1:100, nasal and saliva samples measured at a dilution of 1:10. Fold rise was calculated by the division of day 8 over day 1 (baseline) MSD arbitrary units.
Phase 2a Study VXA-COV2-201:  Part 1 - Dose Optimization in Adults
 
We initiated dosing in Part 1 of a Phase 2a study in the October 2021 utilizing an open-label, dose-ranging design (Part 1) to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of VXA-CoV2-1.1-S administered orally to healthy adult volunteers. We initiated dosing with this candidate in a two-part Phase 2 clinical study in October 2021, with approximately 896 participants planned for enrollment utilizing a two-part study design. The first part of the study (“Part 1”) planned enrollment of 48 participants aged 18 to 55 and 48 participants aged 56 to 75, in order to further evaluate safety and immunogenicity and to assess optimal dosage. Further, half the subjects in the trial would be prior vaccinated (have received two doses of an mRNA vaccine) to test the ability of the Vaxart COVID-19 vaccine candidate to boost immune responses and enhance variant-specific cross-reactivity, and half the subjects would be naïve to prior vaccinations. Upon dose selection from Part 1, the second part of the study (“Part 2”) planned enrollment of approximately 800 subjects aged 18 to 75. Part 2 is designed to test preliminary vaccine efficacy to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The active period of first part of the study (“Part 1”) followed subjects through 4 weeks post last dose and has been completed. The 12 month safety follow-up period is ongoing. The actual enrollment of participants for Part 1 was less than planned due to the inability to identify vaccine-naïve individuals (Table N1). Further, because of small group sizes and enrollment during substantial SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks at the study sites, fewer subjects were available for analysis, so the low and high dose groups were combined in most of the analysis. Top-line data from this portion of the trial was announced in September 2022, indicating that the primary and secondary endpoints were both met. Due to the pandemic and the emergence of new COVID-19 strains, Vaxart is not proceeding with Part 2.

Safety Results
 
VXA-COV2-201 – Sixty-five of 66 enrolled subjects received both vaccine doses (Day 1 and Day 29).  One subject tested positive for pregnancy prior to dose 2 and was not given dose 2. She underwent an elective termination of pregnancy and has continued in the safety follow-up period.  One subject withdrew consent after dose 2. Solicited AEs were reported by 52% of study participants (34 out of 66 subjects). The most commonly reported solicited AEs were headache, malaise, fatigue, and myalgia. All reported solicited symptoms were mild to moderate in severity. There were no severe solicited AEs and no subjects discontinued due to a solicited adverse event (AE).
 


Fourteen of 66 subjects (21%) experienced unsolicited AEs during the active period of the study (through Day 57). Four subjects experienced 6 unsolicited AEs that were considered possibly or probably related to study treatment: one subject had mild dizziness on Day 2, one subject had mild increased thirst after both doses and mild dizziness on Day 1, one subject experienced asymptomatic hyponatremia and one subject reported moderate epigastric pain on Days 2-3 after dose 2. All related unsolicited AEs were mild or moderate in severity and resolved without the need for medical treatment. There was one unrelated SAE and no Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) reported during the active period. The 12-month safety follow-up period, following subjects for SAEs, AESI and Medically Attended Adverse Events (MAAEs), is ongoing with expected completion in the second quarter of 2023. 
 
Because most people have already received an mRNA vaccine, Vaxart’s ability to boost the antibody responses following mRNA vaccination was particularly relevant.  Vaxart’s oral vaccine candidate was able to boost the serum antibody responses for volunteers that previously received two mRNA vaccine (either Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna) 6 months or more prior to tablet immunization. After removing known infected subjects from the analysis and combining the high and low dose groups in the 18-55 age cohorts, serum neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan), a recognized correlate of protection, were boosted in this population from a geometric mean of 481 to 778 AU/ml, a fold rise of 1.6. A test of sera from unvaccinated convalescent subjects taken in 2021 and likely infected with Wuhan virus, demonstrated a geometric mean titer of 84.  This shows that mRNA vaccination substantially improved the neutralizing antibody titers compared to infection and that the Vaxart oral tablets were able to boost these titers even further.  Given that subjects with lower titers are more susceptible to infection, the data was divided into those with titers above 200 versus subjects below 200; the 200 AU/ml cutoff is approximately 2 fold higher than the convalescent geometric mean.  Those subjects with starting nAb titers less than 200 had a 2.5 Geometric fold increase, changing the population from 50% less than 200 AU/ml cutoff to 80% post oral tablet administration (Figure N8). These titers were against the original Wuhan strain.  There were also substantial increases in the neutralizing antibody responses to the more recently circulation strain of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA4/5 in these volunteers as measured by sVNT assay (Figure N9). Percent inhibition for individual subjects was plotted from lowest starting percent inhibition to highest inhibition (left to right).  According to Lim, et al, 68% inhibition correlated to protection.  By this analysis, 35% were “seroprotected” pre oral vaccination and 70% were “seroprotected” post immunization.  Increases in the mucosal IgA antibody responses (antibodies in the nose and mouth) were observed in approximately 50% of subjects.  Subjects that had an increase in the mucosal IgA response to SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan S had an increase in IgA responses to other coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA4/5 and SARS-CoV-1, demonstrating the cross-reactive nature of these immune readouts (Figure N10). 
 
Figure N8.  Neutralizing antibody responses to Wuhan following oral immunization
 

Figure N8.  Neutralizing antibody responses were measured using a qualified pseudovirus assay for subjects that previously received an mRNA vaccine.  Titers were measured before oral immunization (day 1) and post oral immunization (day 57).  The geometric mean titers increased in the subjects with titers less than 200 AU/ml, but not in subjects with higher starting titers.

Figure N9.  Neutralizing antibody responses were measured on days 1 and 57 to omicron BA4/5 for individual subjects boosted with the Vaxart oral tablet vaccine.  Neutralizing antibody responses were measured by surrogate neutralizing antibody assay (sVNT). Per the method described by Lim and colleagues (Lim, et al, Vaccines, 2021) a seroprotected threshold was set at 68% inhibition.  Using this threshold, 35% of subjects were “seroprotected” at day 1 and 70% reached “seroprotection” by day 57.

Figure N10.  Individual subject mucosal immune responses to the S protein were plotted against the various SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as MERS and SARS-CoV-1. Open circles represent nasal IgA responses, and closed circles represent saliva IgA responses.  50% of subjects had a 1.5x or greater response to Wuhan and 55% of subjects had a response to Omicron BA 4/5. 
 
Next steps
 
Given the speed at which new strains are emerging, and the substantially cross-reactive mucosal immune responses we have seen using our platform, Vaxart has initiated preclinical work on novel vaccine constructs that seek to create a potent pan-betacoronavirus vaccine candidate that would respond to SARS-CoV-2 and also other betacoronaviruses (such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV).  If successful, this would negate strain changes every year. 
 
In June 2022, we announced a partnership with hVivo Services Limited (“hVIVO”) to test a Vaxart COVID-19 vaccine candidate for efficacy in a SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study. In the first quarter of 2023, we decided to postpone initiating the SARS-CoV-2 human challenge study. As we advance new vaccine candidates, we will determine the best development plan, which may include a human challenge study.

Our Seasonal Influenza Program
 
Market Overview
 
Influenza is one of the most common global infectious diseases, causing mild to life-threatening illness with symptoms such as sore throat, nasal discharge, fever, and even death. It is estimated that at least 350 million cases of seasonal influenza occur annually worldwide, of which 3 million to 5 million cases are considered severe, causing 290,000 to 650,000 deaths per year globally. Very young children and the elderly are at greatest risk from death. In the United States, between 5% and 20% of the population contracts influenza, between 140,000 and 710,000 people are hospitalized with complications of influenza, and between 12,000 and 52,000 people die from influenza and its complications each year, with up to 90% of influenza-related deaths occurring in adults older than 65. The total economic burden of seasonal influenza has been estimated to be $87.1 billion, including medical costs which average $10.4 billion annually, while lost earnings due to illness and loss of life amount to $16.3 billion annually.
 
The CDC generally recommends that individuals 6 months and older be vaccinated annually against influenza. In the U.S., this means an influenza vaccination is recommended for more than 300 million people. During the 2021/2022 influenza season, approximately 175 million doses of the influenza vaccine were delivered in the United States. Differentiated flu vaccines in the U.S. market continue to demonstrate the ability to ask for premium prices based on the additional value they provide to public health. We believe, worldwide, the primary drivers of market growth include increasing awareness, increasing vaccination coverage in emerging countries, rising government support for immunization against seasonal influenza, pricing increases due to product differentiation and increased focus on the production and advancement of vaccination treatments.
 
Limitations of Current Seasonal Influenza Vaccines
 
Despite the number of cases of influenza diagnosed in the United States, according to the CDC, in the 2021/2022 seasonal influenza season, only approximately 51% of the total U.S. population was vaccinated against influenza, with particularly low vaccination rates among adults between ages 18 and 49. We believe the low vaccination rates among this population are largely attributed to the following limitations of injectable vaccine administration:
Limitations for Providers
 

● | longer manufacturing, shipping and handling time for suppliers;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | cold storage requirement throughout the logistics chain;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | the need for healthcare professional oversight during and after the vaccination procedure;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potential for needle injuries; and
--+-----------------------------------


● | medical waste.
--+---------------

Limitations for Users
 

● | inconvenience and time commitment required to obtain vaccine at a clinic or pharmacy;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fear of needles;
--+-----------------


● | pain at injection site; and
--+----------------------------


● | potential for allergic reactions to the egg component of the vaccine.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Candidate
 
We are developing a tablet vaccine candidate for the immunization of healthy adults against seasonal influenza. Commercial seasonal influenza vaccines today are composed of either three (trivalent) or four (quadrivalent) strains, either one influenza B and two influenza A strains, or two of each. Our seasonal influenza vaccine candidate is being designed to cover the four-strain, or quadrivalent, seasonal influenza vaccine consisting of two circulating influenza A lineage viruses (H1N1 and H3N2) as well as two circulating influenza B lineage viruses, matching the seasonally updated recommendations by the FDA. We envision formulating our tablet vaccine candidate as one tablet per strain, or four tablets in total for the quadrivalent vaccine. We believe this modularity will allow for enhanced flexibility. For instance, in the event of a late season strain change, the tablet containing the obsolete strain could be easily replaced without having to discard the three correctly matched vaccine tablets. Alternatively, we have the option to formulate all four strains into a single tablet. This format would be the simplest to administer, but would take away some of the flexibility advantages that separate tablets would afford. We will assess the final formulation of our tablet vaccine candidates after conducting market studies to evaluate market acceptance closer to commercialization.
 
We believe our tablet vaccine candidates have the potential to address many of the limitations of current injectable, egg-based seasonal influenza vaccines. First, our tablet vaccine candidates are designed to create broad and durable immune responses, which may provide more effective immunity and protect against additional strain variants. Second, by providing a more convenient method of administration to enhance patient acceptance and simplify distribution and administration. Finally, by using recombinant methods, we believe our tablet vaccine candidates may be manufactured more rapidly than vaccines manufactured using egg-based methods, eliminate the risk of allergic reactions to egg protein, and alleviate issues caused by egg-adaptation of a mammalian virus.

Seasonal Influenza Clinical Trials
 
To date, we have completed two Phase 1 trials and have conducted the active portion of a Phase 2 challenge trial of our H1N1 influenza vaccine candidate. We have also completed a Phase 1 trial of an influenza B vaccine candidate.  Thus, we have clinical results on two of the minimum three strains needed for a seasonal influenza vaccine.
Phase 1 Trial, VXA02-001, H1N1 Influenza Vaccine Candidate, 109 and 1010 IU Doses
 
The first Phase 1 H1N1 trial was conducted at doses of 1 x 109 and 1 x 1010 IU. Two doses were given one month apart. The tablet vaccine candidate generated a favorable safety and tolerability profile. The trial also demonstrated robust T cell responses and modest hemagglutination inhibition assay (“HAI”) responses, each dependent on the dosage level.
Phase 1 Trial VXA02-003, H1N1 Influenza Vaccine Candidate, 1011 IU Dose
 
The second H1N1 trial was a tablet vaccine trial at a dose of 1 x 1011 IU, delivered in a single administration. We observed a favorable safety and tolerability profile at this dose level. An HAI seroconversion rate of 75% was measured in the vaccine group, compared to 0% in the placebo group. 92% of subjects had a four-fold increase in Micro Neutralization (“MN”) titer after the single administration of tablets. Both the HAI seroconversion rate and the MN responses were substantially higher than the respective rates that we observed at lower doses in Trial VXA02-001. The side effects of the vaccine or placebo in the first seven days following administration were mild with no serious adverse effects. In the first seven days following administration, there were eight total solicited AEs reported in the vaccine and placebo groups (four in each group). All these AEs were grade 1 in severity. The most frequent AE was headache (two in placebo, and one in the vaccine group). There were no SAEs and no new onsets of chronic illnesses related to the adjuvant recorded during the entire one year follow up period of the study.
 
The table below summarizes the trial design and results (serum antibody responses) of our two placebo-controlled Phase 1 H1N1 clinical trials.
 
Table 7. Overview: H1 Influenza Phase 1 Placebo-Controlled Studies.
 

TRIAL NO./ # SUBJECTS | TRIAL DESIGN | STUDY GROUPS DOSE/SCHEDULE | KEY IMMUNOGENICITY FINDINGS 
-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 1 Trial VXA02-001 N = 36 | Dose-escalation, placebo-controlled, double-blind with enteric-coated capsules | 109, 1010 IU of VXA-A1.1 (H1) vaccine or placebo on Day 0 and Day 28, administered in tablet form | 109 dose level: • No HAI seroconversion 1010 dose level: • 27% HAI seroconversion • 64% MN (4X rise) 
Phase 1 Trial VXA02-003 N = 24 | Placebo-controlled, double-blind, with enteric-coated tablets | 1011 IU VXA-A1.1 (H1) vaccine or placebo on Day 0, single administration in table form | • 75% HAI seroconversion • 92% MN (4X rise) 

Phase 1 Trial. Influenza B
 
In 2015 and 2016, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 trial to test the safety and immunogenicity of an influenza B tablet vaccine. A total of 54 healthy adults aged 18 to 49 were enrolled, with 38 receiving the vaccine and 16 receiving placebo. To participate in this trial, subjects were required to have an initial HAI measure of no greater than 1:20. The active phase of the trial was through day 28, with the follow-up phase for monitoring safety to continue for one year. All subjects who received the vaccine received a single dose of either 1 x 1010 IU or 1 x 1011 IU on Day 0.
 
Safety. The side effects of the vaccine or placebo in the first seven days following administration were generally mild with no serious adverse events. There were no notable differences between the active dose groups and placebo in safety and tolerability.
 
HAI. In the placebo group, HAI GMT remained essentially unchanged (1:33) at day 28 post dosing. The GMFR of HAI titers both active treated groups at day 28 post dosing was about 2-fold, and independent of dose. For the vaccinated groups receiving either 1×1010 IU or 1×1011 IU, seroconversion was observed in 5/19 subjects (26.3%) and 3/19 subjects (15.8%), respectively. There were no seroconversions in the placebo group.
 
Antibody Secreting Cells (ASCs). In order to measure total antibody responses to HA, the numbers of circulating B cells that recognize influenza HA in peripheral blood were measured by ASC assay on days 0 and 7 after immunization. Results show that ASCs could be reliably measured on day 7 in the vaccine-treated groups. Background ASCs were generally negligible on day 0. By IgG ASC, 68% of 1×1010 IU dose subjects responded, and 84% of subjects in the 1×1011 IU dose group responded. For the 1×1011 IU dose vaccine treated group, an average of 21 IgA ASCs (95% CI: 7 – 35) and 73 IgG ASCs (95% CI: 35 – 111) each per 1×106 peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) were found at day 7. For the 1×1010 IU dose vaccine treated group, an average of 16 IgA ASCs (95% CI: 2 – 29) and 44 IgG ASCs (95% CI: 21 – 66) were found at day 7. The placebo group had no responders, and negligible average number of spots (1 or less) on Day 7 (95% CI: -0.6 – -2).
 
H1N1 Influenza Phase 2 Challenge Study Funded by HHS BARDA
 
In 2015, we were awarded a $13.9 million contract by BARDA, part of the HHS. This two-year contract was awarded under a Broad Agency Announcement issued to support the advanced development of more effective influenza vaccines to improve seasonal and pandemic influenza preparedness. The contract primarily funded a Phase 2 challenge study in human volunteers, designed to evaluate whether our H1N1 tablet vaccine candidate offers broader and more durable protection than currently marketed injectable vaccines. The contract with HHS BARDA was subsequently increased to $15.7 million and the term was extended until September 2018.
 
In this Phase 2 study, volunteers were randomized into three groups. One group received our oral H1N1 influenza tablet vaccine candidate, a second group received a commercially licensed inactivated influenza vaccine by intramuscular injection, and a third group received placebo. Three months following immunization, volunteers were challenged (deliberate experimental administration) with live H1N1 (A/H1N1 pdm09) influenza virus by intranasal administration. The placebo group served as the control group to determine how many unvaccinated volunteers became infected and how severe their influenza symptoms became. Data from our vaccine candidate group and the commercially licensed inactivated vaccine group were compared to placebo to determine each vaccine’s efficacy in this challenge study. Importantly, the two vaccines were also compared head-to-head. The goal of the study was to compare the efficacy of our vaccine to protect volunteers from illness caused by H1N1 influenza challenge, compared to both the injectable vaccine and placebo three months after immunization.

Clinical Trial Results VXA-CHAL-201
 
The Phase 2 challenge study was enrolled during 2016 and 2017. During this time, 179 subjects that cleared the screening requirements were randomized to receive a single dose of our tablet vaccine, the commercial injectable vaccine, or placebo. Of these 179 subjects, 143 subjects were subsequently challenged with live H1N1 influenza virus 90 to 120 days after dosing.

● | Safety. The side effects of the vaccines and placebo in the first seven days following administration were generally mild. In the first seven days following administration, the solicited adverse events reported in the vaccine and placebo groups were mostly grade 1 in severity, and none were above grade 2. The most frequent solicited adverse event was headache in our tablet vaccine group (7%), injection site tenderness in the commercially licensed inactivated vaccine group (26%) and headache in the placebo group (19%). There were no serious adverse events and no new onsets of chronic illnesses related to our vaccine adjuvant recorded during the follow up period of the study. The graphs below show the distribution and severity over time of local and systemic (Figures 15 and 16) solicited adverse events.

Efficacy – Reduction of PCR Confirmed Influenza Illness. 
 
The primary efficacy objective was to determine vaccine efficacy of our tablet vaccine following the challenge with the wild-type influenza A H1 virus strain (A/H1N1 pdm09). The primary efficacy endpoint was illness. The illness rate was 29% for our tablet vaccine, 35% for the commercial inactivated influenza vaccine, and 48% for subjects in the placebo group. Our tablet vaccine had a lower rate of illness than the commercial vaccine (-6% difference in illness rate in favor of our vaccine), although given the small size of the study, these differences were not statistically significant. Similarly, the difference in illness rates between our tablet vaccine and placebo (-19.1%) and the commercial injected vaccine and placebo (-13.2%) trended toward protection but were not statistically significant. These results suggest that our vaccine is no worse, and trended better than the commercial vaccine for protection. These results are summarized in the table below.

Table 8. H1 Influenza Phase 2 Challenge Study: Illness Rates*.
 

VAXART | Commercial | VAXART-Commercial | Placebo 
-------+-------------------+-------------------+------------------
n | % (95% CI) | n | % (95% CI) | Rate Difference (95% CI) | n | % (95% CI) 
58 | 29.3 (18.1, 42.7) | 54 | 35.2 (22.7, 49.4) | -5.9 (-24.3, 12.5) | 31 | 48.4 (30.2, 66.9)

 
*Illness was defined as a combination of symptoms reported on a patient reported outcome tool (Flu-PROTM) and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) detectable shed influenza virus.
 
Efficacy – Flu-PRO symptom Scores
 
There were no statistically significant differences between the commercial inactivated influenza vaccine and our tablet vaccine for the Flu-PRO questionnaire, a validated patient recorded outcome tool used in influenza clinical trials in the community. However, our vaccine trended lower for overall symptom severity. Subjects in the VXA-A1.1 group showed a lower overall median Flu-PRO score (2.0 [0, 72]) than the QIV group (5.0 [0, 59]) or the placebo group (5.0 [0, 52]).
 
Efficacy – Shedding
 
Shedding represents influenza virus that is detected in nasal swabs post infection and is representative of viral infection and replication. In the study, 44.8% of subjects in VXA-A1.1 had at least one day positive for shedding, versus the commercial injected vaccine where 53.7% were positive for shedding and where 71.0% of placebo subjects were positive for shedding. There were no statistically significant differences observed between our tablet vaccine and the commercial inactivated influenza vaccine for viral shedding area under the curve (“AUC”). However, AUC was calculated using a standard logarithmic trapezoidal method and included only detectable shedding during the first five days of the duration of shedding, with subjects removed from the analysis that didn’t shed influenza for 5 days (a zero value cannot be used in log calculations and integrated). This may have led to an underestimate of the effect on viral shedding for the two vaccines relative to placebo. Therefore, in order to better determine the effect of the vaccines on shedding, an alternative method was used in which volunteers were defined as infected if they had detectable viral shedding at any time 36 hours after challenge. This approach eliminated possible issues related to calculations (log calculations of zero values) and of large doses of challenge virus (first 36 hours might be pass through rather than replicating influenza). In a Bayesian analysis, both vaccines significantly reduced the probability of shedding relative to placebo (Bayesian posterior p=0.001 for our tablet vaccine and p=0.009 for the commercial inactivated influenza vaccine). There is also trend toward greater efficacy for our vaccine with a posterior probability of approximately 80% (Table 9).
 
Table 9. H1 Influenza Phase 2 Challenge Study: Infection Rates*.
 

Treatment Arm | N | Number Infected | Percent (95% CI) | Posterior P
---------------+----+-----------------+------------------+------------
Placebo | 31 | 22 | 71% (55-85%) | - 
Commercial | 54 | 24 | 44% (32-58%) | 0.009 
Vaxart Vaccine | 58 | 21 | 36% (24-49%) | 0.001 

 
*Infection was defined as any positive quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) detectable shed influenza virus on any day after 36 hours from viral challenge. In a Bayesian analysis, both vaccines provide a statistically significant protection against infection. There is also trend toward greater efficacy for our vaccine with a posterior probability of approximately 80%.
 
Immunogenicity
 
HAI responses. HAI measures the ability of serum antibodies that can disrupt binding of influenza virus to red blood cells. Historically, HAI correlates to protection for injected influenza vaccines. HAI responses were measured 30 days following immunization to determine the number and percentage of volunteers that seroconverted. In our tablet vaccine group, 32% of volunteers achieved seroconversion. In the commercial inactivated influenza vaccine group 84% of volunteers achieved HAI seroconversion at 30 days post vaccination. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001, Fisher’s Exact test). There were no subjects in the placebo group who achieved seroconversion at 30 days post vaccination. Since 32% of subjects seroconverted in the Vaxart tablet vaccine group achieved HAI seroconversion, but 71% of subjects were protected from illness following influenza challenge, HAI seroconversion appeared not to be a reliable indicator of protection for the Vaxart vaccine. The table below summarizes the HAI data. The GMT, GMFR, percentage of volunteers who had a fourfold rise in their HAI and the percentage of subjects who seroconverted are reported.

IgA Antibody Secreting Cells. B cells specific for influenza HA (IgA antibody secreting cells or IgA ASCs) were measured at baseline and eight days following immunization in order to determine the B cell responses to the vaccines. At eight days following vaccination, subjects in the commercial inactivated influenza vaccine group had significantly higher mean numbers of spots per 106 cells (p<0.001, Wilcoxon test) and significantly higher percentages of subjects with greater than 8 spots per 106 cells (p<0.001, Fisher exact). At Day 8, the commercial inactivated influenza vaccine group had mean spots 286 per 106 cells compared to mean spots of 116 per 106 cells for the Vaxart tablet vaccine. Additionally, the commercial inactivated influenza vaccine group had a 96% response rate compared to 71% in the Vaxart tablet vaccine group. The table below summarizes these data.

Correlation of IgA ASCs with Illness for the Vaxart Tablet Vaccine. As stated above, the absolute mean number of ASCs was higher for the commercial inactivated influenza vaccine group (286 spots per 106 cells) than for the Vaxart tablet vaccine (116 spots per 106 cells). However, when a comparison was made between the two vaccines of the ratio of IgA ASCs in volunteers that were not ill divided by volunteers that were ill following challenge, the Vaxart tablet vaccine group had a ratio of 4.7, compared to a ratio of 1.4 for the commercial injected vaccine. In a logistics fit model with illness compared to non-illness as the outcome, and IgA ASC as the independent variable, the model showed that the Vaxart tablet vaccine IgA ASC could predict ill versus non-ill, but the logistics fit model for the commercial inactivated influenza vaccine could not (p=0.0005 for our vaccine, p=0.3066 for the commercial injected vaccine for whole logistic model). These data suggest that IgA ASC is important for protection against influenza for our oral vaccine, but not for injected commercial vaccines. These data also suggest that there are qualitative differences between B cells induced post immunization by different methods. We are actively exploring these qualitative differences.

Preclinical Results
 
We have completed several animal challenge studies for influenza. In an H1N1 influenza challenge study, mice immunized orally with our tablet vaccine candidate were protected against sickness and death compared to unimmunized, control animals. Similarly, our oral H5N1 vaccine candidate protected ferrets and mice against a lethal avian influenza challenge compared to unimmunized animals when the vaccine construct expressed an avian influenza HA construct.
Cross Protection of Vaxart Quadrivalent Seasonal Flu Vaccine against Avian Flu in Ferret Challenge Model
 
A more recent ferret challenge experiment was completed in 2017 to compare an oral quadrivalent vaccine that we designed with the commercial vaccine Fluzone for protection against a virulent avian influenza strain. There are no components of seasonal influenza vaccines that are matched to the HA made by avian influenza virus, so the virus represents a severe case of vaccine mismatched to virus. Our quadrivalent vaccine was made by mixing four recombinant adenoviruses, each expressing a different HA that matches the HAs in the commercial vaccine, not the HA of the challenge. Two different doses were evaluated; the high dose was used at 1:10 of a Vaxart human dose (Vaxart Quad) and the low dose (Vaxart Quad Low) was used at 1:100 of the human dose. The Fluzone group (QIV) was given at 1:10 of the human dose to directly compare to the Vaxart quadrivalent high dose group. Vaxart animals and the negative control (PBS) animals were given vaccine delivered by endoscope. The QIV animals were intramuscularly injected. Animals were vaccinated on days 0 and 28. Animals were challenged on day 56 with approximately 102.69 TCID50/mL of wild type A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (A/VN). Results show that the Vaxart quadrivalent vaccines were able to protect against mismatched A/VN, trending better than Fluzone. The high dose group was able to protect all ferrets against death whereas the low dose Vaxart group protected 75% of ferrets.

Our HPV Therapeutic Vaccine Candidate 
 
In previous clinical studies with our H5 influenza vaccine candidate, we observed robust T-cell responses that appeared to compare favorably with published results of other flu vaccines, including an adjuvanted vaccine as well as an attenuated live viral vaccine. Specifically, our vaccine candidate generated high levels of polyfunctional cytotoxic CD4 and CD8 cells, T-cells that are likely required to obtain a therapeutic benefit in chronic viral infection and cancer. It was based on these observations that we embarked on the development of our first therapeutic vaccine candidate, targeting HPV-associated dysplasia and cervical cancer.
Medical Need, Commercial Opportunity
 
HPV is a family of more than 120 viruses which are extremely common globally. At least 13 HPV types are cancer-causing. HPV is primarily transmitted through sexual contact and infection is very prevalent following the onset of sexual activity. Nearly all cases of cervical cancer are attributable to HPV infection, with two HPV types – HPV-16 and HPV-18 – responsible for 70% of cervical cancers and precancerous cervical lesions. Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide, and about 13,000 new cases are diagnosed annually in the United States according to the National Cervical Cancer Coalition. Studies have indicated a high lifetime probability of any HPV infection by both men and women in the United States, with some estimates indicating at least 80% of women and men acquire HPV by age 45. The CDC estimates 80 million U.S. citizens are currently infected with HPV, representing 25% of the population, with about 14 million new infections per year. 
 
In women, many HPV infections of the cervix will spontaneously resolve and clear within two to three years, but women who have a persistent infection are at high risk of developing cellular abnormalities known as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, or CIN, which can progress to invasive cancer over time. More than 400,000 women are diagnosed with CIN annually in the United States, with an annual incidence estimate for CIN1 and CIN2/3 at 1.6 and 1.2 per 1,000 women, respectively.
 
There are currently no approved therapeutic vaccines to treat HPV infection or cancer. Current treatment options for women infected with HPV (see below) include monitoring CIN status, surgical procedures to remove affected tissue, and chemotherapeutic or radiation therapies to treat localized or metastatic cervical cancer. Therefore, a medical need remains for a therapeutic vaccine to treat women with HPV-associated CIN and/or cervical cancer.

Our HPV Therapeutic Vaccine Candidate
 
We are in the early stages of developing a bivalent HPV vaccine against HPV-16 and HPV-18, the strains responsible for approximately 70% of cases of cervical cancer. We plan to target the E6 and E7 gene products of each strain, which are the primary oncogenic proteins responsible for progression through the stages of CIN to invasive cervical cancer. In pre-clinical studies, we have demonstrated immunogenicity for both our HPV-16 and our HPV-18 vaccine candidates. Specifically, mice given our HPV-16 or HPV-18 vaccines induced T cell responses to HPV as measured by IFN gamma ELISPOT. In addition, our HPV-16 vaccine has demonstrated tumor growth suppression as well as increased survival in a robust HPV tumor model in mice. We believe that our HPV vaccine has several advantages over current treatment options for both CIN and cervical cancer. Current treatment options for CIN are invasive and can lead to serious contraindications for pregnancy. In addition, surgical treatments for CIN do not treat the underlying HPV, but rather remove infected tissue. As a result, current CIN treatment options have a significant failure rate which can increase the risk for progression to cervical cancer. Our vaccines have demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile in clinical subjects dosed to date. Current treatment options for cervical cancer, such as chemotherapy and radiation treatment, have multiple side effects such as hair loss, loss of appetite, and severe nausea.
T cells Responses to HPV-16 Can Shrink Solid Tumors Derived from Transformed HPV
 
The ability of T cell responses to HPV-16 to produce a therapeutic response was tested in a solid tumor growth model. TC-1 cells (an HPV-16 transformed cell-line) were injected subcutaneously into the hind flank of B6 mice and allowed to grow for several days before mice were immunized with vaccine or controls. In study 1, mice were immunized on days 7, 14, and 21. For groups 4 and 5, the vaccine expressed the HPV-16 antigens E6/E7 (Ad-HPV). A checkpoint inhibitor (an antibody to PD-1) was used along with the vaccine in group 5, and an isotype control (Iso) to the checkpoint inhibitor was used in group 4. A recombinant rAd vector identical to Ad-HPV, but which doesn’t express the HPV antigens (Ad-nr), was used in groups 1 or 2 to control for non-specific effects. Untreated animals were not given any vaccine.
 
The results in study 1 showed that Ad-HPV groups were able to the stop tumor growth and even shrink the tumor. This occurred whether the checkpoint inhibitor was used or not. The checkpoint inhibitor alone was not able to stop tumor progression, and eventually all these animals perished. Other control animals without Ad-HPV didn’t survive as well. The use of the checkpoint inhibitor with the Ad-HPV vaccine trended slightly better for survival (10/10 versus 9/10 survived), but this was not significant.
 
In study 2, the TC-1 tumor was transplanted as before, but allowed to grow longer before immunization occurred. Immunizations occurred on days 13, 20, and 27. In this study, mice that received the Ad-HPV vaccine plus the checkpoint inhibitor were able to control the tumor, up through day 40 before a few mice started to perish. More than 70% of animals in this group survived through the end of the experiment on day 80. Ad-HPV immunized mice in the absence of the checkpoint inhibitor were also able to substantially control the tumor through 60 days (33 days after the last immunization), before several additional animals perished. No control groups in the absence of the Ad-HPV were able to control any of the tumors, and all mice perished before day 40.
 
Figure 19.  Small Tumor Vaccine Study.
 


Figure 19.  In the small tumor vaccine study (Study 1), tumors were allowed to grow for seven days before beginning the immunization schedule. Animals given the Vaxart HPV vaccine (Ad-HPV) were protected against tumor growth and survived better. This was the case whether or not a checkpoint inhibitor was used.

Figure 20.  Large Tumor Vaccine Study.
 

Figure 20.  In the large tumor vaccine study (Study 2), tumors were allowed to grow for 13 days before the vaccines were given. Again, animals given the Ad-HPV were better protected against tumor growth. The addition of the checkpoint inhibitor improved survival.
 
The T cells induced post immunization in the tumor model were believed to traffic back to the solid tumor to attack and destroy the cancer cells. This was tested in an additional tumor model experiment. Tumors were transplanted as before, and immunizations were performed on days 13 and 21. Tumors were harvested from the experiment on day 24, and flow cytometry was used to enumerate the T cells infiltrating the tumors. The HPV-16 vaccine groups (with either the checkpoint inhibitor or an isotype control antibody) had T cell infiltrates of both CD4 and CD8 positive T cells. The CD8 T cell numbers from the Ad-HPV groups were significantly better than control treated animals in terms of infiltrating lymphocytes. The CD4 T cells were significantly better in the Ad-HPV + checkpoint group, and trended higher in the Ad-HPV + isotype control group.
 
Figure 21.  The Ad-HPV vaccine induces T cells that migrate to the tumors.
 

Figure 21.  The number of CD4 and CD8 T cells found within the tumor were analyzed by flow cytometry. The Ad-HPV groups were found to elicit T cells that transited to the tumor, with the Ad-HPV plus checkpoint inhibitor creating slightly more T cell transit than the Ad-HPV vaccine alone.

Near Term HPV Vaccine Development Strategy
 
Clinical 
 
We will need to make a regulatory filing to proceed with clinical trials for a HPV vaccine candidate. Our clinical plan is to test the vaccine candidate in subjects with cervical dysplasia related to HPV-16 or HPV-18, and to evaluate the ability of the vaccine candidate to clear HPV infection, reduce the cervical dysplasia score, and induce T cells known to be important in the clearance of HPV. T cells will be measured by flow cytometry as well as by IFN-g ELISPOT. The primary endpoint will be safety and the secondary endpoint will be immunogenicity by examining T cell responses. Although clinical responses will be tracked, it is expected that the first study may not be powered to obtain statistically significant efficacy readouts.
Other Indications
 
We currently have preliminary data in animal models for indications such as RSV, Chikungunya, Hepatitis B and HSV-2.
 
Manufacturing 
 
Manufacturing our oral tablet vaccines consists of two main stages, the production of bulk vaccine (drug substance), and the formulation and tableting thereof (drug product). Drug substance manufacturing consists primarily of the production and purification of the active ingredient. Bulk drug substance is then lyophilized, formulated and subsequently tableted and coated using a proprietary formulation and tableting process that we developed.
Bulk Vaccine Manufacturing (Drug Substance)
 
From inception, we relied on a combination of third-party contract manufacturers and in-house facilities to manufacture clinical cGMP bulk drug substance for our tablet vaccine candidates. Starting in 2017, we invested in developing our own bulk vaccine manufacturing process with the aim to establish a small cGMP bulk manufacturing facility at our corporate headquarters in California for manufacturing cGMP product for our Phase 1 and small Phase 2 trials. We expanded in November 2021 by subleasing another GMP manufacturing facility which we use to perform the same bulk manufacturing processes in-house. In April 2022, we executed agreements with Lyophilization Technology, Inc. for lyophilization of drug substance at a larger scale.
Vaccine Tablet Manufacturing (Drug Product)
 
From inception we contracted with third-party contract manufacturers for the manufacture, labeling, packaging, storage, and distribution of our drug product. In 2016, we established drug product manufacturing capabilities at our corporate headquarters. Our facility is licensed by the State of California Department of Public Health Food and Drug Branch to manufacture drug product for clinical trials. In July 2022, we executed an agreement with Attwill for further drug product manufacturing (tableting and coating) at a larger scale and we have invested in building a new GMP facility in California for tableting, coating and packaging of our vaccine candidates.
 
We have limited experience with process development, and the manufacture, testing, quality release, storage and distribution of drug substance and drug product according to cGMP and regulatory filings. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to the organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. Our facilities, and our third-party manufacturers, are subject to periodic inspections by FDA and local authorities, which include, but are not limited to procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our vaccine candidates to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. If we or our third-part manufacturers fail to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements we and they could be subject to possible legal or regulatory action, including warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. These actions could have a material adverse impact on the availability of our tablet vaccine candidates. Similar to contract manufacturers, we have in the past encountered difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, and if we are not able to produce drug product or drug substance in sufficient quantities our ability to conduct our clinical trials and commercialize our tablet vaccine candidates, if approved, will be impaired.
 
Research and Development
 
In the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with third parties, such as clinical research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories, to conduct our clinical trials and aspects of our research and preclinical testing. These third parties provide project management and monitoring services and regulatory consulting and investigative services.
Competition
 
The pharmaceutical and vaccine industries are characterized by intense competition to develop new technologies and proprietary products. In general, competition among pharmaceutical products is based in part on product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price and patent position.
 
While we believe that our proprietary tablet vaccine candidates provide competitive advantages, we face competition from many different sources, including biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and we may also face competition from academic institutions, government agencies, as well as public and private research institutions. Any products that we may commercialize will have to compete with existing products and therapies as well as new products and therapies that may become available in the future.
 
There are other organizations working to improve existing therapies, vaccines or delivery methods, or to develop new vaccines, therapies or delivery methods for their selected indications. Depending on how successful these efforts are, it is possible they may increase the barriers to adoption and success of our vaccine candidates, if approved.
 
    39 

  

We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new vaccines enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any tablet or other oral delivery vaccine candidates that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, availability of therapeutics, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we can obtain approval for our vaccine candidates, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products.
 
We face competition from smaller companies who, like us, rely on investors to fund research and development and compete for co-development and licensing opportunities from large and established pharmaceutical companies. We may also face significant competition in pursuing partnership opportunities and strategic acquisitions from other companies, financial investors and enterprises whose cost of capital may be lower than ours. Competition for future partnerships or asset acquisition opportunities in our markets is intense and we may be forced to increase the price we pay for such assets.
 
We also depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes and secure sufficient capital resources for the development and commercialization of our products.
 
Norovirus Vaccine Candidate
 
There is currently no approved norovirus vaccine for sale globally. We believe that HilleVax, Inc. is developing a norovirus vaccine (originally developed by Takeda) that would be delivered by injection. Another company developing a norovirus vaccine candidate is Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biopharmaceutical Co. Ltd. There may be other development programs that we are not aware of.
COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate
 
There is significant competition in the COVID-19 vaccine market. Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine and Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine have been approved in the United States and many countries around the world. Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine and AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine have been approved in many countries around the globe and have supplied the majority of the "western doses" to the world. Other vaccine companies that have received approval in countries around the world for their COVID-19 vaccines include Sanofi S.A. and Novavax.
Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Candidate
 
We believe our seasonal influenza vaccine candidate would compete directly with approved vaccines in the market, which include non-recombinant and recombinant products that are administered via injection or intranasally. The major global non-recombinant injectable vaccine competitors include Astellas Pharma Inc., Abbott Laboratories, AstraZeneca UK Limited, Baxter International Inc., Research Foundation for Microbial Diseases of Osaka University, CSL Sequirus, GSK, Sanofi S.A., Pfizer Inc., and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited. Non-recombinant intranasal competition includes MedImmune, Inc., and potentially others. Recombinant injectable competitors include Sanofi and Novavax, Inc. Many other groups are developing new or improved flu vaccine or delivery methods.
HPV Therapeutic Vaccine Candidate
 
There is currently no approved HPV therapeutic vaccine for sale globally; however, a number of vaccine manufacturers, academic institutions and other organizations currently have, or have had, programs to develop such a vaccine. We believe that several companies are in various stages of developing an HPV therapeutic vaccine including Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Inovio”), Advaxis, Genexine, and several others.
Inavir
 
Other anti influenza antivirals are marketed in Japan, including Tamiflu and Relenza. On February 23, 2018, Osaka-based drug maker Shionogi gained marketing approval for Xofluza, a new drug to treat influenza in Japan. The drug was approved for use against type A and B influenza viruses and requires only a single dose regardless of age. Since its launch, Xofluza has gained significant market share from Inavir in Japan, substantially reducing the sales of Inavir in Japan by Daiichi Sankyo. This has had a significant negative impact on the royalty payments we have received from Daiichi Sankyo and may continue to have a significant negative impact on our future royalty revenues.

Intellectual Property
 
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our platform and on know-how, continuing technological innovation to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the vaccine field. In addition, we rely on regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available. We also utilize trademark protection for our company name and expect to do so for products and/or services as they are marketed.
 
Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our tablet vaccine candidates may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. With respect to company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same.
 
We have developed numerous patents and patent applications and own substantial know-how and trade secrets related to our platform and tablet vaccine candidates.
 

● | Vaccine Platform Technology. As of December 31, 2022, we hold three U.S. patents with granted claims relating to our platform technology. Two of these U.S. patents include claims related to our seasonal influenza vaccine candidate. These patents will expire in 2027, or later if patent term extension applies. As of December 31, 2022, we hold more than 50 issued foreign patents and one pending foreign patent application related to our platform technology and/or our vaccine candidates. These patents will expire in 2027, or later if patent term extension applies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Tablet Vaccine Formulation. We own considerable know-how and hold patents in the U.S., E.U., Japan, China, Singapore, Australia, Russia, Israel, South Korea, and South Africa. We also have pending applications in the United States and around the world related to our tablet vaccine formulation technology. Patents issuing from these applications will expire in 2035/2036, or later if patent term extension applies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate. As of December 31, 2022, we have filed provisional applications in the United States relating to our COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Any patents issuing from these applications will expire in 2041, or later if patent term extension applies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Influenza, Norovirus and RSV Vaccine Candidates. As of December 31, 2022, we hold a patent in South Africa, the European Union, and a number of countries therein, and have pending applications in the United States and around the world relating to our norovirus and RSV vaccine candidates. Any patents issuing from these applications will expire in 2036, or later if patent term extension applies. We have been issued 13 foreign patents related to our current H1N1 influenza vaccine candidate. These patents will expire in 2030, or later if patent term extension applies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Relenza. As of December 31, 2022, we no longer own any Relenza patents, the last Japanese patent related to Relenza, which was exclusively licensed to GSK, having expired in July 2019.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Inavir. As of December 31, 2022, we own Japanese patents related to Inavir, which is exclusively licensed to Daiichi Sankyo. The last patent related to Inavir in Japan is set to expire in December 2029, at which time royalty revenue will cease. However, the patent covering the laninamivir octanoate compound expires in 2024, at which time generic competition may enter the market, potentially decreasing or eliminating the royalties received.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition to the above, we have established expertise and development capabilities focused in the areas of preclinical research and development, manufacturing and manufacturing process scale-up, quality control, quality assurance, regulatory affairs and clinical trial design and implementation. We believe that our focus and expertise will help us develop products based on our proprietary intellectual property.
 
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent.
 
The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Moreover, a patent can only be extended once, and thus, if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a new drug application, or NDA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our vaccine candidates and their methods of use.

Trade Secrets
 
We rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these procedures, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
Federal, state and local government authorities in the United States and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biological and pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. Our vaccine candidates must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, even though it may differ in certain respects. The process for obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The rules and regulations that apply to our business are subject to change and it is difficult to foresee whether, how, or when such changes may affect our business.
U.S. Product Development Process
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical and biological products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and implementing regulations. Products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practice (“GCP”), and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for marketing approval that meets applicable requirements to ensure the continued safety, purity, and potency of the product that is the subject of the BLA based on results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced, to assess compliance with cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 
Before testing any biological vaccine candidate, including our tablet vaccine candidates, in humans, the vaccine candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as toxicological and pharmacological studies in animal species, to assess the potential safety and activity of the vaccine candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs for certain animal studies and the Animal Welfare Act, which is enforced by the Department of Agriculture. The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. Any person or entity sponsoring clinical trials in the United States to evaluate a product candidate’s safety and effectiveness must submit to the FDA, prior to commencing such trials, an IND application, which provides a basis for the FDA to conclude that there is an adequate basis for testing the product in humans. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials.

Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials are subject to extensive regulation. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s bioresearch monitoring regulations and regulations composing the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
 
Foreign studies conducted under an IND must meet the same requirements applicable to studies conducted in the United States. However, if a foreign study is not conducted under an IND, the data may still be submitted to the FDA in support of a product application, if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and the FDA is able to validate the data.
 
The sponsor of a clinical trial or the sponsor’s designated responsible party may be required to register certain information about the trial and disclose certain results on government or independent registry websites, such as clinicaltrials.gov.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 

● | Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects and tested for safety and to develop detailed profiles of its pharmacological and pharmacokinetic actions, determine side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, gain early evidence of effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in subjects.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk to benefit profile of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Phase 3 data often form the core basis on which the FDA evaluates a product candidate’s safety and effectiveness when considering the product application.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
 
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects.
 
Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other criteria, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 
After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data, or full or partial waivers. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for biological products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business.
 
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission, and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. FDA performance goals generally provide for action on a BLA within 12 months of submission. That deadline can be extended under certain circumstances, including by the FDA’s requests for additional information. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, potent, and/or effective for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA without a REMS, if required.
 
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.
 
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. The complete response letter may also request additional information, including additional preclinical or clinical data, for the FDA to reconsider the application. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
 
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product.
 
Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers.
 
Obtaining approval can take years, requires substantial resources and depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the targeted disease or condition, the availability of alternative treatments, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials.

Post-Approval Requirements
 
Any products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved uses, known as ‘off-label’ use, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, if the physicians deem to be appropriate in their professional medical judgment, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. If ongoing regulatory requirements are not met, or if safety problems occur after a product reaches market, the FDA may take actions to change the conditions under which the product is marketed, including limiting, suspending or even withdrawing approval.
 
In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the long-term stability of the product. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
 
Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our tablet vaccine candidates under development.
 
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, for instance the Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the physician payment transparency laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and similar state laws, each as amended.
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor, however, does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances.
 
Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”), as discussed below.
 
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 
The federal FCA prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.
 
    45 

  

HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 
Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 
We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
Additionally, the Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act under the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately, and completely the required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on pharmaceutical manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare providers and entities.
 
In order to distribute products commercially, we must also comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 
Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any tablet vaccine candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our tablet vaccine candidates, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our tablet vaccine candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 
The marketability of any tablet vaccine candidates for which it receives regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect the pressure on healthcare pricing will continue to increase. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 
    46 

  

US Healthcare Reform
 
We anticipate that current and future U.S. legislative healthcare reforms may result in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, if covered, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our tablet vaccine candidates. In addition, it is possible that there will be further legislation or regulation that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Foreign Regulation
 
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Information Privacy and Security
 
We are subject to federal and state laws and regulations that regulate the use, security, and disclosure of certain types of personal data. These include the federal regulations promulgated under the authority of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) that require us to provide certain protections to individuals regarding their health information. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations extensively regulate the use and disclosure of protected health information (“PHI”) and require covered entities, which include healthcare providers and health plans, and their business associates to implement and maintain administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the security of such information. Additional security requirements apply to electronic PHI. These regulations also provide individuals with substantive rights with respect to their health information.
 
The HIPAA privacy and security regulations also require us to enter into written agreements with our covered entity customers and our subcontractors, also known as business associates, to whom we disclose PHI. Covered entities may be subject to penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity. Business associates are also directly subject to liability under certain HIPAA privacy and security regulations and may be found liable for the violations of their agents.
 
HIPAA requires covered entities to notify affected individuals of breaches of unsecured PHI without unreasonable delay but no later than 60 days after discovery of the breach. If a business associate is acting as an agent of a covered entity, then the covered entity must provide the required notifications to individuals based on the time when the business associate discovered the breach. Reporting must also be made to the HHS Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”) and, for breaches of unsecured PHI involving more than 500 residents of a state or jurisdiction, to the media. Impermissible uses or disclosures of unsecured PHI are presumed to be breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the PHI has been compromised. Various state laws and regulations may also require us to notify affected individuals and the state regulators in the event of a data breach involving personal information without regard to the probability of the information being compromised. State laws and standard practice often provide for shorter data breach reporting timelines than required by HIPAA.
 
Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may result in criminal penalties and in substantial civil penalties per violation. The civil penalties are adjusted annually based on updates to the consumer price index. OCR is required to perform compliance audits and investigates HIPAA compliance in response to complaints and reports of breaches. In addition to enforcement by OCR, state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages in response to violations of HIPAA privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy of state residents. OCR may resolve HIPAA violations through informal means, such as allowing a covered entity to implement a corrective action plan, but OCR has the discretion to move directly to impose monetary penalties and is required to impose penalties for violations resulting from willful neglect. There can be no assurance that we will not be the subject of an investigation (arising out of a reportable breach incident, audit or otherwise) alleging noncompliance with HIPAA regulations in our maintenance of PHI.
 
The Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTCA”) also empowers the Federal Trade Commission to implement rules and regulations protecting personal information, and to take enforcement action when data practices constitute unfair or deceptive acts or practices.  The FTC regularly takes enforcement action, and has emphasized the protection of medical and other health care information as an enforcement priority.  Following the United Stated Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision and state laws that may criminalize certain health care procedures, types of personal information not traditionally thought of as health-related now may reveal personal information about health care decisions, heightening governmental scrutiny of data privacy practices.
 
In addition to HIPAA and the FTCA, numerous state and federal laws and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, privacy, confidentiality, security, availability, integrity, creation, receipt, transmission, storage, and other processing of medical. health care, employment, consumer, and other personal information. Privacy and data security statutes and regulations vary from state to state, and these laws and regulations in many cases are more restrictive than, and generally are not preempted by, the FTCA and HIPAA and their implementing rules. These laws and regulations regulate how personal information is used, sold, and shared; grant individuals substantive rights regarding their data that data processers are obligated to honor; impose rigorous information security and data breach obligations; and in some instances provide private rights of action to individuals affected by alleged violations of the laws in addition to the costs and liabilities arising from government enforcement.   
 
We also may be subject to international data protection regulations related to the collection, transmission, storage and use of employee data. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective on May 25, 2018, imposes strict compliance obligations on the collection, use, retention, security, processing, transfer and deletion of personal information and creates enhanced rights for individuals, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the information relates in certain circumstances, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors that will have access to personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the European Economic Area, including the United States and the United Kingdom. Entities that fail to comply with the requirements of the GDPR may be subject to very significant penalties, including potential fines of up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of annual global revenue.

Government regulators, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are also increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit other types of personal data. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, and was significantly modified by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which became fully effective on January 1, 2023, applies broadly to information that identifies or is associated with any California household or individual, and requires that we implement several operational changes, including processes to respond to individuals’ requests regarding their personal information. The CPRA also creates a new enforcement agency to enforce the CCPA and CPRA and imposes additional requirements, including privacy risk assessments, audits and vendor contractual requirements for data sharing, license and access arrangements. The CCPA and CPRA provide for civil penalties for violations and allow private rights of action for data breaches. Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut and Utah have also passed comprehensive privacy legislation that take effect during 2023, and several other states, as well as federal lawmakers, have proposed additional consumer privacy legislation. The complex, dynamic legal landscape regarding privacy, data protection and information security creates significant compliance challenges for us, potentially restricts our ability to collect, use and disclose data, and exposes us to additional expense, and, if we cannot comply with applicable laws in a timely manner or at all, adverse publicity, harm to our reputation, and liability.

We also had 13 full-time equivalent contractors as of December 31, 2022. We do not have collective bargaining agreements with our employees and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 
Our human capital resources objectives include identifying, recruiting, training, retaining, and incentivizing our existing and new employees. We maintain an equity incentive plan, the principal purpose of which is to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we began to offer an employee stock purchase plan, the principal purpose of which is to assist employees in acquiring a share ownership interest in Vaxart, and to help such employees provide for their future security and to encourage them to remain in the employment of Vaxart. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make Vaxart a safe and rewarding workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by competitive compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs, and by programs that build connections between our employees.
 
In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken steps to protect the health and safety of our employees by generally adopting a work from home policy in line with directives from the State of California and the applicable local governments, and guidance from the CDC. On-site activities have been restricted to certain essential facility and laboratory support functions and various safety protocols have been implemented.
