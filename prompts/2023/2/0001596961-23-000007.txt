Our Company
RumbleOn is the nation's first, largest, and only publicly-traded, technology-based platform in the powersports industry. Headquartered in the Dallas Metroplex, RumbleOn is revolutionizing the customer experience for outdoor enthusiasts across the country and making powersport vehicles accessible to more people in more places than ever before. We are transforming the powersports customer experience by giving consumers what they want - a wide selection, great value and quality, transparency, and an easy, friction-free transaction. Every element of our business, from inventory procurement to fulfillment to overall ease of transactions, whether online or on-site at one of our 55 retail locations, has been built for a singular purpose – to create a customer experience without peer in the powersports industry.
Although our primary focus is on the customer experience and building market share in the powersports industry, during 2022 we participated in the wholesale automotive industry through our wholly-owned distributors of used automotive inventory, Wholesale, Inc. ("Wholesale Inc") and our exotics retailer AutoSport USA, Inc., which does business under the name Got Speed. In the third quarter of 2022, we announced we would be winding down our wholesale automotive business, which we expect to complete during the first half of 2023. Our logistics services company, Wholesale Express, LLC ("Wholesale Express"), provides freight brokerage services facilitating transportation for dealers and consumers.
Incorporated in Nevada in 2013, we have been building the RumbleOn brand and vision since 2016. Led by our co-founder, chairman, and Chief Executive Officer Marshall Chesrown, we have achieved and built upon key milestones:
•April 2017: launched RumbleOn.com.
•October 2017: celebrated our initial listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market.
•October 2018: acquired Wholesale Inc and Wholesale Express.
•August 2021: acquired the RideNow companies (the “RideNow Transaction”), a collection of 41 retail powersports locations with a geographic footprint spanning primarily the Sunbelt.
•September 2021: processed the first powersports vehicle through our Orlando Fulfillment Center.
•February 2022: completed the initial funding of our captive consumer finance facility, RumbleOn Finance.
•February 2022: acquired Freedom Powersports (the “Freedom Transaction”), adding ten retail locations in North Texas, one in Alabama, and two in Georgia.
•February 2022: unveiled the regional management structure, anchored by tenured team members of RideNow.
•September 2022: opened our Fulfillment Center in Concord, North Carolina.
•November 2022: acquired Powersports Honda franchise in North Texas.
•December 2022: acquired two full line Polaris franchises in North Texas.
•January 2023: opened our Fulfillment Center in Las Vegas, Nevada.
•February 2023: acquired Red Hills powersports, a single retail location representing 10 brands, in Tallahassee, Florida.
•March 2023: entered into an engagement letter with J.P. Morgan to review our balance sheet initiatives and options.
These key events well-position RumbleOn as the first mover in transforming the powersports industry through our customer experience focused, technology based, Omnichannel platform. 
Our Industry and Opportunity
We operate primarily in the powersports industry, offering significant scale and breadth of products and our platform from which we will provide our only of its kind powersports customer experience. From our view, powersports includes motorcycles, side-by-sides, ATV, UTV, snowmobile, and personal watercraft ("PWC") along with related parts and components. If you add in the largely unaccounted for but significant peer-to-peer market in used powersports, which RumbleOn believes represents up to 70% of used powersports transactions, the total addressable powersports market is likely in excess of $100 billion.
The powersports marketplace in the United States is highly fragmented. We face competition from traditional franchised dealers who sell both new and used vehicles; independent used powersports dealers; online and mobile sales platforms; and private parties. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our industry are delivering an outstanding consumer experience, competitive sourcing of quality inventory, breadth and depth of product selection, and value pricing.
Our competitors vary in size and breadth of their product offerings. We believe that our principal competitive advantages in powersports sales include our ability to provide a high degree of customer satisfaction with the buying experience by virtue of our platform. We provide customers the opportunity to experience RumbleOn's offerings online, in-store, and through our mobile app, or any combination of those three options. Our ability to make a cash offer to purchase a vehicle with our customer-friendly purchase process, and our breadth of selection of the most popular makes and models available online and in-store provides competitive sourcing and sales. 
RumbleOn's Solution - Creating the Future of Powersports
RumbleOn is creating a best-in-class experience in powersports for our customers. Doing so requires offering unmatched choice and selection and replicating an outstanding customer experience throughout the lifecycle of powersports ownership, one customer and one transaction at a time.
Customers come to RumbleOn's 55 retail locations as well as our more than 60 websites to shop for new and highest-quality used powersports products as well as for parts, accessories and merchandise. We address the entire powersports market. We are reimagining and revolutionizing the customer experience on our technology-led, internet-based platforms, and we are doing so for everyone - from the powersports enthusiast to the novice, and everyone in between - with a focus on four key initiatives:
•Creating an end-to-end ownership experience means we are not focused solely on the initial transaction with a customer. Rather, our customer experience enables building lifelong connectivity to each customer. With each customer interaction, we focus on key touch points that continue to keep our customers engaged throughout their powersports ownership experience. Quality assurance, clear and consistent pricing, professional pickup and delivery, customization, after sales service, and guarantees are just a few of the ways we are building a reliable and consistent customer experience. Our offerings, and our entire customer experience, are designed to turn a single transaction into a lifetime relationship. 
•Providing the largest and best selection of highest-quality inventory enables us to provide many offerings to all powersports customers coast to coast. We are well-positioned to acquire high-quality used vehicles through the strength of our online Cash Offer Tool, a unique and important competitive advantage for RumbleOn. Affording our customers the ability to visit a retail location and receive cash for their used powersports unit instantaneously gives them peace of mind, and provides us the opportunity to drive a meaningful amount of incremental used inventory onto our platform. We are also leveraging robust data from the Cash Offer Tool and from the information acquired from our acquisitions and now being gathered from our 55 RideNow Powersports retail locations to ensure that the right vehicle is in the right place at the right time - with the right price. 
•Building the premier destination for new and used powersports vehicles and introducing more used inventory to our showrooms as well as online attracts new customers to our platform and, most importantly, new riders to the industry due to affordability. We are focused on both new and used, retail sales, however, the opportunity to dramatically increase the number of used powersports unit sales presents our greatest near-term opportunity, as new vehicle inventory supply normalizes. We can better control used inventory than new because used is not dependent on a manufacturer's production, allocation, or distribution constraints. In fact, our broad access to used inventory is - and will continue to be - an important differentiator for RumbleOn in any market environment. 
Our Growth Strategies
The key metric to our powersports business is retail vehicle unit sales, both online and in-store. Unit sales drives revenue and provides the opportunity to build additional revenue through financing, parts, merchandise, and accessories, each of which are higher margin revenue streams. As we scale our business, we will create additional opportunities to expand revenue streams. However, additional revenue opportunities begin with retail vehicle unit sales and, as a result, our growth strategy is focused on this metric.
Our ability to increase vehicle unit sales is a function of our market penetration in existing markets, the number of markets we operate in, and our ability to build and maintain our brands by offering great value, transparency, and an outstanding customer experience. 
Optimize Our Inventory Selection and Centralization
We continue to optimize and broaden the selection of new and used powersports vehicles we make available to our customers. Expanding our inventory selection enhances the customer experience by ensuring each visitor, either online or in-store, finds a vehicle that matches his or her preferences. Optimizing our new inventory significantly depends on continuing our outstanding relationships with our manufacturers ("OEM"). As a result of these relationships, during 2022, we added 60 new franchises to our retail locations, primarily organically, and including three key tuck-in acquisitions in our North Texas market. Optimizing our used inventory selection depends on our ability to source and acquire enough high-quality used vehicles, and our ability to use data to ensure each used vehicle is at the right place, at the right time, at the right price.
We continue implementing our fulfillment strategy with near real-time inventory replenishment to make the right powersports units available in the right quantities at the right locations. This centralization of inventory will launch company-
wide virtual selling through access to all company-owned inventory rather than only those vehicles that might be available at an individual location. Fulfillment will increase the probability that our customers can find their powersports unit of choice on our platform, thereby enhancing the customer experience while eliminating geographic boundaries. With digital inventory integration and over 60 individual websites sharing content and increasing available data, RumbleOn will be top-of-mind for powersports searches. All of the technology infrastructure required has been launched or is under development and will be implemented throughout 2023 and beyond.
Continue to Innovate and Extend Our Technology Leadership
We continue expanding our competitive dominance with leading-edge technology. From our founding, we have been laying the groundwork to offer a friction-free and fully integrated customer experience both online and in-store. We are building the technology engine to enable this integration, while methodically expanding our retail footprint, driving towards online selling without geographic boundaries. With this goal in mind, we intend to launch our new corporate website under the RumbleOn brand during the first half of 2023 and our all new RideNow-branded website later in the second quarter of 2023. Our RideNow website will have unmatched features for our customers, allowing them to see all inventory in one place and it will have the ability to push inventory to individual dealer websites, resulting in a better online presence and customer experience. The plan calls for the constant roll out of new features, as our online presence improves and matures. In conjunction with our integrated CRM, we plan to launch online soft and hard credit pulls and lending pre-qualifications, just to name a few of the exciting features. Lastly, in the first half of 2023, we intend to roll out a new internally developed reporting technology that will increase visibility across our enterprise, improve sales reporting, and provide real time actionable data at the store level. Store managers will now see how they are performing versus expectations and how they compare in real time with their peers across the country.
From the start of RumbleOn, one key differentiator and a lynch pin to the competitive advantage we have built in powersports is our Cash Offer Tool, which supplies proprietary data for thousands of unique Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) inputs. In addition to actual retail sales and transaction data from the acquired RideNow and Freedom Powersports' databases. Marrying this data creates a data-driven "market maker" that does not exist in the industry today. Integrating real-time pricing and sales data from in-store transactions will also enable us to further optimize offers and pricing.
We will continue to make significant investments in improving and adding to our online customer offering, subject to our performance and available operating cash flow as we intend to self-fund these initiatives. We believe that the complexity of the traditional powersports retail transaction provides substantial opportunity for our planned technology investments and that our leadership and continued growth will enable us to invest responsibly in further enhancing the customer experience.
Enhancing Our In-store Experience
Beyond innovative technology and inventory integration, we use our retail locations to augment the online experience- and vice versa - to offer a simple, friction-free customer experience. A key component to transforming the customer experience to support our growth strategy is enhancing the in-store experience and we are strategically expanding our geographic retail footprint. In early 2022, we added 13 additional retail locations, entrenching our position in the North Texas market and expanding our geographic foot print to Alabama and Georgia. In addition, during the first quarter of 2023, we acquired an important multi-line retail location in Tallahassee, Florida, further expanding our dominance in North Florida. We currently operate in 55 retail locations, three fulfillment or hybrid fulfillment/retail locations to open (with four more expected during 2023), one used powersports center, as shown below. 
We employ three primary considerations for expanding our brick-and-mortar presence: (1) attract great people, (2) identify desired locations, and (3) implement appropriate and balanced brand mix.
Attracting Great People. We believe any great customer experience in powersports begins with great people providing consumers the opportunity to fulfill their passion. From our executive team to our customer facing professionals to our back-office and corporate personnel, the RumbleOn team is singularly focused on transforming the customer experience in powersports, both online and in-store. As we expand our physical presence, whether through new retail locations or as we build out our fulfillment centers, finding great people who believe in our mission is key.
Identifying Desired Locations. We believe desired geography means more than finding new markets; it also means making sure we can put the right powersports vehicle in the right place at the right price to maximize our return on the asset. This is a key goal of our fulfillment centers. And of course, we are always looking for strategic acquisition candidates, whether a large group such as Freedom Powersports or a key tuck-in opportunity to improve the capabilities of an existing location.
Implementing Appropriate Brand Mix. Powersports retail provides the opportunity to put many different new brands under one roof along with the proper mix of used inventory. Of course, having that opportunity and taking advantage of that opportunity correctly are two different things. Our outstanding relationships with our OEMs have provided us the opportunity to organically add more than 60 new franchises to our existing retail locations. And we continue leveraging our used inventory sourcing advantage to keep our retail locations fully stocked with the right mix of preferred brands based on data and market share, and thereby further enhance the customer experience.
A fourth consideration also plays a role as we enhance our in-store experience through organic and acquisitive growth: any such investments remain subject to a prudent use of our financial and other resources based on our performance and our available cash from operations as we intend to self-fund our growth.
Develop Broad Consumer Awareness of Our Brand
We believe that creating a unified customer experience, requires a single consumer-facing brand for all our retail locations. During 2022, we began rolling out the “RideNow Powersports” brand across all our retail locations and the 
foundation will be our technology, our infrastructure, and our corporate culture. We are in the early stages of this rollout, and we are encouraged by the impact on performance and the excitement it has clearly created.
RumbleOn Technology
Innovative technology continues to underpin every endeavor at RumbleOn through our ongoing mission to disrupt the powersports industry and our focus on the customer experience. We leverage technology and data to drive change. At a high-level, we believe there are five main areas where leveraging these innovations provides us a competitive advantage and improves the customer experience: (1) our proprietary supply chain pricing and distribution software; (2) our Omnichannel and mobile-first web application; (3) centralized CRM and Inventory; (4) Dealer network support channels; and (5) Data warehousing & reporting, enterprise wide.
 (1) RumbleOn's proprietary supply chain and distribution software:
•Looks at the overall supply chain and reconfigures inventory for the purpose of acquisition and distribution. Our technology aggregates multiple data sources in real-time, tracking and cataloging inventory across the country.
•Analyzes real-time market data to inform our acquisition decisions, continually capturing and archiving such data using advanced algorithms to calibrate pricing and estimate freight and reconditioning expenses. The values are then used in our Cash Offer Tool to quickly determine a fair and reasonable, non-negotiable offer.
 (2) RumbleOn's mobile-first web application strategy:
•Enhances our website and mobile application to provide a compelling customer experience, from the front-end user interface and powerful search tools to enabling secure data, document, and payment exchanges between parties. We also optimize search engine marketing to provide a lower overall cost of customer acquisition. 
 (3) Centralized customer relationship management and centralized inventory
•Enhanced hub of combined RumbleOn, RideNow, and Freedom Powersports customer repositories for marketing, support and service.
•Enterprise-wide centralized inventory, enhancing distribution, pricing, allocation and growth.
 (4) Dealer network support channels
•New enhancements for our dealerships, provides on-demand pricing, transfers of allocation through streamlined workflows at the pace of business to benefit the needs of our customers.
 (5) Data warehousing and reporting, enterprise-wide
•The combined digital intelligence from RideNow, Freedom Powersports, and RumbleOn has produced a rich eco-system of available data to promote growth across all facets of the business concerning parts, service, sales, marketing, and retention. 
To deliver our supply chain software and on-line strategies, RumbleOn leverages its proprietary and exclusive-use technology portfolio, which includes:
•A series of modeling tools & technologies for consolidating internal and external data to provide profitability estimates for inventory available for purchase;
•A proprietary series of inventory management and business intelligence technologies that tracks the lifecycle of a vehicle from acquisition through delivery;
•An automated photography technology that combines high-quality photos to produce an interactive, 360-degree virtual tour of the vehicle;
•A catalog of websites that includes advanced filtering and search technology that assist multi-lead generation across participating partners; and
•A proprietary transportation management system and assignment technology to optimize the transport of purchased inventory for acquisition and dealer distribution.
In addition to our proprietary/exclusive use technology, we also rely on third party technology, including the following:
•A cloud based network infrastructure for hosting websites, inventory data, CRM-Data/reporting;
•Software libraries, development environments, and tools;
•Services to allow customers to digitally sign contracts; select local services; and
•Online customer service call center management software.
In short, our business is driven by data and technology at all stages of the process, from acquisition, inventory purchasing, reconditioning, photography, transportation, and annotation through in-store or online merchandising, sales, financing, trade-ins, logistics, and delivery.
We protect our technology and other intellectual property through a combination of trademarks, domain names, copyrights, trade secrets, patented technology, and contractual provisions and restrictions on access and use of our proprietary information and technology. We have a portfolio of trademark registrations in the United States, including registrations for "RumbleOn," the RumbleOn logo, "RideNow," and the RideNow logo. We are the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names, including "rumbleon.com."
Operational Structure
The following chart summarizes our organizational structure as of December 31, 2022. This chart is provided for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect all legal entities owned or controlled by us:
Seasonality
Historically, the powersports industry has been seasonal with traffic and sales strongest in the spring and summer quarters. Sales and traffic are typically slowest in the winter quarter but increase typically in the spring season, coinciding with tax refunds and improved weather conditions. Given this seasonality, we expect our quarterly results of operations, including 
our revenue, gross profit, net income (loss), and cash flow to vary accordingly. Over time, we expect to normalize to seasonal trends, using data and logistics to move inventory to the right place, at the right time, at the right price.
Government Regulation
Various aspects of our business are or may be subject, directly or indirectly, to U.S. federal and state laws and regulations. Failure to comply with such laws or regulations may result in the suspension or termination of our ability to do business in affected jurisdictions or the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties, including fines or the award of significant damages against us and our dealers in class action or other civil litigation.
Vehicle Sales. Our sale and purchase of vehicles, both new and pre-owned, related products and services, and third-party finance products, are subject to the state and local dealer licensing requirements in the jurisdictions in which we have retail or wholesale locations. Regulators of jurisdictions where our customers reside, but in which we do not have a dealer or financing license could require that we obtain a license or otherwise comply with various state regulations. Despite our belief that we are not subject to the licensing requirements of those jurisdictions in which we do not have a physical presence, regulators may seek to impose punitive fines for operating without a license or demand we seek a license in those jurisdictions, any of which may inhibit our ability to do business in those jurisdictions, increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Consumer Finance. The financing we offer customers is subject to federal and state laws regulating the advertising and provision of consumer finance options, the collection of consumer credit and financial information, along with requirements related to online payments and electronic funds transfers, the regulations and state licenses applicable depend upon whether RumbleOn Finance or a third-party is the entity extending credit to such customers. Most states regulate retail installment sales, including setting a maximum interest rate, caps on certain fees, or maximum amounts financed. In addition, certain states require that finance companies file a notice of intent or have a sales finance license or an installment sellers license in order to solicit or originate installment sales in that state.
Logistics and Transportation. Our Wholesale Express logistics operations, which brokers and facilitates the transportation of vehicles primarily between and among dealers, is subject to motor-carrier rules and regulations promulgated by the United States Department of Transportation ("DOT") and the states through which their customers' vehicles are transported. Additionally, the vendors whom Wholesale Express relies upon are subject to federal and state regulation concerning transport vehicle dimensions, transport vehicle conditions, driver motor vehicle record history, driver alcohol and drug testing, and driver hours of service. More restrictive limitations on vehicle weight and size, condition, trailer length and configuration, methods of measurement, driver qualifications, or driver hours of service may increase the costs charged to Wholesale Express by its vendors, which may adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. If we fail to comply with the DOT regulations or if those regulations become more stringent, we could be subject to increased inspections, audits, or compliance burdens. Regulatory authorities could take remedial action including imposing fines, suspending, or shutting down our Wholesale Express operations. 
Environmental Laws and Regulations. We are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations that pertain to our operations. The regulations concern material storage, air quality, waste handling, and water pollution control. The regulations also regulate our use and operation of gasoline storage tanks, gasoline dispensing equipment, oil tanks, and paint booths among other things. Our business involves the use, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, including motor oil, gasoline, solvents, lubricants, paints, and other substances. We manage our compliance through permitting and operational control.
Facilities and Personnel. Our facilities and business operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and health and safety, and our employment practices are subject to various laws and regulations, including complex federal, state, and local wage and hour and anti-discrimination laws. We may also be liable for employee misconduct and violations of laws or regulations to which we are subject. 
Federal Advertising Regulations. The Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") has authority to take actions to remedy or prevent advertising practices that it considers to be unfair or deceptive and that affect commerce in the United States. If the FTC takes the position in the future that any aspect of our business constitutes an unfair or deceptive advertising practice, responding to such allegations could require us to pay significant damages, settlements, and civil penalties, or could require us to make adjustments to our products and services, any or all of which could result in substantial adverse publicity, loss of participating dealers, lost revenue, increased expenses, and decreased profitability.
Federal Antitrust Laws. The antitrust laws prohibit, among other things, any joint conduct among competitors that would lessen competition in the marketplace. Some of the information that we may obtain from dealers may be sensitive and, if 
disclosed inappropriately, could impede competition or otherwise diminish independent pricing activity. A governmental or private civil action alleging the improper exchange of information, or unlawful participation in price maintenance or other unlawful or anticompetitive activity, even if unfounded, could be costly to defend and adversely impact our ability to maintain and grow our business.
In addition, governmental or private civil actions related to the antitrust laws could result in orders suspending or terminating our ability to do business or otherwise altering or limiting certain of our business practices, including the manner in which we handle or disclose pricing information, or the imposition of significant civil or criminal penalties, including fines or the award of significant damages against us in class action or other civil litigation.
Other. In addition to these laws and regulations that apply specifically to our business, we are also subject to laws and regulations affecting public companies, including securities laws and the listing rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq"). The violation of any of these laws or regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal penalties or in a cease-and-desist order against our business operations, any of which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations. We have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenses and other costs to comply with these laws and regulations.
 The foregoing description of laws and regulations to which we are or may be subject is not exhaustive, and the regulatory framework governing our operations is subject to continuous change. The enactment of new laws and regulations or the interpretation of existing laws and regulations in an unfavorable way may affect the operation of our business, directly or indirectly, which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs, civil or criminal penalties, including fines, adverse publicity, loss of participating dealers, lost revenue, increased expenses, and decreased profitability. Further, investigations by government agencies, including the FTC, into allegedly anticompetitive, unfair, deceptive or other business practices by us, could cause us to incur additional expenses and, if adversely concluded, could result in substantial civil or criminal penalties and significant legal liability.

As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2,717 full time and 84 part-time employees.
