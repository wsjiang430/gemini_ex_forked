About Us
 
Founded in 1903, Holley, Inc. (“Holley” or the “Company”) has been a part of the automotive industry for well over a century. We are a leading designer, marketer, and manufacturer of high-performance automotive aftermarket products for car and truck enthusiasts. Our products span a number of automotive platforms and are sold across multiple channels. We attribute a major component of our success to our brands, including “Holley”, “APR”, “MSD” and “Flowmaster”, among others. In addition, we have recently added to our brand lineup through a series of strategic acquisitions, including our 2022 acquisitions of substantially all the assets of John’s Ind., Inc. (“John’s”), Southern Kentucky Classics (“SKC”), and Vesta Motorsports USA, Inc., d.b.a. RaceQuip (“RaceQuip”), our 2021 acquisitions of substantially all the assets of AEM Performance Electronics (“AEM”), Classic Instruments LLC (“Classic Instruments”), ADS Precision Machining, Inc., d.b.a. Arizona Desert Shocks (“ADS”), Baer, Inc, d.b.a. Baer Brakes (“Baer”), Brothers Mail Order Industries, Inc., d.b.a. Brothers Trucks (“Brothers”), Rocket Performance Machine, Inc., d.b.a. Rocket Racing Wheels (“Rocket”), and Speartech Fuel Injections Systems, Inc. (“Speartech”), and our 2020 acquisitions of Simpson Racing Products, Inc. (“Simpson”), Drake Automotive Group LLC (“Drake”) and Detroit Speed, Inc. (“Detroit Speed”). Through these strategic acquisitions, we have increased our market position in the otherwise highly fragmented performance automotive aftermarket industry.

We operate in the performance automotive aftermarket parts industry. We believe there is ample opportunity to continue our expansion into new products and markets, such as exterior accessories and mobile electronics, representing a natural progression for us to grow market share as these adjacencies are driven by passionate enthusiasts, consistent with our core categories. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Holley’s Business and Industry—If the Company is unable to successfully design, develop and market new products, the Company business may be harmed” for a discussion of the risks related to the Company’s new product development.
 
On July 16, 2021, we consummated a business combination (“Business Combination”) pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated March 11, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Empower Ltd., (“Empower”), Empower Merger Sub I Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Empower (“Merger Sub I”), Empower Merger Sub II LLC, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Empower (“Merger Sub II”), and Holley Intermediate Holdings, Inc. ("Holdings"). The Merger Agreement provided for, among other things, the following transactions: (i) Merger Sub I merged with and into Holdings, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub I ceased, and Holdings became the surviving corporation, and (ii) Holdings merged with and into Merger Sub II, the separate corporate existence of Holdings ceased, and Merger Sub II became the surviving limited liability company. Upon closing, Empower changed its name to Holley Inc. and its trading symbol on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) from “EMPW” to “HLLY.”
 
Business Strategy
 
Our vision is to be the most compelling and inclusive platform for automotive enthusiasts, to inspire and support enthusiasts’ transition to cleaner, more sustainable technologies, and to further accelerate the automotive lifestyle. Our aim is to provide a platform where automotive enthusiasts can purchase aftermarket auto parts for both old model restorations and new vehicle enhancements. We believe our consumers are enthusiastic and passionate about the performance and the personalization of their classic and modern cars. We aim to provide the products and service they need to pursue that passion. We will continue to drive growth and value for our shareholders through our key strategies:

• | Continuous New Product Development: New products allow us to increase market share in existing categories, extend into adjacent categories, capture new enthusiast consumers and extend or further penetrate new vehicle platforms. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Holley’s Business and Industry—If the Company is unable to successfully design, develop and market new products, the Company business may be harmed” for a discussion of the risks related to the Company’s new product development.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Accelerate Growth Through Continued M&A: We have historically used strategic acquisitions to expand our brand portfolio, enter new product categories and consumer segments, and expand share in current product categories. While we believe our business is positioned for continued organic growth, we intend to continue evaluating opportunities for strategic acquisitions that complement our current business and expand our addressable target market. We believe that our scalable business platform, relationships with our distribution and channel partners, strong loyalty with our growing consumer base, and experienced management team and board of directors, position us to realize the benefits from the integration of recent acquisitions and prime us for future acquisitions. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Holley’s Business and Industry—The Company may acquire or invest in other companies, which could divert the Company management’s attention, result in dilution to the Company stockholders, and otherwise disrupt the Company operations and harm the Company business, sales, financial condition and results of operations” for a discussion of the risks related to the Company’s M&A activity.

• | Expand Direct-to-Consumer (“DTC”) Sales and Further Engage with Our Consumers: We are highly focused on deepening our engagement with our enthusiast consumers and selling them products through our fast-growing online platform. We have multiple touch points in our consumer ecosystem, ranging from social media to our website, to our many in-person enthusiast events. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Holley’s Business and Industry—If the Company’s plans to increase sales through its DTC channel are not successful, the Company’s business, sales, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed” for a discussion of the risks related to the Company’s DTC channel.

Competition
 
The performance automotive industry is highly competitive, and we face substantial competition in all the markets that we serve. The principal factors on which industry participants compete include technical features, performance, product design, innovation, reliability and durability, brand, time to market, customer service, reliable order execution, and price. Our success in the marketplace depends on our ability to execute our Business Strategy discussed above.
 
The performance automotive aftermarket parts industry in the United States is large and highly fragmented. In addition, we have seen consistent growth within the automotive aftermarket parts industry over the last two decades. Products in the performance automotive aftermarket parts industry range from functional products that enhance vehicle performance to products that improve safety, stability, handling and appearance.
 
    5 

  

Our core competitive set is comprised of four primary types of competitors with fragmentation across the majority of our major product categories:
 

• | Multi-product category providers: legacy brands with coverage across multiple performance aftermarket products with multiple brands often under one banner and built through acquisition. We are one of the largest multi-product category brands in the performance automotive aftermarket based on gross sales.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Single-product category providers: established companies focused on one product category in the market primarily selling via resellers. Single-product category providers generally offer either lower priced products or higher-quality products focused within one product category.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | E-Tailer Private Labels: traditional online resellers sell other manufactured products and offer private label products, often at a lower price point. E-tailer private labels generally occupy the value end of the market and have a greater presence in less engineered categories with less product-specific brand strength.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Niche custom manufacturers: while not our core competitors, smaller shops typically focus on fully customizing specific make or model vehicles. Niche custom manufacturers are typically local or regionally focused, and some also may resell customized products from other manufactured brands.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe the following factors distinguish Holley from its competitors:
 

• | Brand that resonates with enthusiasts: we actively engage enthusiasts at the platform level across multiple channels (e.g., events, digital media, online communities, etc.), creating reference networks for potential consumers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Innovative, product development: we invest heavily in product research, innovation and development, and introduce products that meet latest platform and use case-specific needs of our enthusiast consumers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Operational ability that enables efficient order execution: we make significant investments in sourcing, manufacturing and distribution excellence, enabling management of multiple product lines while maintaining scale and attractive relative pricing.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Differentiated go-to-market strategy: we offer a mix of single product and platform-oriented solutions across DTC and reseller channels, delivering a strong overall consumer experience.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brands
 
We have a strong portfolio of brands covering various product categories. Our portfolio consists of over 70 brands spanning across 30 product categories. Our top seven brands generated 68% of our sales in 2022.
 

• | Holley EFI: Currently our largest brand and represented 14% of our sales for 2022. Our Holley EFI brand focuses on electronic fuel injection technology and showcases our new product development engine.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Holley: Currently our second largest brand and represented 14% of our sales for 2022. The Holley brand resonates with consumers as the majority of automotive enthusiast consumers recognize the Holley brand. Holley offers a variety of products across multiple categories but traces its roots back to carburetors which originally made the brand famous with automotive enthusiasts.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | MSD: Currently our third leading brand and represented 10% of our sales for 2022. MSD has historically been focused on production of ignition products but today has been more focused on developing electronics for the powertrain category.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Simpson: Currently our fourth leading brand and represented 9% of our sales for 2022. Simpson was acquired in 2020 and has focused on motorsport safety products including helmets, head and neck restraints, seat belts and fire suits.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Powerteq: Currently our fifth leading brand and represented 8% of our sales for 2022. Powerteq is focused on exhaust, intakes, drivetrain and engine tuning products and accessories.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Accel: Currently our sixth largest brand and represented 7% of our sales in 2022. Accel is focused on performance fuel and ignition systems.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Flowmaster: Currently our seventh largest brand and represented 6% of our sales in 2022. Flowmaster's main focus is on developing exhaust products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe the popularity of our brands is the result of consistently delivering high quality, innovative products that resonate with our enthusiast consumers. Our brands have allowed us to build direct, trusted and long-lasting relationships with our consumers and resellers.

Product Development
 
   We offer our enthusiast consumers a comprehensive suite of performance automotive aftermarket products to meet a wide range of needs. We are continuously innovating and evolving our product offerings to meet ever-changing consumer needs. We invest heavily in developing new products, spending an average of $20.5 million per year on research and development since 2017 . We believe our product development capabilities will enable us to create sustainable long-term growth and margin enhancements for our business. 


We have a history of developing innovative products, including new products in existing categories like Electronic Fuel Injection, product line expansions, and products that bring us into new markets including components for converting ICE vehicles to electric powertrains. We have thoughtfully expanded our product portfolio over time to adapt to consumer needs and find solutions to new consumer demands. We expand our existing product families and enter new product categories by creating solutions grounded in our expert insights and relevant market knowledge. We believe we have a meaningful runway across our target product categories and product vintages, and we are well positioned for future growth by expanding in adjacent and transformational categories that present opportunities for further market penetration in the Performance Suspension, Braking and Powertrain Conversion Systems markets. We believe there are also opportunities to capitalize on growing our powertrain agnostic categories like Automotive and Motorcycle Safety.
 
Suppliers
 
We run a flexible sourcing model with a mix of global sourcing and in-house manufacturing. Our best value sourcing model decisions are based on a mix of cost, quality and service. We have a diverse global supplier base and no material supplier concentration. Our efficient sourcing model enables strong gross margins and cash conversion.
 
We believe there is an adequate supply of raw materials and key components; however, there can be no assurance over the long term that the availability of materials and components or increases in commodity prices will not materially affect our business or results of operations. Ongoing supply chain disruptions, resulting in supply shortages and higher shipping charges, have and could continue to impact our ability to maintain supplies of products and the costs associated with obtaining raw materials and key components. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions due to the global supply shortage of automotive-grade microchips, which has resulted in increased microchip delivery lead times.
 
Marketing
 
We reach and engage our consumers where they participate in the performance automotive aftermarket – online and in person. Our marketing strategy is centered on strong brand equity, leading new product innovation capabilities and delivering consistently high-quality products. In 2022, we spent approximately $11.6 million (or approximately 2% of our 2022 annual gross sales) on marketing and advertising. Going forward, consistent with our value creation strategies, we intend to continue our investments in direct consumer marketing and advertising as well as refocus our current mix of spending towards activities believed to generate the highest return on investment. We believe these strategies will have a meaningfully positive impact across our brand portfolio.
 
In recent years, we have shifted our marketing efforts towards digital advertising and have increased investments in consumer engagement directly via digital and social media platforms and campaigns. Additionally, since mid-2020 we increased resources focused on expanding our e-commerce and digital platforms. These efforts have included turning Holley.com into a destination for automotive enthusiasts and launching Motor Life, our internal digital publication that is available to the public on our website. As a result, we have experienced a significant increase in social media and online engagement since that time. Continued expansion of and investment in digital and social media are expected in the future, including focusing on strategies to grow the high margin DTC channel.
 
We have also spent significant time and effort in creating engaging, in-person events to build the Holley tribe. These events focus on creating memorable experiences for enthusiasts, celebrate car culture, build community and show enthusiasts how Holley products can help them enjoy their vehicles. Since 2015, our events have grown in total annual attendance from 14,000 to106,000 in2022. We currently host seven annual self-funding events, including LS Fest East, LS Fest West, Ford Fest, MoParty, High Voltage, Brother's Truck Show, plus a new event launched in 2022, LS Fest Texas, our largest inaugural event to date. 
 
Sales and Distribution
 
We have a diverse omni-channel distribution strategy led by our growing DTC channel. Our omni-channel model enables us to reach our consumers through DTC, E-tailer, warehouse distributor, traditional retailer, and jobber/ installer channels. We have mutually beneficial relationships with our resellers and are able to maintain strong pricing discipline across our channels with strict conformance to minimum advertised pricing.
 
    7 

  

DTC channel: Consumers are increasingly meeting us online through our DTC channel. Our DTC channel provides consumers full access to all of our brands, our unique branded content and our full product assortment. We have turned Holley.com into our primary hub for consumer communication and continue to add features and brands that make it an increasingly attractive digital destination for our consumers. Our DTC channel enables us to directly interact with our customers, more effectively control our brand experience, better understand consumer behavior and preferences, and offer exclusive products, content, and customization capabilities. We believe our control over our DTC channel provides our customers with quality brand engagement and further builds customer loyalty, while generating attractive margins.
 
Resellers: We have historically sold the majority of our products through resellers who purchase our products and resell them through various channels. These resellers consist of E-tailers, warehouse distributors, traditional retailers, and jobber/installers with E-tailers and warehouse distributors accounting for 60% of our sales in 2022, and our top ten resellers accounting for 39% of our sales in 2022 with our largest reseller making up 19% of our sales in 2022.
 
We have established mutually beneficial and long-term relationships with our resellers. We believe resellers benefit from our broad suite of product offerings that they can leverage to meet consumer demand across multiple product categories. Based on the value that we offer to our resellers, we are able to operate with pricing discipline that supports the value of our products in the marketplace and buttresses our profit margins. We believe our approach to pricing allows us to better understand consumer demand and identify what our end consumers are buying.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Patents, trademarks, and other proprietary rights are important to the continued success of our business. We own and have licensing arrangements for a number of U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks, and other proprietary rights related to our products and business. We also rely upon continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including the use of confidentiality and other similar agreements. We do not consider our business to be dependent on any single patent, nor is the expiration of any patent expected to materially affect our business. Our current patents will expire over various periods and we continue to file new patent applications on newly developed technology. From time to time, we become aware of potential infringement of our patent, trademark, or other proprietary rights, and we investigate instances of alleged infringement where we believe it is merited and take appropriate actions under applicable intellectual property laws in response to such infringements where we determine it is valuable to do so. Similarly, from time to time we are the subject of intellectual property and other proprietary rights related suits and other litigation.
Seasonality
 
Holley’s operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond the Company’s control. Traditionally, our sales in the first half of the year are generally higher than in the second half of the year. Due to these factors and others, which may be unknown to the Company at this time, operating results in future periods can be expected to fluctuate. Accordingly, the Company’s historical results of operations may not be indicative of future performance.
Regulations
 
We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air or water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Some of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and reduce air and water pollution. These permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all material environmental laws and regulations applicable to our plants and operations. Historically, our annual costs of achieving and maintaining compliance with environmental, health and safety requirements have not been material to our financial results.
 
Increasing global efforts to control emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, nitrogen oxide and other greenhouse gases and pollutants, as well as the shifting focus of regulatory efforts towards total emissions output, have the potential to impact our facilities, costs, products and customers. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has taken action to control greenhouse gases from certain stationary and mobile sources. In addition, several states have taken steps, such as adoption of cap-and-trade programs or other regulatory systems, to address greenhouse gases. There have also been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases. These developments and further actions that may be taken in the U.S. and in other countries, states or provinces could affect our operations both positively and negatively (e.g., by affecting the demand for or suitability of some of our products).
 
    8 

  

We also may be subject to liability as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and similar state or foreign laws for contaminated properties that we currently own, lease or operate or that we or our predecessors have previously owned, leased or operated, and sites to which we or our predecessors sent hazardous substances. Such liability may be joint and several so that we may be liable for more than our share of any contamination, and any such liability may be determined without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination. We or our predecessors have been named potentially responsible parties at contaminated sites from time to time. We do not anticipate any potential liability relating to contaminated sites to be material to our financial results.
 
Employees
 
Holley’s employees are integral to our strategic growth and success. We consider our team members to be our most valuable asset and seek to attract and maintain the highest quality talent by offering competitive benefits and wellness services, opportunities to grow professionally, and regular evaluations, among other initiatives. As of December 31, 2022, we employed 1,622 full-time employees and 100 temporary employees. Approximately 48% of our full-time employees are based primarily in our Bowling Green, KY headquarters, distribution center and manufacturing plants. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements or represented by a labor union. We believe our facilities are in labor markets with ready access to adequate numbers of skilled and unskilled workers, and we believe our relations with our employees are good.
 
Many of our employees are automotive enthusiasts. We pride ourselves on having a platform built for enthusiasts by enthusiasts. As of December 2022, our Engineering function includes approximately 203 employees, including many enthusiast-focused engineers who are passionate about cars. We continue to seek out top level talent that will help accomplish our mission and vision moving forward. Our goal is to create an inclusive and safe environment for our employees that keeps them engaged in their work.
 
Compensation and Benefits. We strive to hire, develop and retain top talent. We attract and reward our employees by providing competitive benefits, including market-competitive compensation, medical, dental and vision insurance, short-term and long-term disability insurance, basic life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, voluntary supplemental coverages, flexible spending accounts, paid time off, and our 401(k) program. Holley matches employee contributions to the 401(k) Plan up to 3.5% each pay period, and an additional discretionary match of up to 1.5% is made based on company performance to targets.
Health, Safety and Wellness. Holley is committed to the health and well-being of its employees and designs its compensation and benefit programs to demonstrate this commitment. Our programs are intended to support the physical and mental well-being of our employees and their families by providing the tools and resources for employees to improve or maintain their health and to lessen concerns about missing work and the potential financial impact.
 
Employee health and safety in the workplace is one of our top priorities. We have implemented programs and training designed to eliminate workplace incidents, risks and hazards. The core training provided includes Emergency Response, OSHA Reporting, Fire Safety, and Office Ergonomics. We also review and monitor our performance closely. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we followed guidance from the Centers for Disease Control, the World Health Organization, and the various states and counties in which we operate in order to keep our employees safe. We will continue to make the health and wellbeing of our employees a priority.
 
Inclusion. We know that diversity throughout our company creates stronger teams, leads to innovation, and results in an organization that provides the best service to our customers. We have a recruitment strategy that encourages diversity across the company. We leverage our employee referral program to identify diverse talent during the recruitment process. We also engage with a local development board and a local refugee center in Bowling Green, KY to increase our diverse talent candidate pool. 
 
We believe our employees should reflect the customers we serve. Notably, approximately 30% of Holley consumers are female. Accordingly, we recognize the benefits of female representation in our workforce, and in 2022 over 30% of our workforce were women. We are committed to closing the gender gap and our recruitment and retention strategies support improving women’s representation in leadership roles.
 
Our Culture. At Holley, we believe that an engaged workforce leads to a more innovative, productive, and profitable organization. For this reason, we measure employee engagement through periodic culture surveys. These surveys allow our employees to provide confidential feedback on culture, company strategy and trust in their direct leaders. This feedback helps create action plans to improve the engagement of our employees. These survey results have demonstrated that our employees have a strong sense of belonging, trust in management, and confidence in Holley. These strengths provide a foundation for our success, and we are dedicated to enhancing the employee experience at Holley.

Talent Development. The development of our employees’ skills and knowledge is critical to Holley’s success. Our educational assistance program is designed to encourage personal development by helping employees maintain and improve their skills or knowledge related to their current job or a potential future position at Holley through reimbursement of certain educational expenses, including external training programs or educational courses, pursuit and maintenance of job-related professional licenses and certifications, workshops, seminars, and professional conferences. Further, we are introducing an internship program designed to provide students in the community an opportunity to gain practical experience. We are committed to fostering an equitable work environment that seeks to ensure fair treatment, equality of opportunity, and fairness in access to information and resources.
Social Responsibility. We are committed to social responsibility. Our socially responsible initiatives include donations to community organizations, sponsorship of local sports teams and weekend family events. Through these programs, Holley and its employees are able to give back to the community through monetary donations and by providing community services. Holley gives its subsidiaries the ability to lead their own community engagement initiatives through contributions to charities and participation in fundraising events.
