 Item 1. Business.
 Company Overview
 American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. (the “Company,” "AEO," “we,”, "us," and “our”) is a leading global specialty retailer. We operate and license over 1,400 retail stores worldwide and are online at www.ae.com and www.aerie.com in the United States and internationally. Our brands are connected under the core tenet of REAL, which is inclusive, optimistic, and empowering and celebrates self-expression. Our purpose is to show the world that there's REAL power in the optimism of youth.
We offer a broad assortment of high-quality, on-trend apparel, accessories, and personal care products at affordable prices for men and women under the American Eagle brand, and intimates, apparel, active wear, and swim collections under the Aerie brand. We sell directly to consumers through our retail channel, which includes our stores and concession-based shop-within-shops. We operate stores in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Hong Kong, and Japan. We also have license agreements with third parties to operate American Eagle and Aerie stores and online marketplace businesses throughout Asia, Europe, India, Latin America, and the Middle East.
We also operate Todd Snyder New York (“Todd Snyder”), a premium menswear brand, and Unsubscribed, which focuses on consciously made, slow fashion.
 In Fiscal 2021, we acquired AirTerra, Inc. ("AirTerra") and Quiet Logistics, Inc. ("Quiet Logistics"), creating a new supply chain platform ("Quiet Platforms”). Quiet Logistics is a logistics company that operates a network of in-market fulfillment centers, locating products closer to need, creating inventory efficiencies, cost benefits and affordable same-day and next-day delivery options for customers and stores. AirTerra is a logistics service and platform that solves e-commerce fulfillment and shipping challenges in a unique and innovative way for retailers and brands of all sizes. Both acquisitions represent an important step in building our supply chain platform, as part of our ongoing supply chain transformation strategy of leveraging scale and innovation to help us manage costs and improve service.
 Operating Segments
 The Company has identified two operating segments (American Eagle brand and Aerie brand) that also represent our reportable segments and reflect the Chief Operating Decision Maker’s (defined as our CEO) internal view of analyzing results and allocating resources.

Licensed Operations
 Our international licensing partners acquire the right to sell, promote, market, and/or distribute various categories of our products in a given geographic area and to source products from us. International licensees' rights include the right to own and operate retail stores and may include rights to sell in wholesale markets and shop-in-shop concessions and operate online marketplace businesses. As of January 28, 2023, our international licensing partners operated in 269 licensed retail

stores and concessions, as well as wholesale markets, online brand sites, and online marketplaces in approximately 30 countries.
We plan to continue to increase the number of locations under license agreements or similar arrangements as part of our disciplined approach to global expansion.
 AEO Direct
 We sell merchandise through our digital channels, www.ae.com, www.aerie.com, www.toddsnyder.com, www.unsubscribed.com, and our AEO apps, both domestically and internationally in approximately 80 countries. We also sell merchandise on various international online marketplaces. The digital channels reinforce each particular brand platform and are designed to complement the in-store experience.
Over the past several years, we have invested in building our technologies and digital capabilities. We focused our investments in three key areas: making significant advances in mobile technology, investing in digital marketing and improving the digital customer experience.
Omni-Channel
 In addition to our investments in technology, we have invested in building omni-channel capabilities to better serve customers and gain operational efficiencies. These upgraded technologies provide a single view of inventory across channels, connecting physical stores directly to our digital store and providing our customers with a more convenient and improved shopping experience. Our United States and Canadian distribution centers and our Quiet Logistics regional distribution centers are fully omni-channel and service both stores and digital businesses. We offer the ability for customers to return products seamlessly via any channel regardless of where the products were originally purchased. We also offer a variety of channels to fulfill customer orders. These include “ship to home,” which can be fulfilled either through our distribution center or our store sites (buy online, ship from stores) when purchased online or through our app; “store pick-up,” which consists of online orders being fulfilled either in store or curbside, and “store-to-door” where customers order within our store, and the goods are shipped directly to their home.
Customer Loyalty Program
 Real Rewards by American Eagle and Aerie (the “Program”) is a highly digitized loyalty program that launched in June 2020. The Program features a variety of benefits for loyalty members and credit card members.
 Real Rewards by American Eagle and Aerie highlights include:
•Faster earn rates, which equal more rewards;
 •Exclusive access to member promotions, discounts, and experiences; 
 •Free shipping perks; and
 •Special cardmember discounts and tier benefits. 
 Under the Program, members accumulate points based on purchase activity and earn rewards by reaching certain point thresholds. Members earn dollar rewards in the form of discount savings certificates. Rewards earned are valid through the stated expiration date, which is 60 days from the issuance date of the reward. Rewards not redeemed during the 60-day redemption period are forfeited.
Merchandise Suppliers
 We design our merchandise, which is manufactured by third-party factories. During Fiscal 2022, we purchased substantially all of our merchandise from non North American suppliers. We sourced merchandise through approximately 330 vendors located throughout the world, primarily in Asia, and did not source more than 10% of our merchandise from any single factory or supplier. Although we purchase a significant portion of our merchandise through a single international buying agent, we do not maintain any exclusive commitments to purchase from any one vendor.
 We maintain quality control departments at our distribution centers to inspect incoming merchandise shipments for overall quality of manufacturing. Inspections are also made by our employees and agents at manufacturing facilities to identify quality issues prior to shipment of merchandise.


We uphold an extensive factory inspection program to monitor compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct. New garment factories must pass an initial inspection in order to do business with us and we continue to review their performance against our guidelines regarding working conditions, employment practices, and compliance with local laws through internal audits by our compliance team and the use of third-party monitors. We strive to partner with suppliers who respect local laws and share our dedication to utilize best practices in human rights, labor rights, environmental practices, and workplace safety. We are a certified, validated member of the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism program (“CTPAT”), a designation we have held since 2004. CTPAT is a voluntary program offered by United States Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) in which an importer agrees to work with CBP to strengthen overall supply chain security. In 2016, we were accepted into the Apparel, Footwear, and Textiles Center, one of CBP’s Centers of Excellence and Expertise (“CEE”). The CEEs were created to ensure uniformity, create efficiencies, reduce redundancies, enhance industry expertise, and facilitate trade, all with a final goal of reduced costs at the border and allowing CBP to focus on high-risk shipments.
 Inventory and Distribution
 Merchandise is shipped directly from our vendors, and deconsolidated through trans loaders to our Company-owned distribution centers in Hazleton, Pennsylvania and Ottawa, Kansas, our Quiet Logistics regional distribution centers strategically located throughout the United States, or our Canadian distribution center in Mississauga, Ontario. Additionally, some products are shipped directly to stores, which reduces transit times and lowers operating costs. We contract with third-party distribution centers in Mexico, Hong Kong and Japan to service our Company-owned stores and e-commerce operations in those regions.
Regulation
 We and our products are subject to regulation by various federal, state, local, and foreign regulatory authorities. Substantially all of our products are manufactured by foreign suppliers and imported by us, and we are subject to a variety of trade laws, customs regulations, and international trade agreements. Apparel and other products sold by us are under the jurisdiction of multiple governmental agencies and regulations, including, in the United States, the Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Products Safety Commission. These regulations relate principally to product labeling, marketing, licensing requirements, and consumer product safety requirements and regulatory testing. We are also subject to regulations governing our employees both globally and in the United States, and by disclosure and reporting requirements for publicly traded companies established under existing or new federal or state laws, including the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”).
 Our licensing partners, buying/sourcing agents, and the vendors and factories with which we contract for the manufacture and distribution of our products are also subject to regulation. Our agreements require our licensing partners, buying/sourcing agents, vendors, and factories to operate in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and we are not aware of any violations that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated business or operating results.
 Human Capital Management
 Our people come first. As of January 28, 2023, we employed approximately 40,000 associates throughout the world, of whom approximately 32,000 were part-time or seasonal associates. We employed 32,800 associates in the United States, of whom approximately 26,400 were part-time or seasonal associates.
 
Our values of People, Innovation, Passion, Integrity, and Teamwork are the backbone of our Company and are at the center of every decision, every product and every interaction - they represent the foundation of our REAL culture. We all have a vital role to play in creating an environment where everyone feels respected and empowered while we continue to grow as a community that promotes individuality and difference. We celebrate the diversity of one through the inclusion of many.
 To evaluate our REAL culture, we look holistically at all the beliefs, values and behaviors that reflect how our best work is done. We aim to ensure there is alignment between what is espoused and what is practiced. Our consistently strong internal employee satisfaction scores, corporate exit survey data, and external Glassdoor ratings demonstrate the achievement of this goal.


Our culture model is composed of Listening, Observing, Supporting, and Informing:
 •Listening to our associates, customers and candidates through reviews of culture surveys, exit surveys, Glassdoor reporting, LinkedIn responses, and hotline reporting; we also conduct open-door engagement, Company-wide town halls, and roundtables on a periodic basis.
 •Observing who we are and what our associates are doing by regularly reviewing our demographic data and retention rates.
 •Supporting a positive Company culture through programs and processes for eligible associates that promote our strong values and address leadership development opportunities, work-life integration, well-being initiatives, fair pay initiatives, family support, and inclusion and diversity programs.
 •Informing and clearly communicating our values, modeling the behaviors we expect, and providing training and feedback.
 
Our Board of Directors (our “Board”) plays an important role in the oversight of our talent and culture and devotes time each quarter to receiving updates from senior management on employee engagement, turnover and retention rates, inclusion and diversity, talent development, leadership, and succession planning initiatives.
 During Fiscal 2022, we prioritized growth through developing our people, our brands, and our operations. Our growth of people focused on supporting the health and well-being of our associates, customers and communities while also reimagining connection and collaboration and remaining diligent in the execution of our corporate social responsibility objectives.
TALENT MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS
 We utilize an integrated set of talent management tools and programs, rooted in our values, that thread through the entire talent life cycle. Consistent talent reviews, performance evaluations, equitable pay practices and succession planning have contributed to a full-time voluntary and mutual turnover rate, including our store associates, of approximately 28% for Fiscal 2022, which is consistent with our retail peer group and compares to a 27% five-year Company average. Associate development is supported through numerous programs, including AEO Academy, an online training platform that provides eligible associates with continuous learning opportunities. AEO Academy has nearly 2,900 modules, which aggregate were completed over one million times during Fiscal 2022, with a total of 14.9 million views on the platform since it was launched in late Fiscal 2019. Our focus on associate development led to a full-time promotion rate of approximately 26% for Fiscal 2022 as compared to a 24% five-year Company average.
INCLUSION, DIVERSITY, EQUITY & ACCESS
 At AEO, we believe that our success is the result of our focus on being an inclusive, diverse, equitable and accessible Company. It is about more than simply bringing together people who are different; it is about celebrating what makes us REAL.
 We believe in embedding Inclusion, Diversity, Equity & Access (“IDEA”) into everything we do. Our mission is to achieve sustainable progress in the pillars of hiring, community, and development through strategic, data-supported, and people-centric action. Our values are at the center of every decision, product, and interaction. This means making sure that all people are respected and feel that being their authentic selves will not be a barrier to personal or professional fulfillment and growth.
 We are a global company with people from many different backgrounds. In the United States alone, as of January 28, 2023, approximately 44% of our associates self-identified as people of color (“POC”). Specifically, our United States population is approximately 55% White, 25% Hispanic, 10% Black, 4% Asian, 1% American Indian or Native Hawaiian, 4% two or more races or other, and 1% not reported. Globally, 79% of our associates self-identified as women.
 These numbers reflect a year-over-year increase of 1% in the representation of POC across the organization. These gains were achieved through increased rates of POC hiring in each of the Company’s business units (Corporate, Stores and Distribution Centers), with increases of 1% in all three business units.
 We have three IDEA Pillars. Hiring, Community and Development.
 Hiring. AEO believes that a diverse workforce makes us stronger as an organization. We are focused on increasing candidate diversity in our recruiting process through implementation and execution of policies, processes, practices and strategies focused on inclusion, equity, and accessibility.


Community. Our associates have the freedom to be themselves, uniquely helping to create a vibrant community. We believe that AEO is a place where our people are excited to come to work, believe in the work that they do, feel valued, and are appreciated for their contributions. At AEO we also know we not only have the power to touch lives within our Company but also can make a lasting impact in the communities in which we operate. We know that living our values of People, Innovation, Passion, Integrity and Teamwork will allow us to enrich our internal and external communities and sustain our inclusive culture.
 Development. We believe in the power of equipping our leaders and our associates with the necessary resources to create and maintain an inclusive workplace, while aiming to advance the careers of associates from historically marginalized groups.
 During Fiscal 2022, in addition to increasing the representation of POC throughout the organization, we believe that we made significant progress on our IDEA initiatives at AEO, including:
 •The announcement of our second class of 15 recipients of the Steven Davis Scholarship for Social Justice (renamed in honor of the late Steven Davis, a Director of the AEO Board who passed away in 2022). The scholarship program is supported by an investment of $5 million, providing annual full scholarships to 15 associates who are actively driving anti-racism, equality and social justice initiatives;
 •Continuing our commitment to using both qualitative and quantitative data to inform our strategies and priorities, we released an expanded IDEA survey capturing our entire — population and leveraged information gathered through mandatory inclusive workplace training programs developed by our training partner Emtrain. These efforts provide us with important data-points to measure future progress. 
 •Launching the Structured Hiring process which revamps candidate evaluation for corporate positions to provide a more thoughtful and standardized approach to hiring, leading to a more equitable, accessible and inclusive process.
 •Investing in relationships with both Historically Black Colleges and Universities and underrepresented group student organizations at Predominantly White Institutions resulting in increased diversity within our Internship and Teammate programs.
 •Becoming an original signatory to the Open to All Charter to Mitigate Racial Bias, meant to address the different experiences of BIPOC customers in retail establishments and the role bias or the perception of bias has on their shopping experiences and choices.
 •Expanding Close Knit, our internal co-mentoring program and PREP, our mentoring and retail enrichment program aimed at educating college students from historically marginalized groups about opportunities in retail, generally, and AEO specifically.
 •The introduction of a LGBTQAI+ associate guide and Transition support resources for transgender associates, developed by members of The Real Pride Network (AEO’s LGBTQAI+ employee resource group), IDEA Department and AEO Human Resources.
 
TOTAL REWARDS
 Our compensation programs are designed to attract and retain highly skilled, performance-oriented associates who live our brands and embody the spirit of authenticity and innovation we cultivate. We focus on delivering simple, straightforward compensation programs that our associates can easily understand. Ensuring that our teams are rewarded for delivering results is a key priority.
 We strive to make compensation decisions that are fair and equitable, consistently evaluating compensation through both an internal and external lens. We focus on internal pay equity and conduct regular benchmarking to ensure competitiveness to the external market.
 Our compensation programs are composed of three key elements:
 •Competitive base pay rates, which are aligned to specific roles and skills, local market rates, and relevant experience;


•Incentive bonuses for full-time associates, which are structured to deliver financial rewards for the delivery of monthly, quarterly, or annual results; and
 •Annual stock awards for over 450 leaders and key individual contributors throughout areas of the business, including the senior management team, which provide a commonality of interest between our leaders and shareholders.
 We recognize that benefits are highly personal, and we offer a broad suite of inclusive plans and programs to our workforce, understanding that their needs and priorities vary. Starting on their hire, re-hire, or promotion date, our full-time associates have access to a variety of medical, dental and vision plan offerings. In the United States, our largest market, we also offer the following benefits to our workforce:
 •All associates are eligible for the following benefits: comprehensive health and holistic well-being programs, supporting the physical, emotional, social and financial needs of our associates. Benefit programs include: robust well-being programs and incentives promoting an active and healthy lifestyle; mental health and meditation benefits; innovative student loan debt benefits; financial well-being tools and guidance; a gym/online fitness discount program; discounts on AEO merchandise; and a voluntary benefit and discount platform, offering competitive rates for auto insurance, home/renters insurance, legal services, identity theft services, pet insurance and more. Upon eligibility, associates can participate in AEO’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan and 401(k) plans.
 •Associates that are eligible for AEO’s medical insurance programs: Full-time associates, or part-time associates with an average of 30 hours or more (per ACA’s required initial or standard measurement period), are eligible to enroll in medical insurance on their hire or rehire date. Associate’s dependents are also eligible to enroll in AEO’s medical insurance programs including dependent child(ren), and same or opposite-sex spouses or domestic partners. Enhanced benefits offered with medical insurance include: primary care, behavioral and specialist visits via telehealth to ensure consistent access to convenient, high-quality, low-cost care; a wide selection of behavioral health programs to support mental health; generous fertility management benefits, adoption and surrogacy reimbursement for our associates who are focused on expanding their families; digital management programs for chronic conditions, smoking cessation and digital physical therapy; prescription drug savings programs; access to care navigators and claims advocacy; gender affirmation support programs; free to low-cost primary and specialist visits at four onsite health care centers; and
 •For all full-time associates: Up to 10 free, confidential in-person or telephonic sessions per issue through the Employee Assistance Program; paid time off; life insurance, short-term and long-term disability insurance; access to health coaches and lifestyle programs to assist with managing chronic conditions, nutrition, smoking cessation and weight loss; flexible spending accounts; benefits to support parents of children with disabilities; neurodiversity inclusion training and resources; mobile apps for fertility, menopause, maternity, and parenting; support for nursing mothers on business travel; paid parental and caregiver leave; and additional caregiver programs.
 
We recognize the importance of supporting AEO’s new parents and caregivers. During Fiscal 2022, AEO made significant enhancements to parental and caregiver benefits. Full-time associates, after only 30 days of employment, are eligible for up to eight weeks of paid parental leave upon becoming a new parent. In addition, AEO automatically enrolls full-time associates into employer-paid short-term disability benefits upon being hired, rehired or promoted into a full-time status. Full-time associates that qualify for benefits under the Family and Medical Leave Act are also provided with four weeks of paid caregiver leave, to take care of a child, spouse, domestic partner or parent dealing with a serious medical condition.
 As securing child care and backup care in the United States remains challenging, we made the decision to continue child care benefits that offer support to those working at home, on a waiting list for child care, or those needing backup care. These programs were also expanded to offer tutoring for grades K-12 and expanded resources to caregivers.
 HEALTH AND SAFETY
 The health and safety of our workforce and customers are critical to our culture and business. We continue to put our people first in our health and safety programs for our associates, customers, and partners. AEO's Health and Safety Management Program focuses on accident prevention, training, and response. Safety is a team effort; all levels of management have responsibilities and are held accountable to the standards set by the Company.


Our efforts are focused on reporting leading indicators, which allow us to be proactive in predicting and preventing accidents from occurring. We identify leading indicators by conducting observations of our associates working and correcting unsafe behaviors, through coaching, before an injury can occur. Our efforts are benchmarked and audited annually. The results of the audits are shared with the executive management team, and appropriate corrective measures are taken to correct any identified deficiencies.
 Creating a safe and secure environment allows our associates, customers, and partners to perform efficiently and confidently. We deploy state-of-the-art technology in screening personnel, vehicles, and the surrounding grounds. Some technology applications use artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced analytics to enhance awareness and provide early detection of security anomalies that deserve appropriate attention. Our layered approach to security, coupled with technology, training, and vigilance, ensures AEO, Inc. maintains an environment that is the safest place to work and shop.
 Throughout Fiscal 2022, we have maintained the comprehensive global store playbook to protect our associates and guests from the new variants of COVID-19 as we evolved to a less restrictive set of protocols to stay in step with the CDC guideline. With the need for sanitizers and disposable masks being reduced in our stores, distribution centers, and offices, we found other organizations that could benefit and made donations of 15 million disposable masks to our communities.
 Competition
 The global retail apparel industry is highly competitive both in stores and online. We compete with various local, national, and global apparel retailers, as well as the casual apparel and footwear departments of department stores and discount retailers, primarily on the basis of quality, fashion, service, selection, and price.

 Seasonality
 Historically, our operations have been seasonal, with a large portion of total net revenue and operating income occurring in the third and fourth fiscal quarters, reflecting increased demand during the back-to-school and year-end holiday selling seasons, respectively. Our quarterly results of operations also may fluctuate based upon such factors as the timing of certain holiday seasons, the number and timing of new store openings, the acceptability of seasonal merchandise offerings, the timing and level of markdowns, store closings and remodels, competitive factors, weather and general economic and political conditions.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors
Macroeconomic and Industry Risks
 Global economic conditions and the effect of economic pressures and other business factors on discretionary consumer spending and changes in consumer preferences have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 The uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world, including ours. Inflation and other macroeconomic pressures in the United States and the global economy such as rising interest rates, energy prices

and recession fears are creating a complex and challenging retail environment for us and our customers, and consumers may further reduce discretionary spending.
 If global economic and financial market conditions deteriorate, the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition:
 •The success of our operations is highly dependent on consumer spending, which can be negatively impacted by economic conditions as well as factors affecting disposable consumer income such as income taxes, payroll taxes, employment, consumer debt, interest rates, increases in energy costs and consumer confidence. During Fiscal 2022 interest rates and energy costs increased, and consumer confidence reached an all time low. Additionally, there are fears of a potential recession during Fiscal 2023. Any of these factors could lead to a decrease in consumer spending. Declines in consumer spending have and, in the future, may result in decreased demand for our products, increased inventories, lower revenues, higher discounts, pricing pressure and lower gross margins. 
 •We may be negatively impacted by changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending habits such as consumer behavior reallocating to non-retail discretionary consumer spending.
 •We may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates.
 •We conduct transactions in various currencies, which creates exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the United States dollar, in particular the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar. Continued volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies could have a significant impact on our reported operating results and financial condition.
 •Continued volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain (such as cotton) and related inflationary pressures could have a material adverse effect on our costs, gross margins and profitability.
 •If our suppliers or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing needed for their operations in the capital and credit markets, it may result in delays or non-delivery of our products.
 
In uncertain economic environments, we cannot predict whether or when such circumstances may improve or worsen, or what impact, if any, such circumstances could have on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.
 Our inability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and fashion trends and fluctuations in consumer demand in a timely manner could adversely impact our business and results of operations.
 The specialty retail apparel business fluctuates according to changes in the economy and consumer preferences and trends, which are dictated by fashion trends and season and may shift quickly. These fluctuations can materially impact our sales and gross margins and are exacerbated by the fact that merchandise is typically ordered well in advance of a selling season. While we work to identify trends and consumer preferences on an ongoing basis and offer inventory and shopping experiences that meet such trends and preferences, we may not do so effectively and/or on a timely basis. As a result, we are vulnerable to changes in consumer demand, pricing shifts and the timing and selection of merchandise purchases.
Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to identify and respond to fashion trends and changing consumer preferences in a timely manner. Lead times for many of our design and purchasing decisions may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing apparel trends or consumer acceptance of our products. Our failure to enter into agreements for the manufacture and purchase of merchandise in a timely manner could, among other things, lead to a shortage of inventory and lower sales. Changes in fashion trends, if unsuccessfully identified, forecasted or responded to markdowns or write-offs, could negatively impact our ability to achieve or maintain profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business, particularly unanticipated changes such as those that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic, could also negatively impact our brand image with our customers and result in diminished brand loyalty.
Seasonality may cause sales to fluctuate and negatively impact our results of operations.
 
Historically, our operations have been seasonal, with a large portion of total net revenue and operating income occurring in the third and fourth fiscal quarters, reflecting increased demand during the back-to-school and year-end holiday selling seasons, respectively. Because of this seasonality, factors negatively affecting us during the third and fourth fiscal quarters of any year, including adverse weather or unfavorable economic conditions, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for the entire year. As a result, we may not be able to accurately predict our

quarterly sales. Accordingly, our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period. Our quarterly results of operations also may fluctuate based upon such factors as the timing of certain holiday seasons, the number and timing of new store openings, the acceptability of seasonal merchandise offerings, the timing and level of markdowns, store closings and remodels, competitive factors, weather, and general economic and political conditions.
 
This seasonality, along with other factors that are beyond our control, including public health events, social or political unrest, general economic conditions, changes in consumer preferences, weather conditions, including the effects of climate change, the availability of import quotas, transportation disruptions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate.
 We operate in a highly competitive industry, and we face significant pricing pressures from existing and new competitors.
 
The sale of apparel, accessories, intimates, and personal care products is a highly competitive business with numerous participants, including individual and chain specialty apparel retailers, local, regional, national, and international department stores; discount stores and online businesses. Changing consumer preferences has resulted and may continue to result in new competition for our products. The substantial sales growth in the digital channel within the last several years has increased competition due to new entrants in the market and has resulted in pricing pressures from new entrants and established competitors. Some of these competitors have robust digital consumer experiences and highly efficient delivery systems. Furthermore, the decrease in mall traffic is putting a greater reliance on the digital channel and thus increasing the competitive threat.
 
We face a variety of competitive challenges, including:
 •Anticipating and quickly responding to changing consumer demands or preferences better than our competitors;
 •Maintaining favorable brand recognition and effective marketing of our products to consumers in several demographic markets;
 •Sourcing merchandise efficiently;
 •Developing innovative, high-quality merchandise in styles that appeal to our customers and in ways that favorably distinguish us from our competitors;
 •Countering the aggressive pricing and promotional activities of many of our competitors; and
 •Anticipating and quickly responding to changing consumer shopping preferences and practices, including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement, social media communication, and online shopping.
 
In light of the competitive challenges we face, we may not be able to compete successfully in the future, which may result in lower market share. Additionally, increases in the number of our competitors could reduce our sales, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
 Our results could be adversely affected by events beyond our control, such as natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, negative global climate patterns, or other catastrophic events.

Our operations, those of our licensees, our suppliers, or our customers, could be negatively impacted by various events beyond our control, including, without limitation, natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, extreme cold events and other adverse weather conditions; public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics (including, without limitation, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic); political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war, labor unrest, and other political instability (including, without limitation, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine); negative global climate patterns, especially in water-stressed regions; or other catastrophic events, such as fires or other disasters occurring at our distribution centers or our vendors' manufacturing facilities, whether occurring in the United States or internationally. In particular, these types of events could impact our supply chain from or to the impacted region and could impact our ability or the ability of our licensees or other third parties to operate our stores or websites, or could impact our business as a whole if the impacted region includes our corporate offices. In addition, these types of events could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions or, depending upon the severity, globally. Disasters occurring at our vendors’ manufacturing facilities could impact our reputation and consumers’ perception of our brands. To the extent that any of these events occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected. In addition, the impacts of climate change could result in changes in regulations or consumer preferences, which could in turn affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.



Impairment to goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets could adversely impact our profitability.
 
Significant negative industry or general economic trends, changes in customer demand for our product, disruptions to our business, and unexpected significant changes or planned changes in our operating results or use of long-lived assets may result in impairments to goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets.
 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
 The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains, created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets, and has had an adverse impact on our business and financial performance. The COVID-19 pandemic also has impacted and may in the future interrupt and further increase costs for our supply chain and could require additional changes to our operations.
 
Transportation shortages, labor shortages and port congestion globally have in the past delayed and could in the future delay inventory orders and, in turn, deliveries to our customers and availability in our company-operated stores and e-commerce sites. These supply chain and logistics disruptions have impacted our inventory levels and net revenues in prior periods and could impact our financial results in future periods.
 The COVID-19 pandemic also directly threatens the health of our associates and consumers. The operation of all of our stores is critically dependent on our associates who staff these locations. In the event that an associate tests positive for COVID-19, we have had to, and may in the future have to, temporarily close one or more stores, offices or distribution centers for cleaning and/or quarantine one or more associates, or due to the unavailability of impacted associates, which could negatively impact our financial results.
 The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business will depend on future developments, which remain highly uncertain and difficult to predict, including the duration, severity and sustained geographic spread of the pandemic; additional waves of increased infections; the virulence and spread of different strains of the virus; and the extent to which associated prevention, containment, remediation and treatment efforts, including global vaccination programs and vaccine acceptance, are successful.
 Strategic Risks
 Our inability to grow our digital channels and leverage omni-channel capabilities could adversely impact our business.
 
We have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in building our technologies and digital capabilities in three key areas: mobile technology, digital marketing, and the digital customer experience. We have made significant capital investments in these areas but there is no assurance that we will realize expected returns on those investments or be successful in growing our digital channels.

As omni-channel retailing continues to evolve, our customers are increasingly more likely to shop across multiple channels that work in tandem to meet their needs. In addition, our competitors are also investing in omni-channel initiatives, some of which may be more successful than our initiatives. Our inability to respond to changes in consumer behavior and our competitive environment, or to successfully maintain and expand our omni-channel business may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. See “— Operational Risks — Our failure to manage growth in our omni-channel operations and the resulting impact on our distribution and fulfillment networks may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.”
 Failure to define, launch and communicate a brand-relevant customer experience could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability.
 
We strive to build strong emotional connections with our customers and to enrich the customer experience. If our marketing and customer experience programs, including our loyalty program, are unsuccessful, or if our competitors are more effective with their programs than we are, our growth and profitability may be negatively affected.


Our efforts to execute on our key business priorities could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability.
 Our success depends on our ability to execute on our key priorities. Achieving these key business priorities depends on us executing our strategies successfully, and the initiatives that we implement in connection with these goals may not resonate with our customers, or be successful in achieving their intended goals. It may take longer than anticipated to generate the expected benefits of our initiatives, and there can be no guarantee that pursuing these key priorities will result in improved operating results or achievement of a given priority. Misalignment and competing initiatives could result in inefficiencies, erroneously prioritized efforts, and resource dilution. Failure to implement our key business priorities successfully could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability.
 Our current international operations and efforts to further expand internationally expose us to risks inherent in operating in other countries.
 
We are actively pursuing additional international expansion initiatives, which include Company-owned stores and stores operated by third parties through licensing arrangements in select international markets. The effect of international expansion arrangements on our business and results of operations is uncertain and will depend upon various factors, including the demand for our products in new markets internationally. Furthermore, although we provide store operation training, literature and support, to the extent that a licensee does not operate its stores in a manner consistent with our requirements regarding our brand and customer experience standards, our business results and the value of our brand could be negatively impacted.
 
As we pursue our international expansion initiatives, we are subject to certain laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as the laws of the foreign countries in which we operate, which may impose new or changing regulatory restrictions and requirements, including in the areas of data privacy, sustainability and responses to climate change. Violations of these laws could subject us to sanctions or other penalties that could have an adverse effect on our reputation, operating results and financial condition.
 
A failure to implement our expansion initiatives properly, or the adverse impact of political or economic risks in our current or new international markets, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In certain international markets we have limited prior experience operating our Company-owned stores, and in all international markets we face established local and international competitors. In many of these locations, the real estate, labor and employment, transportation and logistics and other operating requirements differ dramatically from those in the locations where we have more experience. Consumer demand and behavior, as well as tastes and purchasing trends, may differ substantially, and, as a result, sales of our products may not be successful, or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate. Our potential inability to anticipate and address differences that we encounter as we expand internationally may divert financial, operational, and managerial resources from our existing operations, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are increasingly exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our revenue, profits, assets, and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar. The instruments we may use to hedge certain foreign currency risks in the future may not succeed in offsetting all of the negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations.
 Operational Risks
 Our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brands.
 
Our business depends on the value and reputation of our brands and our ability to anticipate, identify, and respond to consumer demands and preferences, and to fashion trends. In addition, the increasing use of social media platforms allows for rapid communication and any negative publicity related to the aforementioned concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise. Public perception about our products or our stores, whether justified or not, could impair our reputation, involve us in litigation, damage our brands and may adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
 
The appeal of our brands may also depend on the success of our environmental, social and governance ("ESG") initiatives, which require company-wide coordination and alignment. We are working to manage risks and costs to us, our licensees and our supply chain that are exposed to the effects of climate change as well as diminishing fossil fuel and water resources. These risks include any increased public focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, on climate change and other environmental sustainability matters, including packaging and waste, animal welfare, and land use. We may receive increased pressure to expand our disclosures in these areas, make commitments, set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them, which could expose us to market, operational and execution costs or risks. The metrics we disclose in our ESG report, such as emissions and water usage, whether they be based on the standards

we set for ourselves or those set by others, may influence our reputation and the value of our brand. Our failure to achieve progress on our metrics on a timely basis, or at all, could adversely affect our business, financial performance, and growth. By electing to publicly set and share these metrics and expand upon our disclosures, we may also face increased scrutiny related to ESG activities. As a result, we could experience damage to our reputation and the value of our brands if we fail to act responsibly in the areas in which we report. Any such harm to our reputation or any failure or perceived failure by us to adequately address ESG-related activities, including setting of metrics or enhancing disclosures, could adversely affect our business, financial performance, and growth.
 Our failure to manage growth in our omni-channel operations and the resulting impact on our distribution and fulfillment networks may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
 
Increasingly, consumers are using mobile-based devices and applications to shop online with us and with our competitors, and to do comparison shopping, as well as to engage with us and our competitors through digital services and experiences that are offered on mobile platforms. In Fiscal 2022, digital sales represented 36% of our total revenue. In order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to continue to adapt to future changes in technology to address the changing demands of consumers. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, effective, reliable, secure, user-friendly digital commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers or any failure to provide attractive digital experiences to our customers could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of digital commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with consumers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our digital commerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
 
Our omni-channel operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results. Risks include, but are not limited to, the difficulty in recreating the in-store experience; our ability to anticipate and implement innovations in technology and logistics in order to appeal to existing and potential consumers who increasingly rely on multiple channels to meet their shopping needs; and the failure of and risks related to the systems that operate our web infrastructure, websites and the related support systems, including computer viruses, theft of consumer information, privacy concerns, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions.
 
Our failure to maintain efficient and uninterrupted fulfillment operations could also have a material adverse effect on our results. The satisfaction of consumers who shop online depends on their timely receipt of merchandise. If we encounter difficulties with our distribution facilities, or if the facilities were to shut down for any reason, including as a result of fire, natural disaster or work stoppage, we could face shortages of inventory, incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to consumers, and cause consumer dissatisfaction. Any of these issues could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and cash flows.
 Our inability to implement and sustain adequate information technology systems could adversely impact our profitability and the loss of disruption of information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Our information technology systems are an integral part of our strategies in efficiently operating our business, in managing operations and protecting against security risks related to our electronic processing and transmitting of confidential consumer and associate data. The requirements to keep our information technology systems operating at peak performance may be higher than anticipated and could strain our capital resources, management of any system upgrades, implementation of new systems and the related change management processes required with new systems and our ability to prevent any future information security breaches. We regularly evaluate our information technology systems and are currently implementing modifications and/or upgrades to the information technology systems that support our business. Modifications include replacing legacy systems with successor systems, making changes to legacy systems, or acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of the inherent risks associated with operating, replacing, and modifying these systems, including inaccurate system information and system disruptions. There is a risk that information technology system disruptions and inaccurate system information, if not anticipated and/or promptly and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, there can be no guarantee that, if any information technology system failure, cyberattack, or security breach occurs, it will be timely detected or sufficiently remediated.

Any significant disruption of our data center could have a material adverse effect on those operations dependent on those systems, specifically our store and e-commerce operations, our distribution and fulfillment centers and our merchandising team. While we maintain business interruption and property insurance, in the event of a data center shutdown, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover the impact to the business.
 

Furthermore, if our information technology systems are damaged, breached or cease to properly function for any reason, including the poor performance of, failure of, or cyber-attack on third-party service providers, catastrophic events, power outages, cybersecurity breaches, network outages, failed upgrades or similar events, and if our disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct business, as well as reputational harm, and we may be subject to governmental investigations and litigation, any of which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
 We face risks related to our electronic processing of sensitive and confidential personal and business data. If such data are lost or disclosed in an unauthorized manner, or if we or our third-party vendors are subject to cyberattacks, data breaches, other security incidents, or disruption of information technology systems or software, such events could expose us to liability, damage our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Given the nature of our business, we, together with third parties acting on our behalf, receive, collect, process, use, and retain sensitive and confidential consumer and associate data, in addition to proprietary business information. Our business relies on information technology networks and systems to market and sell our products, process financial and personal information, manage a variety of business processes and comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. We also depend on a variety of information systems to effectively process consumer orders and other data and for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our associates, consumers, prospective consumers, and vendors. Some of our third-party service providers, such as identity verification and payment processing providers, also regularly have access to consumer data. Additionally, we maintain other confidential, proprietary, or otherwise sensitive information relating to our business and from third parties.

The information technology networks and systems owned, operated, controlled or used by us or our vendors may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns, software or hardware vulnerabilities, data breaches, security incidents, supply-side attacks, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components, power outages, natural disasters, hardware failures, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, user malfeasance, computer viruses, unauthorized access, phishing or social engineering attacks, ransomware attacks, denial-of-service attacks and other real or perceived cyber-attacks or catastrophic events, all of which may not be prevented by our efforts to secure our information technology systems. Any of these incidents could lead to interruptions or shutdowns of our platform, disruptions in our ability to process consumer orders or to track, record or analyze the sale of our products, loss or corruption of data or unauthorized access to or acquisition of personal information or other sensitive information, such as our intellectual property.

We utilize security tools and controls and also rely on our third-party vendors to use sufficient security measures, including encryption and authentication technology, in an effort to protect personal and other sensitive information. However, advances in information technology capabilities, increasingly sophisticated tools and methods used by hackers and cyber terrorists, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in our failure or inability, or the failure or inability of our vendors, to adequately protect personal or other sensitive information and there can be no assurance that we or our vendors will not suffer a cyberattack, that hackers or other unauthorized parties will not gain access to or exfiltrate personal information or other sensitive data, or that any such data compromise or unauthorized access will be discovered in a timely fashion.

We rely on associates, contractors and other third parties who may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train associates, pay higher insurance premiums, and engage third-party specialists for additional services. An information security breach involving confidential and personal data could damage our reputation and our customers' willingness to purchase from us. In addition, we may incur material liabilities and remediation costs as a result of an information security breach, including potential liability for stolen consumer or associate data, repairing system damage or providing credit monitoring or other benefits to consumers or associates affected by the breach. In the event we experience an information security breach, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover the impact to the business. Although we have developed mitigating security controls to reduce our cyber risk and protect our data from loss or disclosure due to a security breach, including processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor, such measures cannot provide absolute security.
 
We and our third-party vendors regularly experience cyber-attacks aimed at disrupting services. Our third-party vendors have been and may be the victim of cyber related attacks that could lead to operational disruptions that could have an adverse effect on our ability to fulfill consumer orders. Security incidents such as ransomware attacks are becoming increasingly prevalent and severe, as well as increasingly difficult to detect. We, and our third-party vendors, have been

subject to cyber, phishing and social engineering attacks and other security incidents in the past and may continue to be subject to such attacks in the future. Security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent actions by our associates, our third-party vendors or their personnel or other parties. If we or our third-party service providers experience security breaches that result in marketplace performance problems, availability problems, or the loss, corruption of, unauthorized access to, or disclosure of personal data or confidential information, people may become unwilling to provide us the information necessary to make purchases on our sites, and our reputation and market position could be harmed. Existing consumers may also decrease their purchases or close their accounts altogether. We could also face potential claims, investigations, regulatory proceedings, liability and litigation, and bear other substantial costs in connection with remediating and otherwise responding to any data security breach, all of which may not be adequately covered by insurance, and which may result in an increase in our costs for insurance or insurance not being available to us on economically feasible terms, or at all. Insurers may also deny us coverage as to any future claim. Any of these results could harm our growth prospects, financial condition, business, and reputation.
 Telework may negatively impact our operations or increase our risk exposures.
 
Most of our corporate office associates are working remotely. If our associates are unable to work because of ineffective remote work arrangements or technology failures or limitations, our operations would be adversely impacted. Further, remote work arrangements may increase the risk of security incidents, data breaches or cyberattacks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, due to, among other things, the loss of proprietary data, interruptions or delays in the operation of our business, damage to our reputation and any government-imposed penalty.
 Our international merchandise sourcing strategy subjects us to risks that could adversely impact our business and results of operations.
 
We design our merchandise, which is manufactured by third-party suppliers worldwide. Because we have a global supply chain, any event that causes the disruption of imports, including the insolvency of a significant supplier, global health crisis, or a major labor dispute including any such actions involving ports, trans loaders, consolidators, or shippers, could have an adverse effect on our operations. Given the volatility and risk in the current markets, our reliance on external vendors leaves us subject to certain risks should one or more of these external vendors become insolvent. The financial failure of a key vendor could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.
 
Trade matters may disrupt our supply chain. Trade restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions against apparel items, as well as United States or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages, or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of apparel available to us and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We have a Supplier Code of Conduct that provides guidelines for our vendors regarding working conditions, employment practices, and compliance with local laws. A copy of the Supplier Code of Conduct is posted on our website, www.aeo-inc.com, and is included in our vendor manual in English and multiple other languages. There can be no assurance that all violations can be eliminated in our supply chain. Publicity regarding violation of our Supplier Code of Conduct or other social responsibility standards by any of our vendor factories could adversely affect our reputation, sales, and financial performance.
 
There is a risk of terrorist activity on a global basis. Such activity might take the form of a physical act that impedes the flow of imported goods or the insertion of a harmful or injurious agent into an imported shipment. We cannot predict the likelihood of any such activities or the extent of their adverse impact on our operations.
 
We are also exposed to risks caused by new or ongoing armed conflicts. For example, the recent conflict between Russia and Ukraine has caused and continues to cause disruption, instability and volatility in global markets. The conflict has caused and may continue to cause adverse global economic conditions resulting from escalating geopolitical tensions and inflationary pressures, among other factors.
 Our product costs may be adversely affected by foreign trade issues, including import tariffs and other trade restrictions with China, increasing prices for raw materials, political instability, or other reasons, which could impact our profitability.
 
A significant portion of the products that we purchase is manufactured abroad. Foreign imports subject us to risks relating to changes in import duties, quotas, the introduction of United States taxes on imported goods or the extension of United

States income taxes on our foreign suppliers' sales of imported goods through the adoption of destination-based income tax jurisdiction, loss of "most favored nation" status with the United States, shipment delays and shipping port constraints, labor strikes, work stoppages or other disruptions, freight cost increases and economic uncertainties. Furthermore, we could face significantly higher United States income and similar taxes with respect to sales of products purchased from foreign suppliers if the United States were to adopt a system of taxation, such as a border adjustment tax, under which the cost of imported products was not deductible in determining such products' tax base. If such a tax system were adopted, we could also face higher prices for products manufactured or produced abroad that we purchase from our domestic suppliers if they were subject to such a tax.
 
In addition, the United States government periodically considers other restrictions on the importation of products obtained by our vendors and us. General trade tensions between the United States and China have been high, with multiple rounds of United States tariffs on Chinese goods implemented in 2018 and 2019. Furthermore, China or other countries have and may institute future retaliatory trade measures in response to existing or future tariffs imposed by the United States that could have a negative impact on our business. If any of these events continue as described, we may need to seek alternative suppliers or vendors, raise prices, or make changes to our operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability, results of operations and financial condition. If any of these or other factors were to cause a disruption of trade from the countries in which our vendors' suppliers or our products' manufacturers are located, our inventory levels may be reduced or the cost of our products may increase.
 Our suppliers may be impacted by economic conditions and cycles and changing laws and regulatory requirements that could impact their ability to do business with us or cause us to terminate our relationship with them and require us to find replacements, which we may have difficulty doing.
 
Our suppliers are subject to the fluctuations in general economic cycles, and global economic conditions may impact their ability to operate their businesses. They may also be impacted by the increasing costs or availability of raw materials due to inflationary pressures or rising labor and distribution costs, among other reasons, potentially resulting in demands for less attractive contract terms or an inability for them to meet our requirements or conduct their own businesses. The performance and financial condition of a supplier may cause us to alter our business terms or to cease doing business with a particular supplier, or change our sourcing practices generally, which could in turn adversely affect our business and financial condition.
 
In addition, we require our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety, anti-corruption, human rights, and environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our Vendor Code of Conduct and other industry standards. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who uphold our standards and provide access to products in a timely and efficient manner in the volume we may demand, can present a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the United States Further, United States foreign trade policies, tariffs, and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries and entities, the limitation on the importation of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control.
Our inability to achieve planned store performance, gain market share in the face of declining shopping center traffic or attract customers to our stores could adversely impact our profitability and our results of operations.
 
The results achieved by our stores may not be indicative of long-term performance or the potential performance of stores in other locations. Part of our future growth is dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return. We cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs. The failure of our stores to achieve acceptable results could result in store asset impairment charges, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
 
Additionally, our real estate strategy may not be successful, and store locations may fail to produce desired results, which could impact our competitive position and profitability. Customer shopping patterns have been evolving from brick-and-mortar locations to, increasingly, digital channels. We have Company-owned stores in shopping centers that have experienced declining traffic trends while our digital channels continue to grow. Our ability to grow revenue and acquire new customers is contingent on our ability to drive traffic to both store locations and digital channels so that we are accessible to our customers when and where they want to shop.
 
We seek to locate our brick-and-mortar stores in prominent locations within successful shopping malls or street locations. Our stores benefit from the ability of the malls’ “anchor” tenants, which generally are large department stores and other area attractions, to generate consumer traffic near our stores. We cannot control the increasing impact of digital channels on

shopping center traffic, the loss of an anchor or other significant tenant in a shopping mall in which we have a store, the development of new shopping malls in the United States or around the world, the availability or cost of appropriate locations, competition with other retailers for prominent locations, or the success of individual shopping malls. All of these factors may impact our ability to meet our sales targets and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. In addition, some malls and shopping centers that were in prominent locations when we opened our stores may cease to be viewed as prominent. If this trend away from brick-and-mortar retail continues or if the popularity of mall shopping continues to decline generally among our customers, our sales may decline, which would impact our results of operations and financial condition.
 Failure to properly manage and allocate our inventory could have an adverse effect on our business, sales, margins, financial condition, and results of operations
 
In order to better serve our customers and maximize sales, we must properly execute our inventory management strategies by appropriately allocating merchandise among our stores, timely and efficiently distributing inventory to such locations, maintaining an appropriate mix and level of inventory in such locations, and effectively managing pricing and markdowns, and there is no assurance we will be able to do so. In addition, as we continue to take actions to right-size our inventory, there could be disruptions in inventory flow and placement. Failure to effectively execute our inventory management strategies could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 We base our purchases of inventory, in part, on our sales forecasts. If our sales forecasts do not match customer demand, we may experience higher inventory levels and need to markdown excess or slow-moving inventory, leading to decreased profit margins, or we may have insufficient inventory to meet customer demand, leading to lost sales, either of which could adversely affect our financial performance.
 

We have significant lease obligations and are subject to risks associated with leasing substantial amounts of space, including future increases in occupancy costs and the need to generate significant cash flow to meet our lease obligations.
 
Operating lease obligations, which consist primarily of future minimum lease commitments related to store operating leases, represent a significant contractual commitment. All of our stores are leased and generally have initial terms of 5-10 years. In the future, we may not be able to negotiate favorable lease terms for the most desired store locations. Our inability to do so may cause our occupancy costs to be higher in future years or may force us to close stores in desirable locations.
 
Certain leases have early termination options, which can be exercised under certain specific conditions. In addition to future minimum lease payments, some of our store leases provide for additional rental payments based on a percentage of net sales, or “percentage rent,” if sales at the respective stores exceed specified levels, as well as the payment of tenant occupancy costs, including maintenance costs, common area charges, real estate taxes and certain other expenses. Many of our lease agreements have defined escalating rent provisions over the initial term and any extensions.
 
We depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease expenses. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to fund these expenses, due to continued decreases in mall traffic, the highly competitive and promotional retail environment, or other factors, we may not be able to service our lease expenses, or may need to incur additional indebtedness, which could materially harm our business. Furthermore, the significant cash flow required to satisfy our obligations under the leases increases our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry, and competitive conditions, and could limit our ability to fund working capital, incur indebtedness, and make capital expenditures or other investments in our business.
 Our inability to successfully integrate Quiet Logistics’ business and operations may adversely affect the combined company’s future results.

We believe the acquisition of Quiet Logistics will result in certain anticipated benefits, including inventory efficiencies, affordable same-day and next-day delivery options, and other cost-effective in-market fulfillment services for the Company by utilizing state-of-the-art technology and robotics. The combined company may fail to realize these anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons, including the following:
•failure to successfully manage relationships with employees, distributors and suppliers;
 •revenue attrition in excess of anticipated levels;
 •potential incompatibility of technologies and systems;


•failure to leverage the increased scale of the combined company quickly and effectively;
 •potential difficulties integrating and harmonizing financial reporting systems;
 •the loss of key employees; and
 •failure to effectively coordinate sales and marketing efforts to efficiently utilize the acquired capabilities.
 
The ongoing integration of Quiet Logistics may experience additional and unforeseen expenses or delays. If the combined company is not able to successfully leverage Quiet Logistics’ business and operations, these anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. Additionally, if these benefits do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the market price of our common stock may decline.
 The integration of Quiet Logistics may result in significant accounting charges that adversely affect the results of the combined company.

The financial results of the combined company may be adversely affected by cash expenses and non-cash accounting charges incurred in connection with the combination. In addition to the anticipated cash charges, non-cash costs associated with the amortization of intangible assets are expected. The failure of Quiet Logistics to achieve acceptable financial results could result in impairment charges, which could materially affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
 We rely on key personnel, the loss of whom could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Our success depends to a significant extent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified key personnel, including senior management, and, in particular, Jay Schottenstein, our Executive Chairman and CEO as well as Jennifer Foyle, our Chief Creative Officer. Collective or individual changes in our senior management and other key personnel could have an adverse effect on our ability to determine and execute our strategies, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. There is a high level of competition for senior management and other key personnel, and we cannot be assured we will be able to attract, retain, and develop a sufficient number of qualified senior managers and other key personnel.
 
We must also attract, develop, and retain a sufficient number of qualified field and distribution center personnel. Competition for talent is intense and the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation, and overtime regulations. If we are unable to retain, attract, and motivate talented employees with the appropriate skill sets, or if changes to our organizational structure, operating results, or business model adversely affect morale or retention, we may not achieve our objectives and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. In addition, the loss of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to effectively identify a suitable successor to a key role could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 Increases in labor costs, including wages, could adversely impact our operational results, financial condition and results of operations
 
Our store and distribution center operations are subject to laws governing such matters as minimum wages, working conditions and overtime pay. As minimum wage rates increase or related laws and regulations change, we may need to increase not only the wage rates of our minimum wage employees, but also the wages paid to our other hourly or salaried employees. Any increase in the cost of our labor could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we operate in a competitive labor market, in which wage actions by other retailers and companies may require us to increase salary and wage rates, bonuses and other incentives in order to attract and retain talented employees across all of our retail store, distribution and fulfillment center, and home office operations. Labor shortages and increased employee turnover could also increase our labor costs. This in turn could lead us to increase prices, which could adversely impact our sales. We are also subject to risks related to other store and distribution center expenses and operational costs. Conversely, if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices, our profitability may decline.


We cannot provide assurance that we will pay dividends, or if paid, that dividend payments will be consistent with historical levels.
 
We have generally paid quarterly dividends, which are funded through cash flow from operations and available cash on hand. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board and is limited by applicable state law concepts of available funds for distribution, as well as contractual restrictions. As a result, the amount, if any, of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon a number of factors, including our available cash on hand, anticipated cash needs, overall financial condition, any future contractual restrictions, future prospects for earnings and cash flows, as well as other factors considered relevant by our Board. In addition, our Board may also suspend the payment of dividends at any time if it deems such action to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. For example, our Board suspended our quarterly dividend during the second quarter of Fiscal 2022 to support financial flexibility while we navigated the changing macroeconomic environment.
 
There can be no assurance that the Company will pay dividends in the future on a regular basis or otherwise. In the event our financial condition or other factors necessitate, our board may choose to delay or suspend the payment of our dividends again in the future.
 Legal, Tax, and Regulatory Risks
 We are subject to stringent and changing privacy laws, regulations, and standards as well as policies, contracts, and other obligations related to data privacy and security. Our failure to comply with privacy laws and regulations, as well as other legal obligations, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
State, federal, and foreign governments are increasingly enacting laws and regulations governing the collection, use, retention, sharing, transfer, and security of personally identifiable information and data. A variety of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, orders, rules, codes, regulatory guidance and certain industry standards regarding privacy, data protection, consumer protection, information security and the processing of personal information and other data apply to our business. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("CCPA"), which took effect on January 1, 2020, imposes certain restrictions and disclosure obligations on businesses that collect personal information about California residents and provides for a private right of action, as well as penalties for non-compliance. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations and creates a private right of action for certain data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. It remains unclear how various provisions of the CCPA will be interpreted and enforced. The California Privacy Rights Act ("CPRA"), which took effect on January 1, 2023 (with a look-back for certain requirements to January 2022), amends and expands the CCPA and places additional restrictions on the "sharing" of personal information for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising. We are and may be subject to additional privacy regulations in the future, including the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, which took effect on January 1, 2023, and the Colorado Privacy Act, which will take effect on July 1, 2023, both of which regulate the processing of "personal data" regarding their respective residents and grant residents certain rights with respect to their personal data. State laws are changing rapidly, and new legislation proposed or enacted in a number of other states imposes, or has the potential to impose, additional obligations on companies that process confidential, sensitive and personal information, and will continue to shape the data privacy environment nationally. The United States federal government is also significantly focused on privacy matters.

We are subject to other consumer protection laws, including California's Consumer Legal Remedies Act and unfair competition and false advertising laws, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, Canada's Anti-Spam Law, the CCPA, the CPRA and other recently enacted consumer data protection laws. Additionally, the regulatory environment is increasingly demanding with frequent new and changing requirements concerning cybersecurity, information security and privacy, which may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Any failure by us or any of our business partners to comply with applicable laws, rules, and regulations may result in investigations or actions against us by governmental entities, private claims and litigation, fines, penalties or other liabilities. Such events may increase our expenses, expose us to liabilities and impair our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
While we aim to comply with applicable data protection laws and obligations in all material respects, there is no assurance that we will not be subject to claims that we have violated such laws and obligations, will be able to successfully defend against such claims, or will not be subject to significant fines and penalties in the event of non-compliance. Additionally, to the extent that multiple state-level laws are introduced with inconsistent or conflicting standards and there is no federal law to preempt such laws, compliance with such laws could be difficult and costly to achieve, or impossible to achieve, and we could be subject to fines and penalties in the event of non-compliance.



The Company’s amended and restated bylaws (“Bylaws”) provide, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for certain legal actions between the Company and its stockholders, which could increase costs to bring a claim, discourage claims or limit the ability of the Company’s stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum viewed by the stockholders as more favorable for disputes with the Company or the Company’s directors, officers or other employees.
 
Our Bylaws provide, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for any (i) derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company; (ii) action asserting a claim for or based on a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director or officer or other employee or agent of the Company to the Company or the Company’s stockholders, including a claim alleging the aiding and abetting of such a breach of fiduciary duty; (iii) action asserting a claim against the Company or any current or former director or officer or other employee or agent of the Company arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”), or the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws; (iv) action asserting a claim related to or involving the Company or any current or former director or officer or other employee or agent of the Company that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of Delaware or (v) action asserting an “internal corporate claim,” as that term is defined in Section 115 of the DGCL shall, in each case, be the Delaware Court of Chancery located within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery located within the State of Delaware lacks jurisdiction over any such action or proceeding, the sole and exclusive forum for such action or proceeding shall be another state or federal court located within the State of Delaware). Additionally, our Bylaws provide that unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. The choice of forum provisions may increase costs to bring a claim, discourage claims or limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or the Company’s directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company or the Company’s directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice-of- forum provisions contained in the Company’s Bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, the Company may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions. The exclusive forum provisions in the Company’s Bylaws will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under the federal securities laws including the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as amended, or the respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
 We may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights.

We believe that our trademarks and service marks, as described in Part I, Item 1, Business, are important to our success and our competitive position due to their name recognition with our customers. We devote substantial resources to establishing and protecting our trademarks and service marks. We are not aware of any material claims of infringement or material challenges to our right to use any of our trademarks. Nevertheless, the actions we have taken, including to establish and protect our trademarks and service marks, may not be adequate to prevent others from imitating our products or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products. Other parties may also claim that some of our products infringe on their trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States Litigation regarding our trademarks and other intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 Changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
 
We are subject to numerous domestic and foreign laws and regulations affecting our business, including those related to labor, employment, worker health and safety, competition, privacy, consumer protection, import/export, anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and climate change. Additional legal and regulatory requirements have increased the complexity of the regulatory environment and the cost of compliance. Laws and regulations at the local, state, federal, and international levels frequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated. In addition, we cannot predict the impact that may result from changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape. If these laws change without our knowledge, or are violated by importers, designers, manufacturers, distributors or employees, we could experience delays in shipments or receipt of goods or be subject to fines or other penalties, any of which could adversely affect our business. Also, changes in laws and regulations could make operating our business more expensive

or require us to change the way we do business. Our employees, contractors, vendors and suppliers could take actions that violate our policies and procedures which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our financial condition and the market price of our common stock.
Fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate could adversely affect us.
 
We are subject to income taxes in many United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. We record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which include reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions. At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing authorities. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. In addition, the tax laws and regulations in the countries where we operate may change or there may be changes in interpretation and enforcement of existing tax laws. As a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated. Our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings by jurisdiction or by changes to existing accounting rules or regulations.
 The unfavorable outcome of pending or future litigation could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 
From time to time, we are party to several legal proceedings arising out of various aspects of our business. The outcome of these proceedings may not be favorable, and one or more unfavorable outcomes could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
General Risk Factors
 Additionally, other factors could adversely affect our financial performance, including factors such as our ability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses; any interruption of our key infrastructure systems, including exceeding capacity in our distribution centers; any disaster or casualty resulting in the interruption of service from our distribution centers or in a large number of our stores; any interruption of our business related to an outbreak of a pandemic disease in a country where we source or market our merchandise; extreme weather conditions or changes in climate conditions or weather patterns; and the effects of changes in interest rates.
 The impact of any of the previously discussed factors, some of which are beyond our control, and others which we are not aware of or which we do not currently consider material, may cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations expressed elsewhere in this Form 10-K and other forward-looking statements we may make from time to time.
