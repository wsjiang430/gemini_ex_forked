ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 Global Crossing Airlines Group Inc. (“GlobalX” or the “Company”) operates a US Part 121 domestic flag and supplemental airline using the Airbus A320 family of aircraft (“A320”). GlobalX’s business model is to (1) provide services on an Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance and Insurance (“ACMI”) using wet lease contracts to airlines and non-airlines, and (2) on a Full Service (“Charter”) basis whereby we provide passenger aircraft charter services to customers by charging an “all-in” fee that includes fuel, insurance, landing fees, navigation fees and most other operational fees and costs. GlobalX operates within the United States, Europe, Canada, Central and South America. GlobalX began operating the Airbus A321 freighter (“A321F”) during the first quarter of 2023 after completing all FAA certification requirements with the A321F.
The Company was originally incorporated in British Columbia, Canada on September 2, 1966 under the name Shasta Mines & Oil Ltd. On February 4, 1975, the Company changed its name to International Shasta Resources Ltd. On May 20, 1994, the Company changed its name to Consolidated Shasta Resources Inc. On November 23, 1994, the Company changed its name again to Lima Gold Corporation and on September 21, 1999, the Company again changed its name to International Lima Resources Corp. On March 1, 2004, the Company changed its name to Crosshair Exploration & Mining Corp. On June 1, 2004 the Company transitioned (from a provincially incorporated entity to a federally incorporated entity) under the Business Corporation Act (British Columbia) (BCBCA). On October 28, 2011, the Company changed its name to Crosshair Energy Corporation. On September 17, 2013, the Company changed its name to Jet Metal Corp. On February 28, 2017, the Company continued as a corporation governed by the Canada Business Corporations Act and changed its name to Canada Jetlines Ltd.
 On June 23, 2020, the Company (at the time named Canada Jetlines Ltd.) consummated a business combination with Global Crossing Airlines, Inc.
 On December 22, 2020, the Company changed its jurisdiction of incorporation from the Province of British Columbia, Canada to the State of Delaware (the “U.S. Domestication“). In connection with the U.S. Domestication, the Company changed its name to “Global Crossing Airlines Group Inc.”
 Operations
 GlobalX operates a US Part 121 domestic flag and supplemental airline using the Airbus A320 family of aircraft. GlobalX will remain competitive by providing services on an Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance and Insurance basis (“ACMI”) along all in charter contracts to airlines operating within the United States and throughout North and South America, develop aircraft interchanges with leading European charter/tour operators, and ad-hoc and track charters for non-airline customers.
 GlobalX has completed the FAA regulatory certification process and received DOT approval. We are led by an operating team with a combined 190 years of Airline experience.
 GlobalX’s passenger aircraft fleet is built on the Airbus A320-200 fleet family. GlobalX started operations with one leased A320 in 2021 and it has a fleet of eight aircraft as of December 31, 2022 with plans to increase to 22 within the next 12 months.
 GlobalX’s cargo aircraft fleet is based on the Airbus A321 aircraft type. GlobalX started operations with one lease A321F aircraft in January 2023 and plans to increase to six A321F aircraft by the fourth quarter of 2023.
 
Location of Operations Bases
 
GlobalX will initially operate from one primary geographic base:
 •Miami International Airport (“MIA”) – GlobalX’s main base of operations is MIA, and, pursuant to its Airline Use Agreement with MIA (for which it has placed deposits of $495,000), GlobalX (1) operates charter flights out of Concourse E, and rents office space and operates its ticket counters, and (2) maintains a maintenance office for its maintenance staff and for storage of all aircraft records, as well as spare parts and consumables storage, with loading dock capabilities. While we do have an Airline Use Agreement in place with MIA, it does not guarantee availability of boarding gates or landing slots at that airport.
 GlobalX also maintains two additional crew bases at the following locations:


•San Antonio International Airport ("SAT") in San Antonio, Texas
 •Harry Reid International Airport ("LAS") in Las Vegas, Nevada
 Employees
 GlobalX had approximately 400 and 200 full time employees as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Government Regulation
 Aviation Regulation
 The airline industry is heavily regulated, especially by the federal government. Two of the primary regulatory authorities overseeing air transportation in the United States are the U.S. Department of Transportation (the “DOT”) and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (the “FAA”)  . The DOT has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity, exemptions and other economic authority required for airlines to provide domestic and foreign air transportation. International routes and international code-sharing arrangements are regulated by the DOT and by the governments of the foreign countries involved. A U.S. airline’s ability to operate flights to and from international destinations is subject to the air transport agreements between the United States and the foreign country and the carrier’s ability to obtain the necessary authority from the DOT and the applicable foreign government.
 The U.S. government has negotiated “open skies” agreements with many countries, which allow unrestricted access between the United States and the applicable foreign country and to points beyond the foreign country on flights serving the foreign country. With certain other countries, however, the United States has a restricted air transportation agreement.
 The FAA is responsible for regulating and overseeing matters relating to the safety of air carrier flight operations, including the control of navigable air space, the qualification of flight personnel, flight training practices, compliance with FAA airline operating certificate requirements, aircraft certification and maintenance requirements and other matters affecting air safety. The FAA requires each commercial airline to obtain and hold an FAA air carrier certificate. We currently hold an FAA air carrier certificate.
 GlobalX has a Part 121 Air Carrier Certification from the FAA. The FAA uses the process to ensure that the applicant (also referred to as Certificate Holder) is able to design, document, implement, and audit safety critical processes that do two things: (1) Comply with regulations and safety standards; and (2) manage hazard-related risks in the operating environment.
 The purpose of the Process is to determine whether an applicant can conduct business in a manner that complies with all applicable regulations and safety standards and allows the applicant to manage the hazard-related risks in its operating systems and environment. The Process is designed to preclude the certification of applicants who are unwilling or unable to comply with regulations or to conform to safe operating practices.
 The Process assures that the applicant’s processes, programs, systems, and intended methods of compliance are thoroughly reviewed, evaluated, and tested. Once completed, the Process provides confidence that the applicant’s infrastructure (programs, methods, and systems) results in continued compliance and provides the applicant with the ability to manage hazard related risks in its operating systems and environment.
 The FAA will not issue an air carrier certificate until the Safety Analysis and Promotion Division management, the Certification and Evaluation Program Office (CEPO) management, and Air Carrier Safety Assurance (ACSA) Management are confident and agree that the prospective certificate holder is able to provide service at the highest possible degree of safety in the public interest.
 As Title 49 of the United States Code states below, safety is both a priority and a legal responsibility of the Certificate Holder. It is up to the FAA to ensure that the Certificate Holder understands and accepts this duty prior to issuing the Air Carrier Certificate. The FAA receives its authority from:
 •Title 49 United States Code (USC), Section 44702, Issuance of Certificates states “When issuing a certificate under this part, the Administrator shall consider the duty of an air carrier to provide service with the highest possible degree of safety in the public interest “
 •Title 49 USC, Section 44705, Air Carrier Operating Certificates, states “The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall issue an air carrier operating certificate to a person desiring to operate as an air carrier when the Administrator finds, after investigation, that the person properly and adequately is equipped and able to operate safely under this part and regulations and standards prescribed under this part.”
 In order to assure that the policies listed above are followed, the FAA:


•Verifies that the applicant can operate safely and that the applicant complies with the regulations and standards prescribed by the Administrator before issuing an air carrier operating certificate and before approving or accepting air carrier programs.
 •Conducts periodic reviews to re-verify that the applicant organization continues to meet regulatory requirements when environmental changes occur.
 •Continually validates the performance of the applicant organization’s approved and accepted programs.
 Consumer Protection Regulation
 The DOT also has jurisdiction over certain economic issues affecting air transportation and consumer protection matters, including unfair or deceptive practices and unfair methods of competition, lengthy tarmac delays, airline advertising, denied boarding compensation, ticket refunds, baggage liability, contracts of carriage, customer service commitments, consumer notices and disclosures, customer complaints and transportation of passengers with disabilities. The DOT frequently adopts new consumer protection regulations, such as rules to protect passengers addressing lengthy tarmac delays, chronically delayed flights, codeshare disclosure and undisclosed display bias. They also have adopted, and do adopt, new rules on airline advertising and marketing practices. The DOT also has authority to review certain joint venture agreements, marketing agreements, code-sharing agreements (where an airline places its designator code on a flight operated by another airline) and wet-leasing agreements (where one airline provides aircraft and crew to another airline) between carriers and regulates other economic matters such as slot transactions.
Security Regulation
 The U.S. Transportation Security Administration (the “TSA”) and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”), each a division of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, are responsible for certain civil aviation security matters, including passenger and baggage screening at U.S. airports, and international passenger prescreening prior to entry into or departure from the United States. International flights are subject to customs, border, immigration and similar requirements of equivalent foreign governmental agencies. We are currently in compliance with all directives issued by such agencies.
Environmental Regulation
 We are subject to various federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and affecting matters such as air emissions (including GHG emissions), noise emissions, discharges to surface and subsurface waters, safe drinking water, and the use, management, release, discharge and disposal of, and exposure to, materials and chemicals.
 We are also subject to environmental laws and regulations that require us to investigate and remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain remediation standards. Under certain laws, generators of waste materials, and current and former owners or operators of facilities, can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at locations that have been identified as requiring response actions. Liability under these laws may be strict, joint and several, meaning that we could be liable for the costs of cleaning up environmental contamination regardless of fault or the amount of wastes directly attributable to us.
 GHG Emissions
 Concern about climate change and greenhouse gases has resulted, and is expected to continue to result, in additional regulation or taxation of aircraft emissions in the United States and abroad. In particular, on March 6, 2017, the ICAO an agency of the United Nations established to manage the administration and governance of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, adopted new carbon dioxide, or CO2 certification standards for new aircraft beginning in 2020. The new CO2 standards will apply to new aircraft type designs from 2020, and to aircraft type designs already in production as of 2023. In-production aircraft that do not meet the standard by 2028 will no longer be able to be produced unless their designs are modified to meet the new standards. In August 2016, the EPA made a final endangerment finding that GHG emissions cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare, which obligates the EPA under the Clean Air Act to set GHG emissions standards for aircraft. In August 2020, the EPA issued a proposed rule regulating GHG emissions from aircraft that largely conforms to the March 2017 ICAO standards. However, on January 20, 2021, the new presidential administration, which is expected to promote more aggressive policies with respect to climate change and carbon emissions, including in the aviation sector, announced a freeze with respect to all pending rulemaking. Accordingly, the outcome of this rulemaking may result in stricter GHG emissions standards than those contained in the proposed rule.
 Noise
 Federal law recognizes the right of airport operators with special noise problems to implement local noise abatement procedures so long as those procedures do not interfere unreasonably with interstate and foreign commerce and the national air transportation system, subject to FAA review under the Airport Noise and Control Act of 1990. These restrictions can include limiting nighttime operations,

directing specific aircraft operational procedures during take-off and initial climb and limiting the overall number of flights at an airport. While we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions in the past, our operations could be adversely impacted if ICAO or locally imposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread.
 Other Regulations
 Airlines are also subject to various other federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. For example, the U.S. Department of Justice has jurisdiction over certain airline competition matters. The privacy and security of passenger and employee data is regulated by various domestic and foreign laws and regulations.
 Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Our Operations
 The COVID-19 pandemic (the “Pandemic”) has created an unprecedented opportunity for GlobalX. When looking to launch an airline there are three primary barriers to entry; certification, access to airplanes and access to crew. The Pandemic has caused immense harm to the existing airline business, tens of thousands of people have been laid off and thousands of planes have been moved to long term storage. This has created an opportunity for GlobalX to hire highly experienced and qualified staff in addition to acquiring planes at rates more than half of those required before the Pandemic. Combine these two elements and it is our belief that GlobalX is positioned to secure a substantial cost advantage over existing competition in the near term.
 Effect of the Pandemic on aircraft availability. Due to the downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the lease terms to GlobalX for the aircraft it has leased and plans to lease have been favorably impacted by: (1) greater availability of aircraft in the required time frame; (2) lower lease cost; (3) a greater willingness for lessors to provide GlobalX, as a start-up airline, aircraft without onerous aircraft deposit and security conditions; (4) lessened impact of a licensing delay or other start-up delays on the cost of leased aircraft not flying; and (5) sister ship availability, which is desirable because such aircraft are configured similarly reduces the complexity of maintenance and the availability of spare parts inventory.
