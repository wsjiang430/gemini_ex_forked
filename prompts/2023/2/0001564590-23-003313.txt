Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel targeted therapeutics for cancer and utilizing our cost efficient, contract research organization (CRO) independent product development platform to partner with other life science companies to develop and commercialize innovative products in the United States.
 In December 2019, we entered into a collaboration and clinical trial agreement (the Envafolimab Collaboration Agreement) with 3D Medicines Co., Ltd. (3D Medicines) and Jiangsu Alphamab Biopharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. (Alphamab) for the development of envafolimab, also known as KN035, an investigational PD-L1 single-domain antibody (sdAb) administered by rapid subcutaneous injection for the treatment of sarcoma in North America. The ENVASARC Phase 2 pivotal trial (the ENVASARC trial) is enrolling a total of 160 patients at 600mg of envafolimab, with 80 patients enrolling at 600mg of envafolimab every three weeks in cohort C, and 80 patients enrolling at 600mg of envafolimab every three weeks in combination with Yervoy® at 1mg/kg every three weeks for four doses in cohort D, in the sarcoma subtypes of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) and myxofibrosarcoma (MFS). Nine of 80 responses by blinded independent central review (BICR) in either cohort are needed to satisfy the primary objective of the trial which is to statistically exceed the known 4% objective response rate (ORR) of Votrient® (pazopanib), the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for patients with refractory UPS or MFS. Achieving the primary endpoint of exceeding the known 4% ORR could be the basis for accelerated approval of envafolimab by the FDA as a single agent and/or in combination with Yervoy. The trial will provide at least 86% power to demonstrate the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval is greater than 5% in each cohort, which would be greater than the 4% ORR of Votrient reported in soft tissue sarcoma in its package insert. Votrient is the only approved treatment for refractory soft tissue sarcoma, which includes UPS and MFS.
 In August and October 2022, we announced that the ENVASARC trial will proceed as planned after the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) reviewed three and twelve weeks of safety data, respectively, from more than 20 patients enrolled in the trial as of June 30, 2022. The safety data reviewed included data from more than 10 patients enrolled into cohort C of treatment with single agent envafolimab at 600mg every three weeks and more than 10 patients enrolled into cohort D of treatment with envafolimab at 600mg every three weeks in combination with Yervoy (ipilimumab). 
 In December 2022, we announced the IDMC recommended continued accrual as planned in both cohorts at the first planned interim efficacy analysis. The IDMC reviewed interim safety and efficacy data from 18 patients enrolled into each cohort who completed a minimum of 12 weeks of efficacy evaluations (two on-treatment scans). The double-digit ORR assessed by BICR in each cohort exceeded the prespecified futility rule that required at least one response among the initial 18 patients enrolled at 600mg into each cohort. Envafolimab monotherapy (cohort C) and in combination with Yervoy (cohort D) was well tolerated, with only a single related serious adverse event reported in 36 patients. A second interim efficacy analysis is planned following the 12-week efficacy scan in the 92nd dosed patient, to allow for determination of the preliminary ORR, which we expect in the third quarter of 2023. There must be at least three responses among the initial 46 patients enrolled at 600mg into each cohort to continue enrollment in that cohort per the futility rule of the trial.
 In September 2022, we announced that the FDA had granted us fast track designation for the development of envafolimab for patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic UPS and MFS who have progressed on one or two prior lines of chemotherapy. We are also eligible to apply for breakthrough therapy designation based on data from the ENVASARC clinical trial. We expect to complete enrollment by the end of 2023, have final response assessment data including duration of response in all patients from the ENVASARC trial in mid-2024, and, assuming positive data, to submit a biologics license application (BLA) to the FDA seeking accelerated approval in 2024. At any time that we reach nine responses in each cohort and meet the endpoint, we expect to discuss the submission process with the FDA.
 Our other clinical stage oncology product candidates include YH001, which is a monospecific investigational cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) antibody, that we licensed from Eucure (Beijing) Biopharma Co., Ltd. (Eucure) and Biocytogen Pharmaceuticals (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (Biocytogen) in October 2021, TRC102, which is a small molecule that has been studied in Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials for the treatment of mesothelioma, lung cancer, glioblastoma and solid tumors, and TJ004309, which is a CD73 antibody in Phase 1 clinical development for the treatment of solid tumors, that we licensed from I-Mab Biopharma (I-Mab) in November 2018.

YH001 is an investigational humanized CTLA-4 IgG1 monoclonal antibody that completed dosing in two Phase 1 trials sponsored by Eucure for the treatment of various cancer indications. CTLA-4 is a protein expressed on T-cells and expressed at high levels specifically on regulatory T-cells that act as a checkpoint to inhibit effector T-cell immune responses to cancer cells. The CTLA-4 inhibitor Yervoy (ipilimumab) marketed by BMS has been approved as a single agent in melanoma and approved in combination with other therapies in multiple indications including non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) cancer. Data from the Phase 1 dose escalation trial in Australia of YH001 in combination with the PD-1 antibody, toripalimab, were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology 2022 Annual Meeting. YH001 was well tolerated up to 4 mg/kg when combined with toripalimab in the 24 patients as of the December 31, 2021 data cut-off date. The Phase 1 dose escalation trial in China of YH001 as a single agent, recently completed enrollment and determined a recommended Phase 2 dose. We expect data to be presented in the second half of 2023. No CTLA-4 therapy is approved by the FDA for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. 
 In August 2022, we announced that the FDA had approved the Investigational New Drug (IND) application for the initiation of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of YH001 in combination with envafolimab and doxorubicin, an approved treatment for soft tissue sarcoma, for the treatment of sarcoma patients and in December 2022, we initiated dosing in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial. The Phase 1/2 trial will assess the safety and efficacy of the triplet combination of YH001, envafolimab and doxorubicin in the common sarcoma subtypes of leiomyosarcoma and dedifferentiated liposarcoma, and we expect Phase 1 data in the second half of 2023. In addition, the trial will assess the safety and efficacy of the doublet combination of YH001 and envafolimab in patients with the rare sarcoma subtypes of alveolar soft part sarcoma and chondrosarcoma. Additionally, we plan to initiate trials of YH001 as a single agent or in combination with immunotherapies in other tumor types.
 TRC102 is a small molecule in clinical development to reverse resistance to specific chemotherapeutics by inhibiting DNA base excision repair (BER). In initial clinical trials of more than 100 patients, TRC102 has shown good tolerability and we believe promising anti-tumor activity in combination with alkylating and antimetabolite chemotherapy for the treatment of cancer patients. TRC102 has been studied in Phase 1 or Phase 2 trials in mesothelioma patients in combination with the approved chemotherapeutic Alimta® (pemetrexed), in glioblastoma, ovarian cancer, lung and colorectal cancer patients in combination with the approved chemotherapeutic Temodar® (temozolomide) and in lung cancer patients in combination with the approved chemotherapeutics Alimta and cisplatin as well as external beam radiation (i.e., chemoradiation). All current TRC102 trials are sponsored and funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). We retain global rights to develop and commercialize TRC102 in all indications. In October 2020, we received orphan drug designation (ODD) from the FDA for TRC102 for the treatment of patients with malignant glioma, including glioblastoma. O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) deficiency is observed in about one-third of glioblastoma patients, and a prior study of Temodar and TRC102 reported at the Society for Neuro-Oncology in 2018 demonstrated that two MGMT deficient glioblastoma patients had prolonged survival when treated with Temodar and TRC102 after progressing previously on Temodar and radiation therapy. A December 2020 publication in Cancer Cell also demonstrated Temodar and TRC102 were active in MGMT deficient patients with colorectal cancer. Based on these data, we believe a trial in first line glioblastoma patients of Temodar, radiation therapy and TRC102 is warranted and are discussing further development with investigators at this time. In addition, based on data presented at the ASCO 2020 virtual meeting that the combination of chemoradiation and TRC102 produced objective responses in all 15 evaluable patients with advanced localized lung cancer treated in a Phase 1 trial, in January 2022, the NCI initiated a randomized Phase 2 trial of chemoradiation with or without TRC102, followed by consolidative durvalumab treatment. The primary objective is to improve the 56% one-year progression free survival (PFS) rate with current standard of care to 75% with current standard of care plus TRC102. The trial began enrollment in June 2022 and is expected to be complete in 2025.
 TJ004309, also known as TJD5 or uliledlimab, is a novel humanized antibody against CD73 expressed on stromal cells and tumors that converts extracellular adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to the immunosuppressive metabolite adenosine. We are developing TJ004309 in collaboration with I-Mab under a strategic collaboration and clinical trial agreement that we entered into in November 2018 (the TJ004309 Agreement). In July 2019, we began enrollment in a Phase 1 clinical trial to assess safety and preliminary efficacy of TJ004309 as a single agent and when combined with the PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor Tecentriq® in patients with advanced solid tumors, and in June 2021 we presented data from the ongoing Phase 1 trial at the ASCO 2021 virtual meeting. In a poster presentation titled “The safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and clinical efficacy of uliledlimab (TJ004309), a differentiated CD73 antibody, in combination with atezolizumab in patients with advanced cancer,” uliledlimab was found to be well-tolerated up to 20mg/kg every three weeks and 15mg/kg once weekly as a monotherapy and in combination therapy with atezolizumab 1200mg every three weeks and no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached. There was one complete response in a PD-(L)1 naïve patient, two partial responses (PRs) with one PR in a PD-(L)1 naïve patient and one PR in a PD-(L)1 refractory patient, and three cases of stable disease (SD) following treatment with uliledlimab and atezolizumab. 
 We entered into a separate strategic collaboration and clinical trial agreement (the Bispecific Agreement) which allows for the development of up to five of I-Mab’s proprietary bispecific antibody (the BsAb) product candidates to be nominated by I-Mab within a five-year period for development and commercialization in North America, with the option to opt-in and acquire product rights outside of Greater China and Korea prior to completing the first pivotal clinical trial for any bispecific product candidate.

In March 2020, I-Mab issued a press release announcing a strategic partnership with Kalbe Genexine Biologics (KG Bio), whereby KG Bio received what the press release described as a right of first negotiation outside North America for TJ004309 for up to $340 million in potential payments to I-Mab. In March 2020, we also learned that I-Mab had entered into two license and collaboration agreements with ABL Bio in July 2018 (ABL Bio License 1 and ABL Bio License 2). Under ABL Bio License 1, I-Mab granted to ABL Bio exclusive, worldwide (excluding Greater China), royalty-bearing rights to develop and commercialize a BsAb using certain monoclonal antibody sequences. Under ABL License 2, I-Mab and ABL agreed to collaborate to develop three PD-L1-based bispecific antibodies by using ABL Bio’s proprietary BsAb technology and commercialize them in their respective territories, which, collectively, include China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and South Korea, and other territories throughout the rest of the world if both parties agree to do so in such other territories during the performance of the agreement.
 In June 2020, I-Mab commenced an arbitration proceeding under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the ICC) before an arbitration tribunal seated in New York City (the Tribunal) after we invoked contractual dispute resolution provisions asserting that I-Mab had breached its contractual obligations concerning two strategic collaboration and clinical trial agreements with us entered into in November 2018.  Those strategic collaboration and clinical trial agreements relate to the development of TJ004309 and five of I-Mab’s proprietary bispecific antibody product candidates to be nominated by I-Mab within a five-year period for development and commercialization in North America. We filed counterclaims in the arbitration seeking to recover over $200 million in damages from I-Mab based on I-Mab’s breaches of the two strategic collaboration and clinical trial agreements. In 2021, I-Mab sent us notices purporting to terminate the TJ004309 Agreement, which would result in I-Mab owing us a prespecified termination fee of $9.0 million. However, I-Mab does not have an option to terminate the TJ004309 Agreement without cause until the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of TJ004309 is “Complete,” as that term is defined in the TJ004309 Agreement, and we responded by disputing the basis for I-Mab’s termination. In March 2021, I-Mab filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery seeking a variety of relief including an order of specific performance requiring us to comply with I-Mab’s purported termination of the TJ004309 Agreement. In May 2021, the Delaware Court of Chancery stayed the lawsuit in favor of arbitration. The Tribunal held a hearing on the merits in February 2022, and final post-hearing briefs were submitted by us and I-Mab in May 2022. On November 8, 2022, the Tribunal invited the parties to submit additional, limited briefing on two discrete issues by December 9, 2022. Following that submission, the parties submitted their respective cost submissions for attorney fees reimbursement in January 2023. The Tribunal did not indicate when it expects to render its final decision; however, it did note that it was far along in its deliberations and preparation of a final award. We expect the Tribunal to render its final decision in the first quarter of 2023. 
 Under the applicable rules of the arbitration, the prevailing party may be awarded attorneys’ fees at the Tribunal’s discretion. The claims under the arbitration are complex; accordingly, we cannot predict the outcome of the arbitration, and we are unable to estimate the amount of recovery or damages, if any, that may be awarded by the Tribunal. The dispute with I-Mab has caused, and could continue to cause, us to incur significant costs.
 The following table summarizes key information regarding ongoing and planned development of our clinical stage product candidates:

 We utilize a CRO-independent product development platform that emphasizes capital efficiency. Our experienced clinical operations, data management, quality assurance, product development and regulatory affairs groups manage significant aspects of our clinical trials with internal resources. We use these internal resources to reduce the costs associated with utilizing CROs to conduct clinical trials. In our experience, this model has resulted in capital efficiencies and improved communication with clinical trial sites, which can expedite patient enrollment and improve the quality of patient data as compared to a CRO-managed model. We have leveraged this platform in all of our sponsored clinical trials. We have also leveraged our product development platform to diversify our product pipeline without payment of upfront license fees through license agreements with Eucure and Biocytogen, 3D Medicines and Alphamab, I-Mab, and Janssen. We continue to evaluate life science companies that would benefit from a rapid and capital-efficient U.S. drug development solution that includes U.S. and European Union (EU) clinical development expertise. We believe we will continue to be recognized as a preferred U.S. clinical development partner through a cost- and risk-sharing partnership structure, which may include U.S. commercialization. 
 Our goal is to be a leader in the development of targeted therapies for patients with cancer and other diseases of high unmet medical need.

Our Lead Clinical Stage Product Candidate – Envafolimab
 
Overview of PD-L1
 PD-L1 is an immune-inhibitory checkpoint molecule expressed on epithelial and vascular endothelial cells, as well as by a number of immune cells, that is utilized by tumor cells as an immune escape mechanism. Numerous preclinical and clinical studies of PD-1/PD-L1 products have demonstrated that antibodies that block the interaction of PD-1 with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, or those that block only the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1, can augment anti-tumor T-cell responses and lead to complete and durable tumor eradication in a certain proportion of patients.  Potent therapeutic anti-tumor responses due to blocking of the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction has been demonstrated by these approved products in patients with various solid tumors including, but not limited to, NSCLC, small cell lung cancer, gastric cancer, melanoma, RCC, head and neck cancer, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and urothelial carcinoma.
About Envafolimab and Preclinical Studies
 Envafolimab is a sdAb that binds selectively to PD-L1 and is administered by rapid subcutaneous injection without an adjuvant.  In November 2021 we announced that our partners 3D Medicines and Alphamab had received marketing authorization for envafolimab from the Chinese National Medical Products Association (NMPA) in the indication of MSI-H/dMMR cancer, and is being further developed by 3D Medicines for the treatment of various cancer indications, including an ongoing first line biliary tract cancer (BTC) pivotal trial in China, and by us in the United States for the treatment of sarcoma in the pivotal ENVASARC trial.
 Single-domain antibodies are a novel class of therapeutic protein that contain the unique structural and functional properties of naturally-occurring antibodies from camels and llamas that contain heavy chains and lack light chains. On February 6, 2019, the FDA approved the first sdAb, Cablivi® (caplacizumab), for adults with acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
 Envafolimab is a camelid IgG1 sdAb with single digit nanomolar affinity to PD-L1. Benefitting from the sdAb format, envafolimab has approximately half the molecular weight compared to a typical monoclonal antibody with better stability and high solubility, which enables the development of a high concentration formulation suitable for rapid subcutaneous injection. In addition, the effector functions are muted in envafolimab to help limit side effects and limit its exposure to the immune system to avoid unwanted adverse immune responses. As a result, compared with approved PD-(L)1 inhibitors, envafolimab potentially has the following advantages:
  
• | Better patient compliance with increased convenience. Subcutaneous injection enables more rapid administration and the potential for self-injection, which enables better patient compliance with the treatment regimen;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Relatively stable plasma-drug concentration. The plasma-drug concentration of envafolimab is relatively stable without significant fluctuations due to the nature of subcutaneous administration. This unique PK profile compared with intravenous formulations may result in lower risks to patients; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential for improved tumor penetration. Envafolimab is approximately half the size of a typical monoclonal antibody, which may provide for improved tumor penetration in cancer patients as was observed in pre-clinical experiments. This unique tumor penetration compared with typical monoclonal antibodies may improve efficacy.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In pre-clinical studies in human cell models and a humanized mouse model, envafolimab was compared with 2.41H90P, an antibody with a sequence that is identical to durvalumab, an approved PD-L1 inhibitor marketed by AstraZeneca, and envafolimab showed the following potential advantages: 
  
• | Stronger T-cell activation effect. The level of T-cell activation can be measured by the secretion levels of IFN- and IL-2. Higher secretion levels are generally associated with stronger T-cell activation. In pre-clinical studies, envafolimab (referred to as KN035) demonstrated higher potency and a higher maximal stimulatory effect on IFN- and IL-2 secretion compared to 2.41H90P, as illustrated in the following figure.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Higher anti-tumor efficacy. Envafolimab and 2.41H90P were each injected intraperitoneally in mice at 0.1mg/kg, 0.3mg/kg and 1.0mg/kg dose levels. As illustrated in the following graph, envafolimab showed more potent tumor growth inhibition effects with maximum inhibition demonstrated at a ten-fold lower dose.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | More rapid tumor penetration. After injection of envafolimab and 2.4H90P in tumor bearing nude mice, the tumor radioactivity signal was consistently higher in the envafolimab group up to 52 hours post injection. The tumor radioactivity signal in the envafolimab group between 1 hour to 2.5 hours was statistically significantly higher, which suggests potentially better distribution of envafolimab into the tumor.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clinical Trials of Envafolimab
 As of December 31, 2022, envafolimab had been dosed in more than 1,000 patients in a total of more than 7 ongoing or completed clinical trials in the United States, China or Japan, including our ENVASARC trial, a pivotal Phase 2 trial in MSI-H/dMMR cancer patients in China, a Phase 2 trial of envafolimab plus chemotherapy in gastric cancer, a Phase 3 randomized trial of envafolimab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in BTC in China, a Phase 1 dose escalation and dose exploration trial in the United States, a Phase 1 dose escalation and dose exploration trial in China, and a Phase 1 dose escalation and dose exploration trial in Japan.

Phase 1 Dose Escalation Clinical Trial in China
 An open-label, single-arm Phase 1 dose escalation and exploration clinical trial of envafolimab has completed enrollment in China. The safety and efficacy data from this trial were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in June 2019. Based on the data presented at the 2019 ASCO Annual Meeting (the ASCO Presentation), 17 subjects were enrolled in the dose escalation phase in this trial as of May 1, 2019. A total of 287 subjects were enrolled in this Phase 1 trial at dose levels shown to be tolerable during dose escalation.
 Trial purpose. The primary objectives of the Phase 1 dose escalation were to assess the safety and tolerability profile and MTD of single agent envafolimab administered subcutaneously in subjects with advanced solid tumors. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the PK profile, immunogenicity and anti-tumor activity.
 Trial design of the dose escalation phase. This trial adopted a modified “3+3” design with a DLT evaluation period of 28 days. Subjects received envafolimab in six cohorts at 0.1mg/kg, 0.3mg/kg, 1.0mg/kg, 2.5mg/kg, 5.0mg/kg and 10.0mg/kg once every week (QW) subcutaneously. Starting from the 1.0mg/kg cohort, a traditional “3+3” design was followed. Safety and tolerability were assessed by monitoring treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Tumor assessments were performed based on RECIST version 1.1.
 Safety of dose escalation phase. The majority of the subjects received two or more prior systemic oncology treatments. According to the ASCO Presentation, 16 of the subjects discontinued treatment due to disease progression (n=15) or consent withdrawal (n=1). All of the enrolled subjects experienced TEAEs. 13 (76.5%) subjects experienced treatment-related TEAEs. Three (17.6%) subjects experienced serious TEAEs, although none were determined to be treatment-related. A TEAE led to treatment discontinuation in one subject and was also determined to be not treatment-related. No DLT was reported and the MTD was not reached. Details of the TEAEs observed from the 17 subjects enrolled in the Phase 1 dose escalation trial are summarized in the following table.

Efficacy. According to the ASCO Presentation, 15 out of 17 subjects were evaluable for the efficacy analysis. Three subjects had confirmed PR, including one RCC subject in the 2.5mg/kg cohort, one intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma subject from the 5.0mg/kg cohort and one BTC subject from the 10.0mg/kg cohort. In addition, five subjects achieved stable disease. All 15 subjects completed at least one post-baseline tumor assessment, according to the ASCO Presentation. Two enrolled subjects who had not reached the first post-baseline tumor assessment were excluded. The table below summarizes the best overall response in the efficacy analysis of this trial, according to the ASCO Presentation.
 
The following waterfall plot shows the best overall response of the 15 evaluable subjects receiving envafolimab as measured by percentage of change of target lesions from baseline, according to the ASCO Presentation.
 
Conclusion. According to the ASCO Presentation, envafolimab exhibited a tolerable safety profile and preliminary efficacy in patients with advanced malignancies in the Phase 1 dose escalation trial in China.

Phase 1 Dose Escalation Clinical Trial in the United States
An open-label Phase 1 dose escalation and dose exploration clinical trial of envafolimab was conducted in the United States. Safety and efficacy data from the dose escalation phase of the trial were presented at the 2018 Annual Congress of the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) in October 2018. Based on the data presented at ESMO (the ESMO Presentation), 18 subjects were enrolled in the dose escalation phase of this trial as of July 5, 2018. 
 Trial purpose of the dose escalation phase. The primary objectives of the Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial were to evaluate and characterize the tolerability and safety profile of single agent envafolimab in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The secondary objectives were to characterize the PK profile, determine MTD and to evaluate anti-tumor activity. 
 Trial design of the dose escalation phase. This trial adopted a modified “3+3” design with a DLT evaluation period of 28 days. Subjects received envafolimab across eight cohorts at 0.01mg/kg, 0.03mg/kg, 0.1mg/kg, 0.3mg/kg, 1.0mg/kg, 2.5mg/kg, 5.0mg/kg and 10.0mg/kg QW subcutaneously. Starting from the 0.3mg/kg cohort, a traditional “3+3” design was followed. Safety and tolerability were assessed by monitoring TEAEs. Tumor assessments were performed based on RECIST version 1.1.
 Safety of dose escalation phase. The median duration of exposure to envafolimab was 9 weeks with a range of 6 to 32 weeks. As of July 5, 2018, two of the subjects (11.1%) remained in the trial, 11 subjects had discontinued treatment due to disease progression, three subjects had discontinued treatment due to TEAEs, and two subjects had discontinued treatment due to the opinion of the investigator that no more clinical benefit could be obtained or for other reasons. All of the 18 enrolled subjects experienced TEAEs. Treatment-related TEAEs at grade 3 or above included increased aspartate aminotransferase (10.5%), increased alanine aminotransferase (10.5%) and lymphopenia (10.5%). No DLT was observed and the planned maximum dose of 10.0mg/kg was reached. 
 Efficacy of dose escalation phase. According to the ESMO Presentation, 17 out of 18 subjects were evaluable for the efficacy analysis. Two subjects had confirmed PR, including one NSCLC subject from the 0.3mg/kg QW cohort (response duration of 9 months) and one MSI-H prostate cancer subject from the 2.5mg/kg QW cohort. In addition, five subjects achieved SD. All 17 evaluable subjects completed at least one post-baseline tumor assessment according to the ESMO Presentation. One enrolled subject who had not reached the first post-baseline tumor assessment was excluded. The table below summarizes the best overall response in the efficacy analysis of this trial according to the ESMO Presentation.

PK profile of dose escalation phase. This trial showed that the exposure to envafolimab was dose-dependent and increased proportionally across all eight dose levels. Mean half-life of envafolimab was approximately 200 hours. 
 Conclusion. According to the ESMO Presentation, envafolimab exhibited a favorable safety profile in subjects with advanced solid tumors and preliminary efficacy results demonstrated encouraging anti-tumor activity. Based on the PK profile, patients in the trial were treated with envafolimab at 300mg every 4 weeks by subcutaneous injection.

Phase 1 Clinical Trial in Japan
An open-label Phase 1 dose escalation and dose exploration clinical trial of envafolimab was conducted in Japan. The safety, efficacy and PK data of this trial as of May 5, 2019 were presented at the ASCO Annual Meeting in June 2019. Based on the data presented in the ASCO Annual Meeting (the Japan Trial ASCO Presentation), 26 subjects were enrolled in this trial as of May 5, 2019. 
 Trial purpose. The primary objectives of the Phase 1 clinical trial were to assess the safety and tolerability profile of single agent envafolimab in Japanese subjects with previously treated advanced solid tumors. The secondary objectives were to characterize the PK profile, determine MTD and evaluate the anti-tumor activity. 
 Trial design. This Phase 1 trial consisted of a multi-dose escalation phase followed by a dose exploration phase. Subjects received envafolimab across five cohorts at 1.0mg/kg, 2.5mg/kg and 5.0mg/kg QW subcutaneously, and 2.5mg/kg and 5.0mg/kg Q2W subcutaneously. The QW schedule adopted a traditional “3+3” design. For the Q2W schedule, six patients were planned for each cohort. Safety and tolerability were assessed by monitoring TEAEs under common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) version 4.0. Tumor assessments were performed based on RECIST version 1.1. Full PK sampling was performed after the first dose of cycle 1 (28 days) and sparse PK samples were collected at pre-dose and around Cmax during the subsequent cycles. 
 Safety. According to the Japan Trial ASCO Presentation, as of May 5, 2019, no MTD had been reached. As of the same date, three subjects had remained in the trial. 21 subjects had discontinued treatment due to disease progression and two subjects had discontinued treatment due to TEAEs. All of the enrolled subjects experienced TEAEs, 17 subjects (65.4%) experienced treatment-related TEAEs, and only one grade 3 treatment-related TEAE (cerebral infraction) was reported. There were no grade 4/5 treatment-related TEAEs. There were a total of four serious adverse events, two of which were treatment-related. No DLT was reported. 
 Efficacy. According to the Japan Trial ASCO Presentation, nine out of 26 patients were evaluable for the efficacy analysis as of May 5, 2019. Two subjects had confirmed PR and two subjects had unconfirmed PR. The other five evaluable subjects had achieved SD. 17 enrolled subjects who did not reach the first post-baseline tumor assessment were excluded.
 PK profile. In the dose escalation phase, the exposure to envafolimab was dose-dependent and increased proportionally. Tmax varied from 96 to 168 hours after a single dose as shown in Figure 1 below. In the dose exploration phase, the exposure to envafolimab was dose-dependent and increased proportionally. Preliminary PK suggested a prolonged half-life that may support a less frequent dosing schedule than once every 2 weeks.
 
Conclusion. Envafolimab exhibited a favorable safety profile in patients with advanced malignancies and preliminary efficacy results demonstrated promising anti-tumor activity in the Phase 1 clinical trial in Japan. Based on the PK profile, patients in the trial were treated with envafolimab at 300mg every 4 weeks by subcutaneous injection.

Pivotal Clinical Trial in China in MSI-H/dMMR tumors
 A pivotal clinical trial of envafolimab dosed as a single agent for the treatment of MSI-H/dMMR tumors was initiated in August 2018.  The trial was a non-randomized trial enrolling approximately 110 patients in China, including CRC patients who are required to have been previously treated with standard therapies, which must include fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin or irinotecan, and other solid tumor patients, who are required to have been previously treated with at least one line of systemic standard of care therapy. Patients received 150mg of envafolimab subcutaneously dosed weekly and ORR was the primary endpoint defined by RECIST version 1.1.  In a presentation at the CSCO 2020 Virtual Scientific Program entitled, “Subcutaneous Injection of PD-L1 Antibody Envafolimab (KN035) in Advanced Tumors with Mismatch-Repair Deficiency,” single agent envafolimab was shown to have a 32% confirmed ORR by central radiographic review in 41 patients with MSI-H/dMMR CRC who failed a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan, and had at least two on-study tumor assessments. The 32% ORR is nearly identical to the 28% ORR reported for Opdivo and 33% ORR reported for Keytruda in separate trials of MSI-H/dMMR CRC patients who failed a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan. DOR was greater than or equal to 12 months in 75% of patients and OS was greater than or equal to 12 months in 65% of patients. The ORR in the overall population (n=103) of MSI-H/dMMR cancer patients, including tumor types other than CRC, was 43%, DOR was greater than or equal to 12 months in 92% of patients and OS was greater than or equal to 12 months in 75% of patients. In November 2021, envafolimab received marketing authorization from the Chinese NMPA and was approved for adult patients with MSI-H/dMMR advanced solid tumors, including those patients with advanced colorectal cancer who have experienced disease progression following treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan, as well as patients with other advanced solid tumors who have experienced disease progression following prior systemic treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options.
 Clinical Development in Sarcoma in the United States   
 The ENVASARC trial is enrolling a total of 160 patients at 600mg of envafolimab, with 80 patients enrolling at 600mg of envafolimab every three weeks in cohort C, and 80 patients enrolling at 600mg of envafolimab every three weeks in combination with Yervoy® at 1mg/kg every three weeks for four doses in cohort D, in the sarcoma subtypes of UPS and MFS. Nine of 80 responses by BICR in either cohort are needed to satisfy the primary objective of the trial which is to statistically exceed the known 4% ORR of Votrient® (pazopanib), the only FDA-approved treatment for patients with refractory UPS or MFS. Achieving the primary endpoint of ORR could be the basis for accelerated approval of envafolimab by the FDA as a single agent and/or in combination with Yervoy. The trial will provide at least 86% power to demonstrate the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval is greater than 5% in each cohort, which would be greater than the 4% ORR of Votrient reported in soft tissue sarcoma in its package insert. Votrient is the only approved treatment for refractory soft tissue sarcoma, which includes UPS and MFS.
 In August and October 2022, we announced that the ENVASARC trial will proceed as planned after the IDMC reviewed three and twelve weeks of safety data, respectively, from more than 20 patients enrolled in the trial as of June 30, 2022. The safety data reviewed included data from more than 10 patients enrolled into cohort C of treatment with single agent envafolimab at 600mg every three weeks and more than 10 patients enrolled into cohort D of treatment with envafolimab at 600mg every three weeks in combination with Yervoy (ipilimumab). 
 In December 2022, we announced the IDMC recommended continued accrual as planned in both cohorts at the first planned interim efficacy analysis. The IDMC reviewed interim safety and efficacy data from 18 patients enrolled into each cohort who completed a minimum of 12 weeks of efficacy evaluations (two on-treatment scans). The double-digit ORR assessed by BICR in each cohort more than satisfied the prespecified futility rule that required at least one response among the initial 18 patients enrolled at 600mg into each cohort. Envafolimab monotherapy (cohort C) and in combination with Yervoy (cohort D) was well tolerated, with only a single related serious adverse event reported in 36 patients. A second interim efficacy analysis is planned following the 12-week efficacy scan in the 92nd dosed patient, to allow for determination of the preliminary ORR, which we expect in the third quarter of 2023. There must be at least three responses among the initial 46 patients enrolled at 600mg into each cohort to continue enrollment in that cohort per the futility rule of the trial.
 In September 2022, we announced that the FDA had granted us fast track designation for the development of envafolimab for patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic UPS and MFS who have progressed on one or two prior lines of chemotherapy. We are also eligible to apply for breakthrough therapy designation based on data from the ENVASARC clinical trial. We expect to complete enrollment by the end of 2023, have final response assessment data including duration of response in all patients from the ENVASARC trial in mid-2024, and, assuming positive data, to submit a BLA to the FDA seeking accelerated approval in 2024. At any time that we reach nine responses in each cohort and meet the endpoint, we expect to discuss the submission process with the FDA.
 UPS has an incidence of 0.8 to 1.0 cases per 100,000 patients in the western world per orpha.net and accounts for 10-15% of new cases of soft tissue sarcoma in the United States, with prevalence rates estimated at approximately 1.5 to 2.0 times incidence, and MFS accounts for half as many cases as UPS in the United States. We estimate that marketing envafolimab in refractory UPS and MFS could generate peak annual sales of up to $200 million in the United States without considering a price premium to the reference PD-1 inhibitors Opdivo (nivolumab) or Keytruda (pembrolizumab) that are administered intravenously. We estimate that marketing envafolimab in rarer sarcoma subtypes where the activity of checkpoint inhibition has been demonstrated could generate annual sales of up to $100 million in the United States.

Other Ongoing Clinical Trials
 A Phase 3 randomized clinical trial in BTC was initiated by 3D Medicines in April 2018.  This trial is an open-label trial to assess the safety and efficacy of envafolimab plus standard of care gemcitabine-based chemotherapy compared to gemcitabine-based chemotherapy alone with OS as the primary endpoint. In the envafolimab arm, envafolimab will be dosed at 2.5mg/kg subcutaneously QW, along with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin at recommended doses. The trial is expected to enroll over 390 patients in China and data are expected in 2023.
 A Phase 2 clinical trial of envafolimab in combination with folinic acid, fluorouracil and oxaliplatin chemotherapy (FOLFOX) in the first line treatment of advanced gastric cancer was fully enrolled (n=15) as of January 15, 2019. In an abstract at the ASCO 2020 Virtual Scientific Program entitled “Envafolimab plus chemotherapy in advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) cancer” data were reported in 15 patients who were evaluable for response. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status was 1 in 80% of subjects and the majority had gastric cancer (86.7%). At the time of data cutoff, the minimum follow-up was 6 months. The occurrence of TEAEs was 100% (all grades) and 73.3% (grades 3-4). The most frequent grade 3-4 TEAEs included neutrophil count decreased 46.7%, anemia 20.0%, and platelet disorder 20% (3/15). Confirmed ORR was 60% (unconfirmed ORR: 73.3%). Median DOR was not reached. Median PFS was 6.8 months.
 
Our Second Clinical Stage Product Candidate – YH001
 YH001 is an investigational humanized CTLA-4 IgG1 monoclonal antibody.  YH001 is being developed by Eucure for the treatment of various cancer indications. In October 2021, we entered into a collaborative development and commercialization agreement with Eucure and Biocytogen pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive license to develop and commercialize YH001 in North America for the treatment of multiple specified indications. 
 CTLA-4 is a protein expressed on all T-cells but which is expressed at the highest level on Tregs and contributes to the suppressor function of Tregs and acts as a checkpoint that prevents T-cell immune responses to cancer cells. A CTLA-4 inhibitor has been approved as a single agent in melanoma and approved in combination with other therapies in multiple indications including NSCLC, RCC and MSI-H colorectal cancer. 
 
Clinical Development of YH001
 As of December 31, 2021, YH001 had been dosed to more than 41 patients in China and Australia in two completed Phase 1 clinical trials.  YH001 is also being studied in additional ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials in combination with investigational and approved immunotherapies China sponsored by Eucure.
Phase I Dose Escalation Clinical Trial in Australia
 An open-label, single-arm Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial of YH001 in combination with the PD-1 antibody, toripalimab, was completed in Australia. The safety and efficacy data from this trial were presented at the 2022 ASCO Annual Meeting in June 2022. Based on the data presented in the ASCO presentation, 24 subjects were enrolled in this trial as of December 31, 2021. 
 Study purpose. The primary objectives of the Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial were to assess the safety and tolerability profile and MTD of YH001 in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor toripalimab in subjects with advanced solid tumors. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the PK profile and anti-tumor activity.
 
Study design. This trial adopted a modified “3+3” design. Subjects receive YH001 in six cohorts at 0.05mg/kg, 0.1mg/kg, 0.3mg/kg, 1.0mg/kg, 2.0mg/kg, 4.0mg/kg, and 6.0mg/kg by IV administration during a three week run-in period, after which subjects receive YH001 in combination with 240mg of the PD-1 antibody toripalimab every three weeks for four doses. 
 Safety. At the December 31, 2021 data cutoff, the maximum tolerated and recommended Phase 2 dose of YH001 when given with toripalimab was 4 mg/kg i.v. every three weeks for up to one year of dosing.
 Efficacy. Among 23 patients that had tumor imaging assessments available at the December 31, 2021 data cut-off, four achieved PR by RECIST, including in one patient with urothelial cancer who had failed prior treatment with a PD-1 antibody, and nine had stable disease.

Conclusion. The authors concluded that YH001 was well tolerated up to 4 mg/kg when combined with toripalimab and demonstrated activity in patients with advanced solid tumors.
 
Phase I Dose Escalation Clinical Trial in China
 An open-label, single-arm Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial of YH001 was completed in China. 
 
Preclinical Studies
 In pre-clinical studies in mice, YH001 was compared with ipilimumab, an approved CTLA-4 inhibitor marketed by BMS, and YH001 showed the following potential advantages: 
 
 
• | Superior in vivo activity compared to ipilimumab as a single agent and when combined with pembrolizumab, a PD-1 antibody marketed by Merck. The following graphs illustrate the tumor size growth and body weight changes in mice.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | More potent and active than ipilimumab. YH001 was more potent and active than ipilimumab in blocking hCTLA-4 inhibition of CD80/86 activity. The following graph illustrates an in vitro reporter assay demonstrating the ability of YH001 or ipilimumab to induce T-cell proliferation by inhibiting the interaction of hCTLA-4 with CD80/86.

Clinical Development in North America
 In August 2022, we announced that the FDA had approved the IND application for the initiation of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of YH001 in combination with envafolimab and doxorubicin, an approved treatment for soft tissue sarcoma, for the treatment of sarcoma patients and in December 2022, we initiated dosing in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial. The Phase 1/2 trial will assess the safety and efficacy of the triplet combination of YH001, envafolimab and doxorubicin in the common sarcoma subtypes of leiomyosarcoma and dedifferentiated liposarcoma, and we expect Phase 1 data in the second half of 2023. In addition, the trial will assess the safety and efficacy of the doublet combination of YH001 and envafolimab in patients with the rare sarcoma subtypes of alveolar soft part sarcoma and chondrosarcoma. Additionally, we plan to initiate trials of YH001 as a single agent or in combination with immunotherapies in other tumor types.
Our Third Clinical Stage Product Candidate – TRC102
 
Overview of Base Excision Repair and the Mechanism of Action of TRC102
 Base-excision repair (BER) is a complex and fundamental cellular process used by cancer cells to repair the DNA damage caused by chemotherapeutics, especially the classes of chemotherapeutics known as alkylating agents, including Temodar, dacarbazine and bis-dichloroethyl-nitrosourea (BCNU), and anti-metabolite agents, including Fludara and Alimta. The process of BER removes DNA bases damaged by chemotherapy, resulting in the formation of gaps in the DNA strand called apurinic and apyrimidinic (AP) sites. The appropriate base is then inserted in this gap to restore the proper tumor DNA sequence. By this process, cancer cells can circumvent the anti-tumor effects of chemotherapy.
 Inhibition of BER has been proposed as a way to improve the efficacy of chemotherapeutics; however, to our knowledge, no inhibitors of BER have been tested in clinical trials. We are developing TRC102 (methoxyamine hydrochloride) to reverse resistance to specific chemotherapeutics by inhibiting BER. TRC102 interrupts BER by rapidly and covalently binding within AP sites, converting the AP site to a substrate for the enzyme topoisomerase II, which cleaves TRC102-bound DNA, resulting in an accumulation of DNA strand breaks that trigger cellular apoptosis, or programmed cell death, as illustrated in the figure below:
 
18





TRC102 binding results in apoptosis
 
The induction of apoptosis by TRC102 is relatively selective for cancer cells, which typically overexpress topoisomerase II. In nonmalignant cells with low topoisomerase II expression, TRC102-bound DNA is excised and replaced by a separate DNA repair system.
 In November 2020, we announced the publication of clinical data in the journal Cancer Cell that provides molecular insight into TRC102’s mechanism of action and patient populations most likely to respond to treatment. The article, entitled, “Molecular Features of Cancers Exhibiting Exceptional Responses to Treatment,” highlighted the clinical features and tumor biology of an exceptional responder patient treated with TRC102 at the NCI. The patient was diagnosed with metastatic and highly refractory CRC and received Temodar and TRC102. Following treatment, the patient was considered an exceptional responder through the achievement of a near complete response lasting 45 months at the most recent follow-up. Detailed molecular analyses of the patient’s tumor showed silencing of DNA repair pathways that may have resulted in sensitivity to the inhibition of DNA BER pathway by TRC102. Specifically, MGMT expression was silenced by promoter methylation, and RAD50, a mediator of DNA double strand break repair, was silenced by genetic mutation and loss of heterozygosity. The publication authors hypothesized that the combination of Temodar and TRC102 was effective because all necessary DNA repair pathways were compromised genetically or through the activity of TRC102. MGMT expression was also assessed in biopsies from 11 colorectal patients who subsequently enrolled in an expansion cohort, one of whom demonstrated a PR. The tumor associated with the PR did not express MGMT, whereas each of the 10 tumors that did not respond to therapy expressed this enzyme robustly. MGMT deficiency is observed in about one third of glioblastoma patients, and a prior study of Temodar and TRC102 reported at the Society for Neuro-Oncology in 2018 demonstrated that two MGMT deficient glioblastoma patients had prolonged survival when treated with Temodar and TRC102 after progressing previously on Temodar and radiation therapy. Based on these data, we believe a trial in first line glioblastoma patients of Temodar, radiation therapy and TRC102 is warranted and are discussing further development with investigators at this time.

TRC102 Development in Oncology
 TRC102 is being developed to reverse resistance to Temodar, an alkylating chemotherapeutic, as well as to Alimta and Fludara, two antimetabolite chemotherapeutics. We consider it advantageous to combine TRC102 with Alimta because Alimta is approved in one large market indication (lung cancer) and one orphan drug indication (mesothelioma). Temodar is an approved chemotherapeutic used as a standard of care agent to treat glioblastoma, and Fludara is an approved chemotherapeutic used as a standard of care agent to treat lymphoma and leukemia. In initial clinical trials of more than 100 patients, TRC102 has shown good tolerability and promising anti-tumor activity in combination with alkylating and antimetabolite chemotherapy.
 We filed an IND application for TRC102 in March 2008, Case Western filed an IND application for TRC102 in March 2006, and NCI filed an IND for TRC102 in March 2013, all for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors. The IND application filed by NCI cross references our IND application.
 The following table summarizes certain key information regarding ongoing clinical trials of TRC102 in cancer patients:
  
 | | | Companion | Design 
------+-----------------------------------------+---------+-----------------------------+---------------------------------
Phase | Indication | Sponsor | Treatment | (Number of Patients) 
1 | Solid Tumors and Lymphomas | NCI | Temodar | Dose escalation (65) 
2 | Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer | NCI | Chemoradiation + Durvalumab | Randomized Phase 2 (78 patients)

 
In May 2020, positive data from multiple TRC102 clinical trials were presented at the 2020 ASCO Virtual Scientific Program.  Dr. Koczywas of City of Hope Medical Center presented Phase 1 data for TRC102 in combination with cisplatin and Alimta in patients with advanced solid tumors, and Phase 2 data for TRC102 in combination with Alimta in patients with mesothelioma refractory to Alimta and platinum therapy. Notably two of 14 mesothelioma patients who progressed previously on Alimta had objective responses following treatment with Alimta and TRC102.  Multiple responses were also noted in the Phase 1 trial of Alimta, cisplatin and TRC102, with particular activity noted in parotid salivary gland tumors. Dr. Biswas of Case Comprehensive Cancer Center presented Phase 1 data of TRC102 in combination with chemoradiation for locally advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.  All 15 patients demonstrated an objective response, including three patients with a complete response to treatment.  The 100% ORR compares favorably to historical data of the same combination of chemoradiation without TRC102 in locally advanced lung cancer.  For example, the PROCLAIM clinical trial reported an ORR of 36% and the PACIFIC clinical trial reported an ORR of 51% in locally advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with Alimta, cisplatin and thoracic radiation. In addition, based on data presented at the ASCO 2020 virtual meeting that the combination of chemoradiation and TRC102 produced objective responses in all 15 evaluable patients with advanced localized lung cancer treated in a Phase 1 trial, in January 2022, the NCI initiated a randomized trial of chemoradiation with or without TRC102, followed by consolidative durvalumab treatment. The primary objective is to improve the 56% PFS rate with current standard of care to 75% with current standard of care plus TRC102. The trial began enrollment in June 2022 and is expected to be complete in 2025. 
 Phase 1 ascending dose clinical trials evaluating the safety, tolerability, PK, PD and anti-tumor activity of TRC102 were completed with Alimta in patients with advanced solid tumors, with Fludara in patients with hematologic malignancy and with Temodar in patients with solid tumors. In each trial, TRC102 was tolerable with the companion chemotherapeutic, and demonstrated signs of activity.  One patient treated with TRC102 and Alimta had a PR as assessed by RECIST 1.1 and remained in our clinical trial without cancer progression for 14 months. In addition, 14 patients had SD including patients with squamous cell lung cancer (three patients), epithelial ovarian cancer (three patients), CRC (two patients), non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (one patient), pancreatic cancer (one patient), prostate cancer (one patient), endometrial cancer (one patient), head and neck cancer (one patient) and breast cancer (one patient). These data were published in Investigational New Drugs in 2012. Case Western reported data from a trial of intravenous TRC102 given in combination with Fludara in a Phase 1 clinical trial that were published in Oncotarget in 2017. Anti-tumor activity, including PR, was noted in patients with lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, including patients treated previously with Fludara. TRC102 combined with Fludara was safe and well tolerated. Hematologic toxicity was comparable to single agent Fludara and activity appeared to correlate with increased levels of DNA damage. Case Western reported data from a trial of TRC102 given intravenously in combination with Temodar in a Phase 1 clinical trial at the ASCO annual meeting in June 2015. Anti-tumor activity was noted in patients with ovarian cancer and neuroendocrine tumors.
 The NCI reported data from the Phase 1 trial of TRC102 in combination with Temodar in relapsed solid tumors and lymphoma patients at ASCO in 2017. There were no pharmacologic interactions between the two drugs and TRC102 target concentrations were achieved. Based on PRs in patients with ovarian cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and KRAS-positive CRC, the NCI decided to enroll expansion cohorts in each of these tumor types at the recommended Phase 2 oral dose of TRC102.  The authors concluded that the combination of Temodar and TRC102 is active, and DNA damage response markers (Rad51, ϒ-H2AX and/or pNbs1) were induced in four of five paired colonic biopsies, indicating DNA damage following treatment.  Updated data in the cohort of patients with CRC reported by the NCI at AACR in 2019 indicated a low response rate in patients with CRC treated with Temodar and TRC102.
 20


The combination of TRC102 and Temodar was assessed in a Phase 2 trial of patients with recurrent glioblastoma that was reported at the Society for Neuro-Oncology annual meeting in November 2018.  The combination of Temodar and TRC102 was tolerable, but did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint of demonstrating objective responses by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria in the 19 enrolled patients, most of whom were treated at Cleveland Clinic.  Two patients (10.5%) demonstrated evidence of clinical benefit and met the secondary endpoint of PFS beyond six months.  Both patients who demonstrated PFS for more than 11 months were alive over 30 months following treatment initiation with TRC102 and Temodar for recurrent glioblastoma.  PFS of greater than 11 months was associated with N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase expression, a biomarker that initiates the BER pathway of resistance that is inhibited by TRC102. Efforts to identify whether DNA glycosylase expression or other biomarkers can be used as a predictive biomarker of TRC102 activity are expected to continue in ongoing TRC102.

Our Fourth Clinical Stage Product Candidate – TJ004309
 TJ004309, is a novel, humanized antibody against CD73, an ecto-enzyme expressed on stromal cells and tumors that converts extracellular AMP to the immunosuppressive metabolite adenosine. In December 2018, we submitted an IND application to the FDA for the initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors, which was cleared by the FDA in January 2019. In July 2019, we began enrollment in a Phase 1 clinical trial to assess safety and preliminary efficacy of TJ004309 as a single agent and when combined with the PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor Tecentriq® in patients with advanced solid tumors, and in June 2021 we presented data from the ongoing Phase 1 trial at the ASCO 2021 virtual meeting. In a poster presentation titled “The safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and clinical efficacy of uliledlimab (TJ004309), a differentiated CD73 antibody, in combination with atezolizumab in patients with advanced cancer,” uliledlimab was found to be well-tolerated up to 20mg/kg every three weeks and 15mg/kg once weekly as a monotherapy and in combination therapy with atezolizumab 1200mg every three weeks and no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed and the maximum tolerated dose  (MTD) was not reached. There was one complete response in a PD-(L)1 naïve patient, two partial responses (PRs) with one PR in a PD-(L)1 naïve patient and one PR in a PD-(L)1 refractory patient, and three cases of stable disease (SD) following treatment with uliledlimab and atezolizumab.
Collaboration and License Agreements
 Collaboration Agreement with 3D Medicines and Alphamab
 In December 2019, we, 3D Medicines, and Alphamab entered into the Envafolimab Collaboration Agreement for the development of envafolimab, an investigational PD-L1 sdAb, or nanobody, administered by rapid subcutaneous injection, for the treatment of sarcoma in North America. 
 Pursuant to the Envafolimab Collaboration Agreement, we were granted an exclusive license to develop and commercialize envafolimab for the treatment of sarcoma in North America.

 We will be responsible for commercializing envafolimab for sarcoma in North America, including booking of sales revenue, unless (a) envafolimab is first approved in North America for an indication other than sarcoma and launched in North America, or (b) envafolimab is first approved in North America for sarcoma and subsequently approved in North America for an additional non-orphan indication and sold commercially by 3D Medicines and/or Alphamab, or licensee, in which case 3D Medicines and Alphamab will be responsible for commercializing envafolimab for sarcoma in North America, including booking of sales revenue. If 3D Medicines and Alphamab become responsible for commercialization under the Envafolimab Collaboration Agreement, we have the option to co-market envafolimab for sarcoma in North America. In the event that envafolimab is first approved in North America for sarcoma and within three years of the commercial launch of envafolimab in North America for sarcoma 3D Medicines and Alphamab replace us as the party responsible for commercialization, and we elect and 3D Medicines and Alphamab agree for us to not co-market envafolimab for sarcoma in North America, then 3D Medicines and Alphamab will be required to compensate us for our costs associated with preparing for and conducting commercial activities.
 If we have the responsibility for commercialization under the Envafolimab Collaboration Agreement, we will owe 3D Medicines and Alphamab tiered double digit royalties on net sales of envafolimab for sarcoma in North America ranging from the teens to mid-double digits.  If 3D Medicines and Alphamab have responsibility for commercialization under the Envafolimab Collaboration Agreement, we will be entitled to (a) tiered double digit royalties on net sales of envafolimab for sarcoma in North America ranging from the teens to mid-double digits if we have elected to not co-market envafolimab in sarcoma or (b) a 50% royalty on net sales of envafolimab for sarcoma in North America if we have chosen to co-market envafolimab in sarcoma.  Payment obligations under the Envafolimab Collaboration Agreement continue on a country-by-country basis until the last to expire licensed patent covering envafolimab expires.

3D Medicines and Alphamab retain the right to reacquire the rights to envafolimab for sarcoma in North America in connection with an arm’s length sale to a third party of the rights to develop and commercialize envafolimab in North America for all indications, provided that the sale may not occur prior to completion of a pivotal trial of envafolimab in sarcoma without our written consent and the parties must negotiate in good faith and agree to fair compensation be paid to us for the value of and opportunity represented by the reacquired rights.
 Each party agreed that during the term of the Envafolimab Collaboration Agreement, it would not develop or license from any third party a monospecific inhibitor to PD-L1 or PD-1 in sarcoma.
 The term of the Envafolimab Collaboration Agreement continues until the later of the date the parties cease further development and commercialization of envafolimab for sarcoma in North America or the expiration of all payment obligations.  The Envafolimab Collaboration Agreement may be terminated earlier by a party in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party or bankruptcy of the other party, or for safety reasons related to envafolimab.  In the event we elect, or a joint steering committee (JSC) determines, to cease further development or commercialization of envafolimab, or if we fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop (including progress in clinical trials) and commercialize envafolimab and do not cure such failure within a specified time period, then our rights and obligations under the Envafolimab Collaboration Agreement will revert to 3D Medicines and Alphamab.
 Collaboration Agreement with Eucure and Biocytogen
 In October 2021, we, Eucure and Biocytogen entered into a collaborative development and commercialization agreement (the YH001 Collaboration Agreement) for the development of YH001, a monospecific investigational CTLA-4 antibody. Pursuant to the YH001 Collaboration Agreement, we were granted an exclusive (including with respect to Eucure and its affiliates), nontransferable, license to develop and commercialize YH001 in North America for the treatment, through administration of YH001 by intravenous or subcutaneous means, of multiple human indications, including sarcoma, microsatellite stable colorectal cancer, RCC, and K-ras positive non-small cell lung cancer (collectively, the Initial Indications) or one or more of bladder cancer, endometrial cancer, and melanoma as substitute indications, which may be substituted for Initial Indications at our discretion (each upon such substitution, a Substitute Indication). We are responsible for, and will bear the costs of, preparing and filing all regulatory submissions and conducting any Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, or post-approval clinical trials in North America for YH001 in the Initial Indications and potentially the Substitute Indications, while Eucure is responsible for conducting, and will bear the costs of, the preparation of CMC activities for YH001. Eucure has agreed to manufacture and supply, or to arrange for a third-party manufacturer to manufacture and supply, YH001 to us for clinical trials pursuant to the terms of a clinical supply and quality agreement that will be separately negotiated and agreed in good faith between the parties. 
 Eucure may pursue clinical trials for YH001 in North America outside of the Initial Indications or Substitute Indications, and also within the Initial Indications or Substitute Indications as part of a combination therapy of YH001 and an additional Eucure product. During a specified period, we have the option, subject to Eucure’s prior written approval, to expand the license to include the development and commercialization of YH001 for the treatment, through administration by intravenous or subcutaneous means, of all human and veterinary therapeutic indications in North America for a payment to Eucure in the low single digit millions (the Company Option).
 Pursuant to the YH001 Collaboration Agreement, we granted Eucure an irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free, exclusive license, with the right to grant sublicenses to develop, register, sell, offer to sell, have sold, market and distribute YH001 in all territories outside of North America as well as within North America for all indications other than the Initial Indications and the Substitute Indications.  
 We will be responsible for commercializing YH001 in North America, including booking of sales revenue in the Initial and Substitute Indications. We will owe Eucure escalating double digit royalties on net sales of YH001 in North America ranging from the mid-twenties to mid-double digits; provided that until the end of the first full calendar year following the first commercial sale of YH001, royalties will range from the lower double digits to the mid-double digits. If sales of YH001 exceed a pre-determined sales threshold in the first full year of sales following first commercial sale, we will owe a milestone to Eucure in the high single digit millions. Payment obligations under the YH001 Collaboration Agreement continue on a country-by-country basis until the latest of (i) expiration of the last to expire licensed patent covering YH001, (ii) expiration of marketing or regulatory exclusivity covering YH001 and (iii) 10 years from the first commercial sale of YH001 in such country in North America. Eucure has agreed to manufacture and supply, or to arrange for a third-party manufacturer to manufacture and supply, YH001 to us at cost plus a low double-digit markup for commercial sales pursuant to the terms of a commercial supply and quality agreement that will be separately negotiated and agreed in good faith between the parties within 180 days prior to the anticipated first commercial sale in North America.
 Pursuant to the YH001 Collaboration Agreement, each party agreed that during the term of the YH001 Collaboration Agreement, it would not develop, manufacture, commercialize or license from any third party a monospecific inhibitor to CTLA-4. 
 22


The term of the YH001 Collaboration Agreement continues until the earlier of (i) the date that the parties cease further development and commercialization of YH001 in North America or (ii) on a country-by-county basis, the expiration of the royalty obligations in such country.  The YH001 Collaboration Agreement may be terminated earlier by a party in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party or bankruptcy of the other party, or for safety reasons related to YH001. In the event of a termination of the YH001 Collaboration Agreement, other than by us as a result of Eucure’s material uncured breach or bankruptcy, (i) our license shall terminate and (ii) we would be obligated to grant Eucure an irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive license with the right to grant sublicenses under its rights in all development data and intellectual property to develop, register, sell, offer to sell, have sold, market and distribute YH001 in North America. In the event of a termination of the YH001 Collaboration Agreement by us as a result of Eucure’s material uncured breach or bankruptcy, the license shall continue in the Initial Indications in North America, provided that (i) such license shall remain exclusive during the royalty term and non-exclusive thereafter; (ii) we shall have the right to have YH001 manufactured for its development and commercialization requirements in the Initial Indications in North America; and (iii) the license shall terminate in the event of an uncured material breach by us of any provision (including payment obligations) that survives termination of the YH001 Collaboration Agreement.  In the event the YH001 Collaboration Agreement terminates for safety reasons related to YH001, by mutual agreement of the parties or by Eucure in the event of an uncured material breach or bankruptcy by us, then our rights and obligations under the YH001 Collaboration Agreement will revert to Eucure.  In the event Eucure does not approve the Company Option, we may terminate the YH001 Collaboration Agreement for convenience with a 30-day notice to Eucure, provided that such termination is given within 12 months of the effective date of the YH001 Collaboration Agreement (the Company Option Termination).  In the event of a Company Option Termination, Eucure would be obligated to reimburse us for all costs and expenses that we incurred in performing the development activities.
 Collaboration Agreements with I-Mab Biopharma 
 In November 2018, we entered into two separate strategic collaboration and clinical trial agreements with I-Mab for the development of multiple immuno-oncology programs, including I-Mab’s proprietary CD73 antibody TJ004309 as well as up to five proprietary bispecific antibodies currently under development by I-Mab.
 In the TJ004309 Agreement, we are collaborating with I-Mab on developing TJ004309, and will bear the costs of filing an IND application and for Phase 1 clinical trials, share costs equally for Phase 2 clinical trials, and we will bear 40% and I-Mab 60% of the costs for pivotal clinical trials. I-Mab will also be responsible for the cost of certain non-clinical activities and the supply of TJ004309 and any reference drugs used in the development activities. We also agreed with I-Mab for a specified period of time to not develop or license to or from a third party any monoclonal antibody targeting CD73 or any other biologic for certain indications that a JSC, as set up under the TJ004309 Agreement, selects for TJ004309 development.
 In the event that I-Mab licenses rights to TJ004309 to a third party, we would be entitled to receive escalating portions of royalty and non-royalty consideration received by I-Mab with respect to territories outside of Greater China. In the event that I-Mab commercializes TJ004309, we would be entitled to receive a royalty on net sales by I-Mab in North America ranging from the mid-single digits to low double digits, and in the EU and Japan in the mid-single digits. The portions of certain third party royalty and non-royalty consideration and the royalty from net sales by I-Mab to which we would be entitled escalate based on the phase of development and relevant clinical trial obligations we complete under the TJ004309 Agreement, ranging from a high-single digit to a mid-teen percentage of non-royalty consideration as well as a double digit percentage of royalty consideration. In March 2020, I-Mab issued a press release announcing a strategic partnership with KG Bio, whereby KG Bio received what the press release described as a right of first negotiation outside North America for TJ004309 for up to $340 million in potential payments to I-Mab. On April 8, 2020, we issued a notice of dispute regarding possible breach of the TJ004309 Agreement, which resulted in a binding arbitration proceeding under the Rules of Arbitration of the ICC before the Tribunal. The latest developments in the dispute with I-Mab are discussed in more detail below following the discussion of the Bispecific Agreement.
 The TJ004309 Agreement may be terminated by either party in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party or bankruptcy of the other party, or for safety reasons related to TJ004309.  I-Mab may also terminate the TJ004309 Agreement if we cause certain delays in completing a Phase 1 clinical trial. In addition, I-Mab may terminate the TJ004309 Agreement for any reason within 90 days following the completion of the first Phase 1 clinical trial, in which case we would be entitled to a minimum termination fee of $9.0 million, or following the completion of the first Phase 2 clinical trial, in which case we would be entitled to a pre-specified termination fee of $15.0 million and either a percentage of non-royalty consideration I-Mab may receive as part of a license to a third party or an additional payment if TJ004309 is approved for marketing outside Greater China before a third party license is executed, in addition to a double digit percentage of royalty consideration. In 2021, I-Mab sent us notices purporting to terminate the TJ004309 Agreement, which would result in I-Mab owing us a prespecified termination fee of $9.0 million. However, I-Mab does not have an option to terminate the TJ004309 Agreement without cause until the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of TJ004309 is “Complete,” as that term is defined in the TJ004309 Agreement, and we responded by disputing the basis for I-Mab’s termination. In March 2021, I-Mab filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery seeking an order of specific performance requiring us to comply with I-Mab’s effort to terminate the agreement. We disagreed with I-Mab’s position and in May 2021, the Delaware Court of Chancery stayed the lawsuit filed by I-Mab and subsequently this matter was remanded and included in the proceeding before the Tribunal.
 Pursuant to the Bispecific Agreement, we and I-Mab may mutually select through a JSC up to five of I-Mab’s BsAb product candidates within a five-year period for development and commercialization in North America. 
 23


For each product candidate selected by the JSC for development under the Bispecific Agreement, I-Mab will be responsible and bear the costs for IND-enabling studies and establishing manufacturing for the product candidate, we will be responsible for and bear the costs of filing an IND and conducting Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, and we will be responsible for and will share equally with I-Mab in the costs of conducting Phase 3 or pivotal clinical trials, in each case within North America. Subject to I-Mab’s right to co-promote an approved product candidate, we will be responsible for commercializing any approved product candidates in North America, and we will share profits and losses equally with I-Mab in North America. We would also be entitled to receive tiered low single digit royalties on net sales of product candidates in the EU and Japan.
 At any time prior to completing the first pivotal clinical trial for a product candidate or if I-Mab ceases to support development costs or pay its portion of Phase 3 clinical trial costs for a product candidate or the JSC decides to cease development over our objections after initiating Phase 3 clinical trials, we will have an option to obtain an exclusive license to such product candidate in all territories except Greater China and Korea and any other territories in which I-Mab previously licensed rights to a third party subject to our right of first refusal for any licenses I-Mab may grant to third-parties.  
 If we exercise our licensing option, we would assume sole responsibility for developing and commercializing the product candidate in the licensed territory, and in lieu of profit or loss sharing with I-Mab with respect to such product candidate, we would owe I-Mab pre-specified upfront and milestone payments and royalties on net sales, with the payments and royalties escalating depending on the phase of development the product candidate reached at the time we obtained the exclusive license as follows: (i) if before IND-enabling studies and the preparation of the CMC activities of the collaborative product, we would owe I-Mab a one-time upfront payment of $10.0 million, development and regulatory based milestone payments totaling up to $90.0 million that begin upon completion of a pivotal trial, sales milestones totaling up to $250.0 million, and royalties in the mid-single digits on annual net sales; (ii) if after IND submission but before completion of a Phase 1a clinical trial of the collaborative product, we would owe I-Mab a one-time upfront payment of $25.0 million, development and regulatory based milestone payments totaling up to $125.0 million that begin upon completion of a pivotal trial, sales milestones totaling up to $250.0 million, and royalties in the high single digits on annual net sales; (iii) if after completion of a Phase 1a clinical trial but before completion of a Phase 2 proof of concept clinical trial for the collaborative product, we would owe I-Mab a one-time upfront payment of $50.0 million, development and regulatory based milestone payments totaling up to $250.0 million that begin upon completion of a pivotal trial, sales milestones totaling up to $250.0 million, and royalties in the low double digits on annual net sales; and (iv) if after completion of a Phase 2 proof of concept clinical trial and before completion of a pivotal trial for the collaborative product, we would owe I-Mab a one-time upfront payment of $80.0 million, development and regulatory based milestone payments totaling up to $420.0 million that begin upon completion of a pivotal trial, sales milestones totaling up to $250.0 million, and royalties in the high-teens on annual net sales.
 Each party agreed that for a specified period of time, it would not develop or license to or from any third party any bispecific monoclonal antibody targeting the same two biological targets as those of any selected product candidates under the Bispecific Agreement.
 If development of any selected product candidates is terminated by a decision of the JSC, all rights to the product candidate will revert to I-Mab, subject to our rights to obtain an exclusive license in certain circumstances.  If development is terminated after submission of an IND and prior to initiating Phase 3 clinical studies or after initiating Phase 3 clinical studies and with our concurrence, we would be entitled to tiered low single digit royalties on net sales of the product candidate in North America, the EU and Japan.
 The Bispecific Agreement may be terminated by either party in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party or bankruptcy of the other party, or with respect to any selected product candidate, for safety reasons related to that product candidate.
 In March 2020, we learned that I-Mab had entered into two license and collaboration agreements with ABL Bio in July 2018. Under ABL Bio License 1, I-Mab granted to ABL Bio exclusive, worldwide (excluding Greater China), royalty-bearing rights to develop and commercialize a BsAb using certain monoclonal antibody sequences. Under ABL License 2, I-Mab and ABL agreed to collaborate to develop three PD-L1-based bispecific antibodies by using ABL Bio’s proprietary BsAb technology and commercialize them in their respective territories, which, collectively, include China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and South Korea, and other territories throughout the rest of the world if both parties agree to do so in such other territories during the performance of the agreement. 
 24


In June 2020, I-Mab commenced an arbitration proceeding under the Rules of Arbitration of the ICC before the Tribunal after we invoked contractual dispute resolution provisions asserting that I-Mab had breached its contractual obligations concerning the TJ004309 Agreement and Bispecific Agreement. We filed counterclaims in the arbitration seeking to recover over $200 million in damages from I-Mab based on I-Mab’s breaches of the two strategic collaboration and clinical trial agreements. The Tribunal held a hearing on the merits in February 2022, and final post-hearing briefs were submitted by us and I-Mab in May 2022. On November 8, 2022, the Tribunal invited the parties to submit additional, limited briefing on two discrete issues by December 9, 2022. Following that submission, the parties submitted their respective cost submissions for attorney fees reimbursement in January 2023. The Tribunal did not indicate when it expects to render its final decision; however, it did note that it was far along in its deliberations and preparation of a final award. Under the applicable rules of the arbitration, the prevailing party may be awarded attorneys’ fees at the Tribunal’s discretion. As of the date of this Annual Report, the TJ004309 Agreement and Bispecific Agreement disputes remain under consideration by the Tribunal, and we expect the Tribunal to render its final decision in the first quarter of 2023. The claims under the arbitration are complex; accordingly, we cannot predict the outcome of the arbitration, and we are unable to estimate the amount of recovery or damages, if any, that may be awarded by the Tribunal. The dispute with I-Mab has caused, and could continue to cause, us to incur significant costs.
 License Agreement with Case Western
 In August 2006, we entered into a license agreement with Case Western, under which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to certain patents, know-how and other intellectual property controlled by Case Western related to methoxyamine, which we refer to as the TRC102 Technology. Under the agreement, as amended, we have the right to use, manufacture and commercialize products utilizing the TRC102 Technology for all mammalian therapeutic uses, and to sublicense these rights.
 Under the agreement, we are generally obligated to use our best efforts to commercialize the TRC102 Technology as soon as possible. We are also required to meet specified diligence milestones, and if we fail to do so and do not cure such failure, Case Western may convert our license into a non-exclusive license or terminate the agreement.
 In consideration of the rights granted to us under the agreement, we paid a one-time upfront fee to Case Western. In addition, we may be required to pay up to an aggregate of approximately $9.8 million in milestone payments, of which $0.7 million relates to the initiation of certain development activities and approximately $9.1 million relates to the submission of certain regulatory filings and receipt of certain regulatory approvals. If products utilizing the TRC102 Technology are successfully commercialized, we will be required to pay Case Western a single-digit royalty on net sales, subject to adjustments in certain circumstances. Beginning on the earlier of a specified number of years from the effective date of the agreement and the anniversary of the effective date following the occurrence of a specified event, we will be required to make a minimum annual royalty payment of $75,000, which will be credited against our royalty obligations. In the event we sublicense any of our rights under the agreement relating to the TRC102 Technology, we will be obligated to pay Case Western a portion of certain fees we may receive under the sublicense. Our royalty obligations will continue through the later of (i) the expiration of any orphan drug marketing exclusivity for a product utilizing the TRC102 Technology, (ii) August 2026, or (iii) on a country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the last valid claim under the TRC102 Technology or any patent we receive that is a derivative of the TRC102 Technology.
 We may unilaterally terminate this agreement in its entirety, for any reason or for no reason, upon at least 30 days’ notice to Case Western. If we do so, we will be required to pay Case Western a termination fee. If we fail to pay any amount required under the agreement and do not cure the default within 90 days of receiving notice, Case Western will have the right to convert our exclusive license to a non-exclusive license or to terminate the agreement entirely. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of the other party’s material breach of the agreement that remains uncured 60 days after receiving notice of the breach.
 Cooperative Research and Development Agreements with NCI
 We are a party to a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as represented by NCI, for the development of TRC102 for the treatment of cancer. We entered into the CRADA governing the development of TRC102 (TRC102 CRADA) in August 2012 with NCI’s Center for Cancer Research. 
 Under the CRADA, as amended, NCI conducts clinical trials and non-clinical studies of TRC102. Pursuant the TRC102 CRADA, we are required to pay NCI $20,000 per year per Phase 1 clinical trial and $25,000 per year per Phase 2 clinical trial, as well as expenses incurred by NCI in connection with carrying out its responsibilities under the TRC102 CRADA, up to an aggregate maximum per year of $200,000. We may also provide funding to support assays and other studies, and if NCI supplies TRC102 for additional mutually approved clinical trials beyond the planned trials, we will reimburse NCI for costs associated with manufacturing TRC102. In addition, we made a one-time payment of $20,000 for the initial IND filing and may be required to make additional one-time payments of $10,000 each for additional IND filings. Funding for clinical trials beyond those contemplated by the TRC102 CRADA will be determined in an amendment to the applicable CRADA.
 25


Under the CRADA, each party individually owns all inventions, data and materials produced solely by its employees in the course of performing research activities pursuant to the CRADA. The parties jointly own any inventions and materials that are jointly produced by employees of both parties. Subject to certain conditions, we have the option under the CRADA to negotiate commercialization licenses from the government to intellectual property conceived or first reduced to practice in performance of the CRADA research plan that was developed solely by NCI employees or jointly by us and NCI employees.
 The TRC102 CRADA had an original five-year term and was subsequently amended to extend the term to August 7, 2023. The CRADA may be terminated at any time by mutual written consent, and we or NCI may unilaterally terminate the CRADA for any reason or no reason by providing written notice at least 60 days before the desired termination date.
 Manufacturing
 We do not own or operate, nor do we expect to own or operate, facilities for product manufacturing, storage, distribution or testing. We contract with third parties or our collaboration partners for the manufacture of our product candidates and we intend to continue to do so in the future. 
 Envafolimab is manufactured by AlphaMab in China and fill finish is performed by a contract manufacturer in the United States. Pursuant to the Envafolimab Collaboration Agreement, 3D Medicines and Alphamab have agreed to manufacture and supply, or to arrange for a third party manufacturer to manufacture and supply, envafolimab to us at pre-negotiated prices that vary based on clinical or commercial use.
 YH001 is manufactured by an experienced contract manufacturer in China. Pursuant to the YH001 Collaboration Agreement, Eucure and Biocytogen have agreed to manufacture and supply, or to arrange for a third party manufacturer to manufacture and supply, YH001 to us at pre-negotiated prices that vary based on clinical or commercial use pursuant to the terms of a clinical supply and quality agreement to be separately negotiated.
 TRC102 drug substance is manufactured through a standard chemical synthesis and may be obtained from multiple manufacturers.
 TJ004309 is supplied to us from a contract manufacturer contracted by I-Mab as I-Mab is responsible for the supply of TJ004309 and all related drug supply activities under the terms of the TJ004309 Agreement.
 Competition
 The development and commercialization of new drugs is highly competitive, and we and our collaborators face competition with respect to each of our product candidates in their target indications. Many of the entities developing and marketing potentially competing products have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources and expertise than we do in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop.
 If our product candidates are approved, they will compete with currently marketed drugs and therapies used for treatment of the following indications, and potentially with drug candidates currently in development for the same indications.
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of any approved product will include its efficacy, safety profile, price, method of administration and level of promotional activity.
 Oncology Therapies
 There is no PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of sarcoma. Keytruda (marketed by Merck) has a compendia listing for the treatment of UPS, and is used off-label for the treatment of patients with UPS. If envafolimab is approved, it may nevertheless compete with currently marketed PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors, including Opdivo (marketed by BMS), Keytruda (marketed by Merck), Imfinzi (marketed by AstraZeneca), and Tecentriq (marketed by Roche) which are approved by the FDA in multiple indications other than soft tissue sarcoma. The global PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors market had an approximate value of over $30 billion in 2022.
 There is no CTLA-4 therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma.  If YH001 is approved, it may nevertheless compete with the currently marketed CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab (Yervoy, marketed by BMS), which is approved by the FDA in multiple indications other than soft tissue sarcoma. Other antibodies to CTLA-4 are being studied in clinical trials of cancer patients.
 26


We are developing TRC102 to be used in combination with alkylating chemotherapeutics (including Temodar) and antimetabolite chemotherapeutics (including Alimta and Fludara) for the treatment of cancer. If TRC102 is approved, it could compete with other inhibitors of DNA repair. Tesaro, Inc. (now GSK), Clovis Oncology and Astra Zeneca each market inhibitors of DNA repair that work by a mechanism of action that is distinct from that of TRC102. In addition to the therapies mentioned above, there are many generic chemotherapeutics and other regimens commonly used to treat various types of cancer, including soft tissue sarcoma and glioblastoma.
 We are developing TJ004309 for the treatment of solid tumors. If TJ004309 is approved, it could compete with other anti-CD73 immunotherapies including CD73 antibodies as well as adenosine receptor inhibitors already in clinical development sponsored by BMS, AstraZeneca, Arcus Biosciences and Corvus Pharmaceuticals. 
 Commercialization
 We hold North America commercialization rights in the field of sarcoma for envafolimab (subject to certain rights held by 3D Medicines and Alphamab), North America commercialization rights of multiple human indications, including the Initial Indications or one or more of the Substitute Indications, which may be substituted for Initial Indications at our discretion, for YH001, and worldwide commercialization rights for TRC102. If any of our product candidates are approved in oncology indications, our plan is to build an oncology-focused specialty sales force in the United States to support their commercialization and seek a partner(s) to support commercialization outside the United States to the extent we have commercial rights in other territories. We believe that a specialty sales force will be sufficient to target key prescribing physicians in oncology. We currently do not have any sales or marketing capabilities or experience as a company. We plan to establish the required capabilities within an appropriate time frame ahead of any product approval and commercialization to support a product launch. 
Intellectual Property
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our protein therapeutics, novel biological discoveries, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Additionally, we expect to benefit from a variety of statutory frameworks in the United States, Europe, Japan and other countries that relate to the regulation of biosimilar molecules and orphan drug status. These statutory frameworks provide periods of non-patent-based exclusivity for qualifying molecules. See “Government Regulation.”
 Our patenting strategy is focused on our protein and small molecule therapeutics. We seek composition of matter and method of treatment patents for each such protein or small molecule in key therapeutic areas. We also seek patent protection with respect to companion diagnostic methods and compositions and treatments for targeted patient populations. We have sought patent protection alone or jointly with our collaborators, as dictated by our collaboration agreements. 
 Individual patents extend for varying periods of time depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued from applications filed in the United States are effective for twenty years from the earliest non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period; however, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also twenty years from the earliest international filing date. Our issued patents and pending applications with respect to our protein therapeutic candidates (excluding licensed rights) will expire on dates ranging from 2027 to 2030, exclusive of possible patent term extensions. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of extensions of patent term, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
 27


National and international patent laws concerning protein therapeutics remain highly unsettled. No consistent policy regarding the patent-eligibility or the breadth of claims allowed in such patents has emerged to date in the United States, Europe or other countries. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries can diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth or enforceability of claims that may be granted in our patents or in third-party patents. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our drugs and technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of the patent applications that we may file or license from third parties will result in the issuance of any patents. The issued patents that we own or may receive in the future, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may be able to independently develop and commercialize similar drugs or duplicate our technology, business model or strategy without infringing our patents. Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our drugs can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent. The patent positions for our most advanced programs are summarized below:
 Envafolimab Patent Coverage
 Specific to the development of envafolimab for the treatment of sarcoma in North America, we hold an exclusive license from 3D Medicines and Alphamab to any and all intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and know-how, claiming or covering envafolimab. We also hold a non-exclusive license for the conduct of clinical trials in the EU in support of the development of envafolimab for the treatment of sarcoma in North America. 3D Medicines and Alphamab retain ownership of any and all intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and know-how, claiming or covering any pharmaceutical composition or preparation comprising envafolimab.
YH001 Patent Coverage
 Eucure has an issued patent on the composition of matter and a pending application on the methods of use of YH001 in the United States. The terms of the patent would expire in 2037, exclusive of any patent term extension. We hold an exclusive (including with respect to Eucure and its affiliates), nontransferable, license to develop and commercialize YH001 in North America for the treatment, through administration of YH001 by intravenous or subcutaneous means, of multiple human indications, including the Initial Indications or one or more of the Substitute Indications, which may be substituted for Initial Indications at our discretion.  
TRC102 Patent Coverage
 We hold issued patents directed to combination of TRC102 and pemetrexed in the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, Mexico, Norway, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. We also have pending applications in other jurisdictions, including Brazil, China, Hong Kong, and India. The expected expiration date for these patents is 2027, exclusive of possible patent term extensions.
 We hold an issued patent on further combinations of TRC102 in Europe. The expected expiration date for these patents is 2031, exclusive of possible patent term extensions.
 TJ004309 Patent Coverage
 Specific to the development of TJ004309 in North America, we hold a non-exclusive license from I-Mab to any and all intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and know-how, claiming or covering any pharmaceutical composition or preparation comprising or containing TJ004309. I-Mab retains ownership of any and all intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and know-how, claiming or covering any pharmaceutical composition or preparation comprising or containing TJ004309.

 In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets, trademarks and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. In addition, we seek trademark protection in the United States and internationally where available and when we deem appropriate. Furthermore, we are a party to a number of license agreements under which we are granted intellectual property rights to know-how that are important to our business.
 U.S. Government Regulation
 The preclinical studies and clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and sales, among other things, of our product candidates and future products, are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, pharmaceutical products are regulated by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), in addition to the FDA’s implementing regulations. We expect envafolimab to be regulated by the FDA as a biologic, which requires the submission of a BLA and approval by the FDA prior to being marketed in the United States. We expect our small molecule product candidate TRC102 to be regulated as a drug and subject to New Drug Application, or NDA, requirements, which are substantially similar to the BLA requirements discussed below. Manufacturers of our product candidates may also be subject to state regulation. Failure to comply with FDA requirements, both before and after product approval, may subject us or our partners, contract manufacturers and suppliers to administrative or judicial sanctions, including FDA refusal to approve applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, fines and/or criminal prosecution.
 The steps required before a biologic may be approved for marketing of an indication in the United States generally include:
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLPs, and other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | completion of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, to establish that the biological product is “safe, pure and potent,” which is analogous to the safety and efficacy approval standard for a chemical drug product for its intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a marketing application;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with applicable current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements, or cGMPs; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review of the marketing application and issuance of a biologics license which is the approval necessary to market a biologic therapeutic product.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the biologic candidate. Preclinical studies must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations regarding GLPs. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Nonclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the preclinical testing, the IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase or phases of the clinical trial lends themselves to an efficacy determination. The IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA within the 30-day time period places the IND on clinical hold because of its concerns about the drug candidate or the conduct of the trial described in the clinical protocol included in the IND. The FDA can also place the IND on clinical hold at any time during drug development for safety concerns related to the investigational drug or to the class of products to which it belongs. The IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed.
 29


All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified principal investigators in accordance with GCPs. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the applicable phase of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors also must timely report to the FDA serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator’s brochure, or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug. An institutional review board, or IRB, at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution, approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each research subject or the subject’s legal representative, and monitor the trial until completed.
 Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap and different trials may be initiated with the same drug candidate within the same phase of development in similar or differing patient populations. Phase 1 clinical trials may be conducted in a limited number of patients, but are usually conducted in healthy volunteer subjects for indications other than oncology. The drug candidate is initially tested for safety and, as appropriate, for absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion, PD and PK.
 Phase 2 usually involves trials in a larger, but still limited, patient population to evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug candidate for specific, targeted indications to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and to identify possible short-term adverse effects and safety risks.
 Phase 3 trials are undertaken to further evaluate clinical efficacy of a specific endpoint and to test further for safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Phase 1, Phase 2, or Phase 3 testing might not be completed successfully within any specific time period, if at all, with respect to any of our product candidates. Results from one trial are not necessarily predictive of results from later trials. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 The results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the product, are submitted to the FDA as part of a marketing application requesting approval to market the drug candidate for a proposed indication. Under the PDUFA, the fees payable to the FDA for reviewing a marketing application, as well as annual program fees for approved products, can be substantial. The fees typically increase each year. Each marketing application submitted to the FDA for approval is reviewed for administrative completeness and reviewability within 60 days following receipt by the FDA of the application. If the application is found complete, the FDA will file the marketing application, triggering a full review of the application. The FDA may refuse to file any marketing application that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission. The FDA’s established goal is to review 90% of priority marketing applications within six months after the application is accepted for filing and 90% of standard marketing applications within 10 months of the acceptance date, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA, however, may not approve a drug candidate within these established goals and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. Further, the outcome of the review, even if generally favorable, may not be an actual approval but a “complete response letter” that describes additional work that must be done before the application can be approved. Before approving a marketing application, the FDA may inspect the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the facility complies with cGMPs. The FDA may deny approval of a marketing application if applicable statutory or regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or may require additional testing or information, which can extend the review process. FDA approval of any application may include many delays or never be granted. If a product is approved, the approval may impose limitations on the uses for which the product may be marketed, may require that warning statements be included in the product labeling, may require that additional studies be conducted following approval as a condition of the approval, and may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. The FDA must approve a marketing application supplement or a new marketing application before a product may be marketed for other uses or before certain manufacturing or other changes may be made. Further post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product is required. Also, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety or manufacturing problems occur following initial marketing. In addition, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development.
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (the BPCIA) created a pathway for licensure, or approval, of biological products that are biosimilar to, and possibly interchangeable with, earlier biological products licensed under the PHSA. Also under the BPCIA, innovator manufacturers of original reference biological products are granted 12 years of exclusivity before biosimilars can be approved for marketing in the United States. 
 Both before and after the FDA approves a product, the manufacturer and the holder or holders of the marketing application for the product are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight. For example, quality control and manufacturing procedures must conform, on an ongoing basis, to cGMP requirements, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to spend time, money and effort to maintain cGMP compliance.
 30


Additionally, the FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. However, physicians may, in their independent medical judgment, prescribe legally available products for off-label uses. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments but the FDA does restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
 Other Healthcare Laws
 Although we currently do not have any products on the market in the United States, we may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal, fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations, many of which may become more applicable if our product candidates are approved and we begin commercialization. For additional details regarding the federal, state and foreign healthcare laws that may affect our ability to operate, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry— “We are subject to extensive federal, state, and foreign regulation, and our failure to comply with these laws could harm our business.” If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, significant civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, imprisonment, and additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
Orphan Drug Act
 The United States Orphan Drug Act provides incentives to manufacturers to develop and market drugs for rare diseases and conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States at the time of application for orphan drug designation (ODD). ODD must be requested before submitting a BLA. ODD does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. If a product that has ODD subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the holder of the approval is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product except in very limited circumstances. For example, a drug that the FDA considers to be clinically superior to, or different from, another approved orphan drug, even though for the same indication, may also obtain approval in the United States during the seven-year exclusive marketing period. In addition, holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs are expected to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of marketing exclusivity for the drug.
 Legislation similar to the Orphan Drug Act has been enacted outside the United States, including in the EU and Japan. The orphan legislation in the EU is available for therapies addressing chronic debilitating or life-threatening conditions that affect five or fewer out of 10,000 persons or are financially not viable to develop. The market exclusivity period is for ten years, although that period can be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, available evidence establishes that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. The market exclusivity may be extended to 12 years if sponsors complete a pediatric investigation plan agreed upon with the relevant committee of the European Medicines Agency. Orphan legislation in Japan similarly provides for ten years of marketing exclusivity for drugs that are approved for the treatment of rare diseases and conditions.
Exclusivity
 New biological products will benefit, if approved, from the data exclusivity provisions legislated in the United States, the EU and Japan. All three regions effectively provide a period of data exclusivity to innovator biologic products. U.S. legislation provides a 12-year period of data exclusivity from the date of first licensure of a reference biologic product. EU legislation provides a period of 10 to 11 years and Japan legislation provides a period of 8 years during which companies cannot be granted approval as generic drugs to approved biologic therapies. Protection from generic competition is also available for new chemical entities, including potentially the small molecule TRC102, in the United States for 5 years, in the EU for 10 to 11 years and in Japan for 8 years.
 31


Exclusivity in the European Union
 The EU has led the way among the International Council for Harmonisation regions in establishing a regulatory framework for biosimilar products. The marketing authorization of generic medicinal products and similar biological medicinal products are governed in the EU by Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC (2001). Unlike generic medicinal products, which only need to demonstrate bioequivalence to an authorized reference product, similar biological medicinal products are required to submit preclinical and clinical data, the type and quantity of which is dictated by class and product specific guidelines. In order to submit a marketing authorization for a similar biological medicinal product, the reference product must have been authorized for marketing in the EU for at least 8 years. Biosimilars can only be authorized for use once the period of data exclusivity on the biological reference medicine has expired. In general, this means that the biological reference medicine must have been authorized for at least 10 years before a similar biological medicine can be made available by another company. The 10-year period can be extended to a maximum of 11 if, during the first 8 years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison to existing therapies.
 Many EU countries have banned interchangeability of biosimilars with their reference products to ensure adequate characterization of the safety profile of the biosimilar and to enable comparison to that of reference product.
 Exclusivity in Japan
 In 2009, Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, or MHLW, and Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device Agency, or PMDA, issued the first Japanese guidance on biosimilars. The guideline (currently available only in Japanese), which shares common key features to EU guidelines, outlines the nonclinical, clinical and CMC requirements for biosimilar applications and describes the review process, naming conventions and application fees. 
 Japan does not grant exclusivity to pharmaceutical products; however, the country does have a Post Marketing Surveillance, or PMS, system that affects the timing of generic entry and, in effect, provides a period of market exclusivity to innovator products. This system allows safety data to be acquired for each product. A PMS period is set for most of new drug approvals, and until this period is over, generic companies cannot submit their applications for drug approvals as generic drugs. Recently, this period was extended to 8 years for all new drug approvals. Japan’s regulations do not allow currently for interchangeability of biosimilars with their reference products.
 Expedited Review and Approval
 The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs and biologics, and/or provide for the approval of a drug or biologic on the basis of a surrogate endpoint. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be shortened. Generally, drugs that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and fill unmet medical needs. Breakthrough therapy designation is for products that are intended, alone or in combination with one or more other therapies, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the therapy may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For therapies that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. Therapies designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA may also be eligible for priority review and accelerated approval. Priority review is designed to give drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of ten months. Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. Accelerated approval provides for an earlier approval for a new drug that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and that fills an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. A surrogate endpoint is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug candidate receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials to confirm the clinically meaningful outcome as predicted by the surrogate marker trial.
 32


Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use
 Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, certain drugs may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity, if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA, or a Written Request, relating to the use of the active moiety of the drug in children. The FDA may decline to issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications or where it determines that information relating to the use of a drug in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population.
 We have not received a Written Request for such pediatric studies, although we may ask the FDA to issue a Written Request for such studies in the future. To receive the six-month pediatric market exclusivity, we would have to receive a Written Request from the FDA, conduct the requested studies in accordance with a written agreement with the FDA or, if there is no written agreement, in accordance with commonly accepted scientific principles, and submit reports of the studies. A Written Request may include studies for indications that are not currently in the labeling if the FDA determines that such information will benefit the public health. The FDA will accept the reports upon its determination that the studies were conducted in accordance with and are responsive to the original Written Request or commonly accepted scientific principles, as appropriate, and that the reports comply with the FDA’s filing requirements.
 In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most drugs and biologicals, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs, BLAs and supplements thereto must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must include the evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In both domestic and foreign markets, sales and reimbursement of any approved products will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels, for such products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Additionally, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, the payors may not cover our products after approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
 The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results.
 Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for our products will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidates or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts. Third-party payors are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit reimbursement for newly-approved health care products. Recent budgetary pressures in many EU countries are also causing governments to consider or implement various cost-containment measures, such as price freezes, increased price cuts and rebates. If budget pressures continue, governments may implement additional cost-containment measures. Cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for products that we may develop or sell, which would result in lower product revenues or royalties payable to us. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
 33


Healthcare Reform
 There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biological products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system of the United States. It is uncertain what legislative proposals will be adopted or what actions federal, state or private payors for medical goods and services may take in response to any healthcare reform proposals or legislation. Adoption of new legislation at the federal or state level could further limit reimbursement for pharmaceuticals, including our product candidates if approved. We cannot predict the effect medical or healthcare reforms may have on our business, and no assurance can be given that any such reforms will not have a material adverse effect. For additional details regarding health reform activity, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Commercialization of Product Candidates — “Healthcare legislative reform measures may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.”
Foreign Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we and our collaborators will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. Whether or not we or our collaborators obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we or our collaborators must obtain approval from the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the EU, before we or our collaborators may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
 Certain countries outside of the United States have a process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like an IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be approved by the competent national health authority and by independent ethics committees in each country in which a company intends to conduct clinical trials. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed in that country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCPs and other applicable regulatory requirements.
 Under EU regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology or those medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications such as the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, viral diseases and designated orphan medicines, and optional for other medicines which are highly innovative. Under the centralized procedure, a marketing application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency where it will be evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. A favorable opinion typically results in the grant by the European Commission of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states within 67 days of receipt of the opinion. The initial marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more “concerned” member states based on an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the “reference” member state. Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
 In China, the NMPA monitors and supervises the administration of pharmaceutical products, as well as medical devices and equipment.  In order to conduct clinical trials in China a clinical trial application must be submitted and approved by the NMPA.  When clinical trials have been completed, an applicant must apply to the NMPA for approval of a new drug application. The NMPA, the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE), and the Drug Inspection Institution will then conduct reviews and on-site inspections. The NMPA determines whether to approve the application according to the comprehensive evaluation opinions produced by the reviews and on-site inspections. We or our collaborators must obtain approval of new drug applications before our product candidates can be manufactured and sold in the Chinese market.  In addition, all facilities and techniques used in the manufacture of products for clinical use or for sale in China must be operated in conformity with good manufacturing practice guidelines as established by the NMPA. Failure to comply with applicable requirements could result in the termination of manufacturing and significant fines.
 Additional Regulation
 We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential federal, state or local regulations. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological and chemical substances used in, and waste generated by our operations. Our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and viruses. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources.
