Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, all references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Annual Report”) to the terms “Company,” “company,” “Babylon,” the “Group,” “we,” “us,” “our” and similar terms refer to Babylon Holdings Limited, together with its subsidiaries. Certain member counts are rounded to the nearest thousand. 
Business Overview
History and Development of the Company 
 We are a leading digital-first, value-based care company. Our mission is to make high quality healthcare accessible and affordable for everyone on Earth. We believe we are poised to reengineer the global healthcare market to better align system-wide incentives and to shift the focus from reactive sick care to preventative healthcare, resulting in better member health, improved member experience and reduced costs. To this end, we are building an integrated digital first primary care service that can manage population health at scale. We combine artificial intelligence and broader technologies with human expertise to deliver modern healthcare. Through the devices people already own, we offer millions of people globally ongoing, always-on care.
We were founded by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Ali Parsadoust, in 2013. Babylon Holdings Limited was incorporated on April 11, 2014 and is entering its tenth year of operation. Babylon is a company limited by shares organized under the laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey. Its registered office is at 31 Esplanade, St. Helier, Jersey, JE2 3QA. The mailing address of Babylon’s headquarters and principal executive offices is 2500 Bee Cave Road, Austin, TX 78746, and Babylon’s telephone number is (512) 967-3787.
We have completed strategic investments, acquisitions, and divestitures in recent years to help improve our ability to deliver our products and services:
•Fresno Health Care. In October 2020, we acquired certain portions of the Fresno Health Care business of FirstChoice Medical Group (“FCMG”) for $25.7 million. This acquisition was intended to advance the growth of our value-based care services, by transitioning members to digital-first tools that will enable members to access our virtual care network in conjunction with the existing physical access to services.
•Meritage Medical Network. In April 2021, we acquired Meritage Medical Network (“Meritage”) for $31.0 million. This acquisition was intended to expand the growth of our value-based care services, by transitioning over 20,000 Medicare Advantage and Commercial Health Maintenance Organization (“HMO”) patients within the Meritage network to digital-first tools to enable members to access our virtual care network in conjunction with the existing physical access to services.
•Higi. On December 7, 2021, we exercised our option to acquire the remaining 74.7% equity interest in Higi SH Holdings, Inc. (“Higi”) pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated October 29, 2021 (the “Higi Acquisition Agreement”). The closing of this acquisition occurred on December 31, 2021. The exercise price of the option to acquire the remaining Higi equity stake included the payment of $4.6 million in cash and the issuance of 136,480 Class A ordinary shares at the closing, the payment of $5.4 million at the closing to satisfy the principal and interest payable by a subsidiary of Higi pursuant to a promissory note in favor of ALP Partners Limited, an entity owned by our founder and Chief Executive Officer, the future payment of up to $0.3 million and issuance of up to 19,631 additional Class A ordinary shares after the expiration of a 15-month indemnification holdback period, and the issuance of 79,200 restricted stock units for Higi continuing employees and consultants in respect of Class A ordinary shares, of which 49,502 were vested at closing. Higi provides digital healthcare services via a network of Smart Health Stations located in the United States, and makes health kiosks found in retail pharmacies and grocery stores that provide free screenings of blood pressure, weight, pulse and body mass index. 
We believe the growing global healthcare market, which has been estimated at $10 trillion and is expected to continue to grow in the coming decades, has been unable to balance the need for accessibility, quality and affordability. These challenges, facing healthcare systems in both developed and developing markets, have not been properly addressed

by the current, largely reactive care delivery model, which is often country or even region specific. While this is generally referred to as “health care,” we consider it “sick care,” as we believe the traditional fee-for-service (“FFS”) model is designed to focus on treating patients when they are sick rather than helping them stay healthy. In an effort to address resource scarcity, new healthcare technologies have begun to emerge; however, we believe that existing digital tools, including telemedicine, simply shift the site of care but do not address the fundamental issues of when and how care is provided. The frustrations and limitations of “sick care” are spurring a movement towards value-based-care (“VBC”) models, which offer a financial incentive to providers to lower the cost and improve the quality of healthcare. However, the traditional, non-digital-first, VBC model has yet to be implemented at scale, given the upfront human capital and physical infrastructure investment required with traditional care protocols.
We believe our solution reengineers the healthcare value chain by delivering a digital-first platform for value-based care at scale. Babylon 360 couples our digital platform with a VBC contract or other risk-based agreement with a health plan, healthcare provider or a government body and can provide managed care for our members across the care continuum. Under these agreements, we take financial responsibility for all or some of the surpluses or deficits in total actual costs under the agreement compared to our negotiated fixed per member per month, or capitation, allocation, cost estimate or similar compensation arrangement, and in some cases our financial responsibility for surpluses and deficits relative to the capitation allocation is deferred until an initial agreed upon period has elapsed. This approach aligns incentives to encourage better healthcare decision making while maintaining high clinical quality and highly-rated member experience. With Babylon 360, we make our digital-first holistic care solution available for a population of identified members. We seek to engage with our members to encourage sign-ups for and increase utilization of our platform, and when we achieve a suitable level of engagement, our digital-first approach enables our members to access the full spectrum of care services, from preventative care to consultation, treatment, rehabilitation and post-care, through our end-to-end digital platform. We believe that our integrated digital platform allows us to gather data and insights to continually improve our members’ experience and their care management.
We take a proactive approach to our Global Managed Care Members’ (as defined below) health by actively engaging with such members through our digital platform, clinical operations and provider networks to:
•provide actionable insights and information about their well-being so that they can set their health goals;
•help such members to monitor their health on an ongoing basis;
•intervene early to provide the right care, medication and treatment, including by connecting patients with effective medical advice, including affiliated licensed physicians;
•design a clear clinical care plan as needed for recovery and rehabilitation; and
•transition rehabilitated patients from sick care to well care.
We believe that a majority of our Global Managed Care Members’ needs can be addressed through our digital platform and, based on our experience in the U.K. with GP at Hand, approximately 1.5-in-10 members do need in-person care. When Global Managed Care Members require in-person care, we leverage our partner networks of medical professionals, existing health plan providers, and contracted physicians to provide in-person care, reducing our need to invest in resource-and capital-intensive infrastructure. In practice, this approach allows us to reduce costly Global Managed Care Member interactions with medical professionals and unnecessary acute or urgent care visits through early intervention, and proactively manage chronic conditions. Leveraging the power of our digital-first approach, Global Managed Care Members have access to our solution to help keep them healthy and avoid emergent visits to lower the overall cost of their care. In addition, we also offer access to standalone services, including (i) software licensing through our Babylon Cloud Services offering, where we provide our digital solutions to customers that may provide care through their own medical,networks and (ii) clinical services, where our affiliated providers deliver contracted medical consultations. See “— Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Software Licensing” and — Clinical Services.” 
As of December 31, 2022, our offerings, including VBC, clinical services, and software licensing, supported patients in 15 countries. We have scaled our VBC offering rapidly over the last year to become one of the largest VBC networks in the United States, with approximately 261 thousand U.S. VBC Members as of December 31, 2022, and we expect to remain focused on U.S. growth. Across all of our geographies, results have been similar: our users gave us over

95% four-and five-star ratings in fourth quarter of 2022, including 95% in the United Kingdom, 96% in the United States, and 97% in Rwanda. 
We also have received a 87% quality score from the NHS on NHS Quality Outcome Framework (“QOF”) in 2021 and 2022. QOF is the main set of quantitative measures used by NHS and the independent quality regulator for England to assess and reward high quality. We achieved 379.5 points out of 401 points, or 95%, for the clinical domain, receiving in total 555.2 points out of 635 points, or 87%.
Additionally, according to a peer reviewed study commissioned by us and published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research, we delivered up to 35% acute care cost savings for our GP at Hand members during the relevant period. The study compared spending per patient for Babylon GP at Hand to regional average spending over a period from April 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019 in North West London, where Babylon GP at Hand is based. Moreover, according to an NHS-commissioned report published by Ipsos MORI, which looked at the use of emergency room visits by patients during each of the 12-month periods before and after joining Babylon GP at Hand, we achieved 25% fewer emergency room visits among our GP at Hand members during the relevant period. While we have demonstrated cost savings and reduction of emergency visits in these sample studies, there is no guarantee we will be able to replicate this in the future.
When we enter into new VBC contracts, under our business model, we seek to shift VBC member interactions into our digital-first framework. As described further under “— Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Value-Based Care Agreements” below, this process extends over a period of months during which we incur substantial costs. Before we can interact with the VBC members, we need to ensure that sufficient capacity is established in our virtual network to support new member interactions, and must undertake initial outreach, including marketing (after any required review and approval of materials), community events, and outreach ambassadors to encourage sign-ups to the Babylon platform by our members. The ultimate goal of this initial engagement push is to schedule and complete a virtual consultation, at which point the Babylon team can continue to engage with the member regularly over time whether through interactions with our full range of digital care tools and or through additional virtual or in-person consultations with licensed medical professionals.
We believe that our member management capabilities and our members’ health outcomes will improve and our cost of care delivery expenses will decrease when our members actively engage with our digital platform. Additionally, we expect to be able to rapidly scale and responsibly care for our growing member base with minimal incremental physical infrastructure. We are driving growth by expanding our existing service with our current customers into their wider operations and markets, converting more of our customers to the holistic Babylon 360 solution, and attracting new customers to the Babylon platform.
The Market: Key Challenges and Developments
In 2019, the global healthcare market was estimated to be a $10 trillion industry, and it is expected to grow over the coming decades with the aging of the global population and the expansion of care around the world. However, we believe the global healthcare market remains beset by the following key issues that limit capacity and effectiveness of care in both developed and developing markets.
•Accessibility. Access to healthcare services is still restricted for many individuals globally. According to the WHO, more than half of the world’s population is unable to obtain access to essential health services even in countries with well-established healthcare systems. Accessibility is also an issue in developed markets — for example, many Americans have limited access to primary care, so they rely on emergency departments for acute care. Per the US Department of Health and Human Services, in 2020 there were an estimated 131 million emergency department visits in the United States, representing an overall average of 40 visits per 100 persons, and 70 visits per 100 persons in African American populations. We believe inequities in access to health services exist not just between, but also within, countries, as national averages can mask low levels of health service coverage in disadvantaged population groups.
•Affordability. Affordability of healthcare is a problem in developed and developing markets at both a system-wide and individual level. At a macro level, expenditures on healthcare in G7 countries have increased by 44% on average in the last decade, without accompanying improvement in health outcomes, according to Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) data. Individuals also struggle with high healthcare costs: according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2021, approximately 11% of Americans report problems paying medical bills. Further, unaffordable healthcare begets inaccessibility — in a 2022 Kaiser

Table of Contents



Family Foundation Study, 33% of people in the United States reported that in the last year they or a household member had not gotten a medical test or treatment recommended by their doctor due to cost, while 43% reported putting off needed healthcare due to cost.
•Quality. Consistent delivery of quality healthcare remains a challenge across geographies, and healthcare spend does not equate to improved health outcomes. According to 2022 OECD data, the United States spends significantly more on healthcare per person than any other country (and more than twice as much per person than many other countries including the United Kingdom, France, and Canada), while a 2019 study showed that the United States has lower life expectancy than the OECD country average. Further, in low-and middle-income countries, between 5.7 and 8.4 million deaths each year (representing up to 15% of overall deaths in such countries) are attributed to poor quality care. The inadequacy of traditional healthcare has not gone unnoticed by individuals. According to a 2021 Accenture report, only one out of three people said they did not have a negative experience with a medical provider, pharmacy or hospital, with people reporting a variety of negative healthcare experiences such as their visit was not efficient (22%) or the medical advice was not helpful (19%). Among those that had a negative experience, more than one-third reported switched providers or treatments or were less likely to seek medical care the next time they needed it. According to a 2020 Ipsos survey, the United States ranks the lowest for patient satisfaction among G7 countries, with only a 30% satisfaction rating among healthcare participants. Efforts to address the challenges have led to important innovations in the healthcare industry; however, we believe they continue to have inherent limitations.
•Digital Transformation of Healthcare. We believe that patients, payers and governments are aligning on the need for cost containment through the adoption of digital solutions in the healthcare sector. Demand for and adoption of telemedicine solutions has generally been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic as it has demonstrated its benefit and importance in reaching patients. According to McKinsey, COVID-19 has caused a massive acceleration in use of telehealth. Consumer adoption skyrocketed during the pandemic, and high rates continued after the height of the pandemic, with McKinsey concluding in July 2021 that telehealth utilization had stabilized at 38 times its pre-pandemic levels, making up 13% to 17% of all medical appointments. We believe this increase in usage is here to stay, due to the inherent structural benefits of virtual delivery of healthcare, including convenience and efficiency. However, we believe that in an effort to address resource scarcity, existing digital tools, including telemedicine consultations, are simply shifting the site of care, without addressing the fundamental issues of when and how care is provided.
•Emergence of New Payment Models. The challenges of accessibility, affordability and quality facing healthcare systems have not been effectively addressed by the current, largely reactive care delivery model, which we refer to as “sick care.” Healthcare providers, paid on a FFS basis, are rewarded for a higher volume of care rather than successful patient outcomes. This compensation model promotes expensive and more frequent interventions and treatments, leading to higher costs for those responsible for healthcare spend, such as governments, employers, and individuals. This has resulted in a movement towards VBC, which realigns incentives for healthcare providers, rewarding them for improving patient outcomes rather than increasing the volume of the services they provide; however, the VBC model has yet to be implemented at scale.
The Babylon Solution
We believe our solution reengineers the healthcare value chain to simultaneously balance accessibility, affordability and quality by implementing the key attributes of digital health and value-based care.
•Accessibility. Our digital-first clinical platform makes information available to members so that they can monitor their health information on mobile devices, delivering digital-first care in countries as varied as the United States and Rwanda. We provide 24/7 digital-first access to medical professionals in the U.S. and the U.K., reducing barriers to care and improving timeliness of medical interventions. 
•Affordability. Our technology platform improves productivity and reduces administrative burdens on medical professionals through the reallocation of tasks from clinicians to lower cost personnel, and the automation of a significant portion of back-office tasks, including post-appointment tasks, proactive care outreach activities (for GP at Hand), and onboarding and off-boarding tasks. Simultaneously, our holistic care provision model allows us to actively monitor the health of our members and to provide them with targeted preventative and primary care when needed, reducing the need for expensive secondary and tertiary care. We believe that the combination of our technology platform and care provision model can dramatically reduce systemic costs. For example, in the United

Kingdom in our partnership with the NHS, a peer reviewed study commissioned by us and published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research demonstrated that we delivered up to 35% acute care cost savings for our GP at Hand members during the relevant period from April 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019. In 2021, looking at the healthcare market generally, the healthcare expenditure per capita was $4,429 in the United Kingdom and $12,530 in the United States.
•Quality. Our platform delivers standardized treatment protocols, administrative practices, technology, and automation, such as care for acute and chronic conditions, including chronic pain, pregnancy, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and numerous other health concerns in a longitudinal manner. This allows us and our affiliated healthcare providers to work from a standardized model of medical intervention, reduce variations in care, and deliver the same quality standards to all members. We believe this allows us to provide a better member experience and a higher standard of care. The quality delivered by our system has been confirmed by our members and customers; for example, in the United Kingdom, we received a 87% quality score from the NHS for 2021 to 2022. 
Babylon 360, our flagship holistic solution, combines our cutting-edge technologies with human clinical expertise and can provide managed care for our members across the care continuum. Our end-to-end care solution is facilitated through our Digital Health Suite, virtual care, in-person medical care, and post-care offerings. We believe that our platform empowers users, providers, payers and health systems to generate better health outcomes by addressing the entire care continuum model to better understand and serve their healthcare needs. By providing more care to members when they are healthy and creating clear and accessible solutions when they are sick, we believe we can avoid the significant expenses associated with late or avoidable hospital-based care. We believe our platform disrupts the current state of care delivery and aligns the interests of our members and customers and simultaneously lowers costs.
When delivering Babylon 360, we and our affiliated providers are able to provide or assist in connecting a member with end-to-end care through the creation of a comprehensive, digital-first “Pyramid of Care” tailored to the member’s specific needs and circumstances.

We aim to move as much care as possible to the less resource intensive care settings. Our Pyramid of Care consists of the following layers:
•Digital Engagement & Self-Care: Members can address the majority of their care needs in this layer - check their symptoms, track their health, manage prescriptions, access clinically-relevant insights and guidance, and more.

•Non-clinical Care Assistance & Navigation: When a member’s needs are larger than what can be delivered via self-care, they move into the Personal Care Assistance layer. All members have 24/7 access to our health assistants via chat, video, and phone for support and care navigation. This team evaluates members’ data across multiple inputs to identify important events and potential health anomalies requiring proactive outreach. 
•Virtual Clinical Consultations: We offer virtual consultations when our members need clinical care. This spans primary care and specialist doctors, nurses, behavioral health therapists, physiotherapists, dietitians, pharmacists, social workers, and more. Virtualizing as much of the physical care needs as possible is critical in distributing demand effectively to help improve accessibility and affordability of healthcare. 
•Local In-Person Care: When our members require in-person care, it is provided through a combination of partner labs, pharmacies, in-home providers, and clinics. Our digital tools follow our patients from virtual to physical networks to maintain continuity of care and a comprehensive care record for the member.
•Complex Care: When our members require complex care, Babylon refers members to the right place within our network of facilities (e.g. hospitals) and ensures that they are supported pre-admission, during their treatment, and throughout their recovery until they can engage with the Pyramid of Care again at the lowest-resource possible level. 
This pyramid is built on a mobile-native, digital self-care foundation that leverages a comprehensive, longitudinal view of a member’s specific circumstances to provide a range of AI-driven tools to help members create a set of health goals and to track their progress and achievement. This is complemented by our personal health assistant, which is available to help members with their care needs and for non-clinical support via chat or direct human interaction. When direct care is needed, it is first provided through virtual clinical consultations, accessible in the U.S. and the U.K. on a 24/7 basis, linking members with a clinical professional to address their urgent or chronic needs. While most member needs can be addressed with our digital platform and virtual care capabilities, when a member does require in-person care, we assist in connecting them with the appropriate caregiver for an in-person consultation. If a member’s care needs are more specialized or complex, we offer connections to secondary and tertiary care partners who work with us to provide the full spectrum of sick care. As members increase their digital engagement, they should be increasingly able to undertake self-care and self-monitoring and reduce the need for in-person care.
We believe our holistic care model, Babylon 360, is presented to the member in an intuitive and consumer-friendly way. When we deliver holistic care we aim to engage actively and frequently with members and provide the care they need at the point they need it, leveraging existing digital devices as the first point of call and utilizing in-person providers where needed.
•When in good health, the tools provided through our Digital Health Suite can provide members with insights and information about their well-being. 
•If members get sick, the Digital Health Suite offers 24/7 access to Digital Triage tools including a Symptom Checker as well as access to clinical care, so members get the right information and care. Through our Symptom Checker, members answer questions about their symptoms and are directed to possibly matching conditions responsive to the information entered and potential next steps. A care team gives members a clear clinical care plan for treatment and recovery. Then, once the members are back on their feet, the care team goes back to helping members to monitor their health information.
•Follow-up care is delivered by affiliated providers, including medication management, transitions to the appropriate type of care, and rehabilitation. We provide recommendations for follow-up self-care to improve overall member outcomes and ensure that members maintain their health.
Our Product
Babylon can effectively engage, assess, plan, monitor, treat and support our members in the regions in which we operate around the world with our AI-supported platform, delivering meaningful benefits to our stakeholders. Our offerings combine our cutting-edge technologies with human clinical expertise and can provide managed care for our members across the care continuum. At the core of our platform strategy is our investment into our Health Graph platform. The Health Graph is our ability to ingest large volumes of data in both real-time and batch — unstructured and structured — from hundreds of providers, wearables, and health record systems. The platform creates a data access strategy that powers our integrated AI capabilities, while simultaneously enabling real time member and clinical product experiences coupled with advanced analytics use cases.

Sitting on top of the Health Graph platform is our Health IQ service. Health IQ is a growing library of predictions that allows for real-time segmentation and health record enrichment of our members. These predictions provide our care teams with a scalable and effective way to service our members that may be at a higher risk. Our goal with our technology investments is to activate more members, monitor them through their health care journey, and intervene swiftly and early to deliver care in a more cost efficient way. This reflects our core mission as a company.
Our members’ journey starts with understanding a total picture of their health needs, to decide with whom we want to prioritize engagement. We use multiple channels to reach out to our members, from emails to phone calls to in-person visits with community health workers, to encourage members to install the Babylon app on their smartphone (or USSD app on their feature phone for regions where smartphone penetration is weak) or to sign up via the web. Once members have installed the Babylon app, they may be (subject to compliance with applicable rules) engaged on an ongoing basis through multiple push-type notifications, emails and SMS messages which may prompt them to complete a health assessment and create a personalized care treatment plan unique to their needs. The in-app health assessment, coupled with existing patient electronic health record data, patient provided data, wearable data and clinical data, allows for a convenient way to have a holistic profile of our members and to measure aspects of risk to our members.

In the U.S. or the U.K., if a member would like to see a clinician, our app can facilitate a prompt booking for a primary care, behavioral health or specialist’s appointment, on a 24/7/365 basis. For clinicians, our platform enables more efficient workflows, thus saving valuable time and allowing clinicians to focus on what’s really important — the members. Our custom-built, web-based Clinician Portal provides longitudinal data around members and allows clinicians to save time on arranging lab tests, issuing prescriptions, scheduling follow-up consultations and other frequent tasks through workflow automation. The workflow task-list helps the back office team manage the transitions of care between providers. Steps are automated using robotic process automation and our proprietary workflows platform deeply integrated into all facets of our back office platform to most efficiently use clinicians’ time and to reduce operational costs. For example, within our GP at Hand service, we use automation to assist a variety of our pre- and post-consultation care workflows. Our RPA solution fetches and prioritizes the eligible patients for proactive outreach, and then triggers the workflow platform which automatically manages and sends a set of communications, reminders and invites to the patient, reducing back office administrative tasks and involving our clinicians only at the end of the workflow when providing care to the patient.
Future Product Development
We believe that continuous data assessment, risk calculation, and early intervention are key to crafting patient care plans and driving down costs of care. We have under development proprietary AI which enables ongoing monitoring of member data which automatically suggests to clinicians and members relevant goals and actions, while keeping the clinician in the loop to lead to better health outcomes. Once developed, our system detects abnormalities during the course of this continuous data assessment, and our team would be proactively alerted to intervene to evaluate and understand the root cause and respond via email, chat, phone, or notifications.
In addition, we are deeply focused on automatically coding our patients’ conditions to get the most accurate record of their care and conditions. We expect this to provide improved accountability and transparency with the goal of reducing costly errors and augmenting our data set to enable future AI solutions. Furthermore, we are very focused on coaching and enabling habit changes that lead to better health outcomes.
The features described in this section are under active development and have not been commercialized as of the date of this Annual Report. We cannot assure if or when the features will be available for use.
Our Strengths and Key Differentiators
Our goal is to provide a full spectrum of care services through a comprehensive digital-first platform powered by an AI-supported, cloud-based, integrated technology stack. Our key strengths and differentiators are:
•Purpose-Built, Tech-Enabled & AI-Supported. Our end-to-end healthcare platform is supported by AI, which we believe optimizes efficiency and improves outcomes across the entire care management value chain, from risk stratification to triage to care management. This digital-first, technology-forward approach has been our strategy from the outset and is intrinsically built into our care delivery solutions, in contrast to other care providers that have bolted technology capabilities onto a traditional care delivery model. We have heavily invested in our technology as well as in our team of highly experienced researchers, scientists and engineers since our founding in 2013, which we believe gives us a significant advantage over other care providers and will continue to progress

our capabilities. We are also able to license our technology to third parties. Our AI and automation reduce the human capital intensity of providing healthcare, while seeking to improve the quality of decision making and health outcomes, offering:
•Evidence-based insights, whole person care, and lifestyle and behavioral risk benchmarking for over 22 common diseases;
•A cloud-based, integrated self-care and clinical services platform, which allows us to deliver convenient, continuous and scalable care globally; and
•Integrated technology and virtual clinical operations, which automate low value tasks, allowing the focus to be on high value interactions and drive more efficiency than a normal physical primary care operation.
•Proven & Highly-Scalable Care Delivery Model. Our digital-first model is highly scalable, which differentiates us from competitors. We believe traditional integrated care competitors who rely on a capital-intensive bricks-and-mortar-first model may have a reduced ability to expand to new markets and capture segment share beyond their near-term physical footprint. We are able to deliver fully-integrated, personalized healthcare and access across the entire care spectrum through mobile devices many individuals already own or access. This technology allows us to offer access to on-demand care, on a 24/7 basis, through our digital platform while leveraging existing, local healthcare infrastructure in markets where our affiliated providers deliver care. This is evidenced by the rapid go-to-market in Missouri through our partnership with Home State Health, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Centene Corporation, where, within three months of reaching substantially final agreed terms, we made our Babylon 360 solution accessible to approximately 17,000 members with limited incremental investment so that both Centene’s existing local healthcare network and our technology platform were at their disposal. Additionally, because a population of members is assigned to us under our VBC contracts, we are able to focus our outreach efforts on engagement with our assigned members.
• Proactively Delivering Mobile-Native Care to Members. Our digital-first platform allows us to deliver access to integrated, personalized healthcare at scale through our app on the devices most individuals already own. This enables us to quickly, efficiently and effectively interact with members to provide support and care, ideally preventing a member from becoming sick. Upon commencing service under a new Babylon 360 contract, we quickly seek to make direct contact with each member covered under that contract to offer a digital assessment. If required, we also offer to connect members to an introductory video consultation with a clinician. Following member onboarding, we continue to provide proactive monitoring and communicate electronically through email and the Babylon app to drive member engagement. Our care teams proactively offer personalized healthcare plans for high risk members involving higher levels of interaction with their care team. Medium risk members also get personalized care plans with a lower number of interactions with the.care team and a focus on healthy living coaching and education. Low-risk members are provided with resources for self-help and education about general wellness.
•Deep Experience in Value-Based and Other Managed Care. We aim to improve the member experience and reduce the cost of care by prioritizing member centric care and incentivizing healthcare providers to keep their members healthy, which can lower healthcare costs over the member’s lifetime. From our earliest work with customer groups including the NHS, which provides primary care at a fraction of the cost of what is typical in the United States, we have developed deep experience in the delivery of care within capitated systems. Through the creation of a proactive, digital-first care network, which can provide our members with a well-structured “Care Pyramid,” we shift member interactions to virtual care and provide timely and targeted in-person care when needed. The goal of our Babylon 360 solution is to manage the totality of a member’s healthcare. Babylon 360 couples our digital platform with a VBC contract or other risk-based agreement with a health plan, healthcare provider or a government body. Under these agreements, we take financial responsibility for all or some of the surpluses or deficits in total actual costs under the agreement compared to our negotiated fixed per member per month, or capitation allocation, cost estimate or similar compensation arrangement, and in some cases our financial responsibility for surpluses and deficits relative to the capitation allocation is deferred until an initial agreed upon period has elapsed. By significantly improving accessibility and availability of primary and urgent care, we believe it is possible to create significant downstream savings. For example, in the United Kingdom in our partnership with the NHS, a peer reviewed study commissioned by us and published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research demonstrated that we delivered up to 35% acute care cost savings for our GP at Hand members during the relevant period from April 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019.
Our Growth Strategy
12 


Table of Contents



We are pursuing the following strategies in order to expand access to high-quality, affordable healthcare:
•Expand covered population and scope of services in existing markets. We have a significant opportunity to cover additional members in the markets we currently serve by both (i) signing more profitable contracts with new payers and enterprise customers and (ii) expanding the scope of services provided to our existing customer base. If we expand the scope of services we provide, for example, by upselling a clinical services contract to a VBC contract, we have the ability to significantly increase our revenue per member. We continue to demonstrate that our offerings are attractive and cost-saving for payers. In our partnership with the NHS, we have saved up to 35% of acute care hospital costs, while delivering high-quality healthcare to our GP at Hand members. For a description of the study done on our solution, see “— Business Overview” We believe that these demonstrated savings will both attract new customers and convince existing licensing and FFS customers to upgrade to our VBC offering, Babylon 360, and we have already been successful in doing so — since the start of our expansion into the U.S. market, several customers have upgraded their contracts from initially planned clinical services provision to Babylon 360 contracts.
•Expand to new markets with new and existing customers. Due to the scalability of our digital-first platform we are able to efficiently expand into new geographical markets, both within and outside the United States. We believe that our existing customer relationships present a particularly attractive growth opportunity. Currently, our focus is on disciplined expansion within the U.S. market. In 2023, we are accelerating our growth in the U.S. by continuing to sell our Babylon Cloud Services and our Babylon 360 offerings. We are acquiring multiple new customers, diversifying our customer base, and targeting an increase in Medicare Advantage and commercial populations. We are also addressing new segments such as self-insured employers by establishing our own enterprise sales force. While we focus today on the U.S. and U.K., we have deployed our technology in 15 countries and actively provide clinical services in three. We continue to capitalize on the deployable nature of our model and technology to pursue business opportunities, both in licensing and clinical care, in new markets with attractive economic opportunities.
•Continuing to invest our technology to improve our care capabilities. We have invested heavily in our technology platform since our founding and believe that it is both world-leading and vital to our continued success in the provision of digital-first care solutions. With this view, we continue to invest in our technology platform and seek to enhance our leadership position in clinically focused healthcare AI and other applications that can improve our members’ health and experience.
Our Technology
To date, we have heavily invested in a proprietary healthcare delivery platform that we believe is member friendly, reduces the administrative burden for our clinicians, and enables us to scale across geographies. Our solutions are powered by a cloud-enabled platform that is built to maximize interoperability, be accessible to individuals through all kinds of mobile devices, and leverage custom workflow platforms to optimize efficiency in clinicians’ back offices. We believe the key features of our technology platform are the following:
•Proprietary. Over the last decade, we have designed a proprietary platform on which we can drive the creation of cohesive, custom solutions supported by AI. In contrast, our competitors rely on many third-party solutions that are decoupled and disjointed, reducing the ability to leverage AI and data to drive overall efficiency and value for their members and providers. Our software is built in line with strong security and privacy controls, and our processes are externally audited for compliance with required standards. We use highly agile software development methodologies to promote effective, metric-driven development while complying with our secure development lifecycle.
•Cloud Architecture. Our globally accessible services are cloud enabled by design for maximum efficiency and scale. Our approach to delivery allows us to operate in multiple cloud regions around the world with a federated approach that enables unique data residency and data sovereignty requirements per country. Built from inception to be powered from the cloud, we aim to be cloud service provider-agnostic, enabling us to deploy our solutions more broadly and globally where there may be a gap in cloud provider coverage through various strategic partnerships.

•Integration. Using a standards-based, interoperable interface allows us to integrate seamlessly and efficiently with third party electronic medical records systems and other healthcare data providers. Leveraging a standards-based HL7-FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) approach, we are able to ingest, process and store data from a wide variety of sources, creating a unified view of our members (while ensuring this is in compliance with privacy laws).
•Widely Accessible. We deliver our digital solutions to our members and providers via cutting-edge front-end technology through both web and smartphone applications. At the same time, we serve individuals with basic flip phones through a proprietary application in developing countries such as Rwanda, facilitating our mission of delivering affordable and accessible healthcare to all.
•Optimizes Back Office Efficiency. Leveraging open source and third-party technology, we have built a highly configurable platform that automates non-clinical tasks such as processing referrals and prescription management, reducing providers’ administrative burden and increasing their operational efficiency. This platform approach allows us to leverage our data and AI strategy to deliver these “back office” workflow services, driving additional value for our members by mitigating friction and delays, which individuals typically face in traditional healthcare delivery models.
How We Leverage Artificial Intelligence
Underpinning our healthcare delivery platform is our bespoke AI solution that has been designed to help our members navigate their personal healthcare journeys and is currently deployed in our Symptom Checker and Healthcheck products, as well as our clinical portals to assist clinicians with some administrative functions. We believe that our member-centric approach, which considers our members’ healthcare and sick-care, differentiates us from our competitors, whose solutions adopt a narrow, often impersonal approach that fails to consider the full spectrum of healthcare. Leveraging our team’s deep experience in building intelligent healthcare systems, our AI architecture has been designed from the ground up over the last decade to deliver actionable insights and recommendations.
A core feature of this architecture is the inclusion, by design, of core principles such as interpretability and explain ability. These features are critical when delivering insights through member-facing products since they provide transparency to our clinicians (via our “clinician-in-the-loop” platform) for them to understand the provenance of the data and parameters in our AI and to have the ability to independently assess the basis of our AI’s conclusions. These principles, which are inherent features of causal approaches to AI, help overcome the “black-box” problem — the notion that an AI system can deliver insights, but is incapable of explaining how it has arrived at its conclusions. This capability provides our customers and clinicians with a critical layer of transparency on the insights provided to our members via products such as the Symptom Checker and Health Assessment.
Another key feature of our AI technology is its ability to quantify the uncertainty of its predictions. In contrast to the majority of “black-box” AI systems which tend towards making overly-confident predictions, uncertainty-aware AI systems are better equipped to quantify and assess how much additional information is required to make predictions with a specified level of confidence.
Additionally, our AI has been designed to be data-efficient and flexible with respect to the information it consumes, enabling us to rapidly adapt our models to new populations. Our AI systems leverage health records from multiple sources where available and in compliance with applicable privacy rules, but also permit other sources of evidence such as data, for example, clinician input and published studies, and medical knowledge, including from clinical guidelines and pathways, to be incorporated where data quality or abundance is a concern. For example, our systems benefit from feedback from our teams of local clinicians who review our AI systems’ use of data in light of local beliefs, language and healthcare concerns. This approach has allowed us to adapt and rapidly localize our AI models to account for differences in language, culture and disease burden across geographies, enabling us to serve populations globally.
Our Go-to-Market Model
Working with governments, payers and providers to deliver quality healthcare services globally, we monetize our platform in three primary ways — value-based care, clinical services, and software licensing.
Value-Based Care Agreements
14 


Table of Contents



Under VBC contracts, we manage the healthcare needs of our members in a centralized manner, where we negotiate a fixed per member per month (“PMPM”) or capitation allocation, often based on a percentage of the payer’s premium or MLR with the payer. We assume financial responsibility for member healthcare services, which means that, throughout the measurement period, the total actual medical costs are compared to the capitation allocation. At the end of the measurement period, Babylon will receive all or part of any savings, as compared to the capitation allocation, or be responsible for all or part of excess costs above the capitation allocation. We take financial responsibility for costs incurred for physician-based care, referred to as professional risk, and secondary and tertiary facility care, referred to as institutional risk (and together with professional risk, referred to as global risk).
Through member engagement with our services, and while maintaining high clinical quality and excellent member experience, we seek to improve member healthcare while keeping the costs incurred for member healthcare below the capitation amount. Our cost savings are typically driven by improved management of chronic conditions and proactive, preventative care to keep members healthier thereby avoiding unnecessary emergency room visits and hospitalizations. Patients, payers and providers are encouraged to adopt our care pathways. We have acquired independent physician associations comprised of medical group members that have already entered into VBC contracts that utilize their physical networks, and we are transitioning the VBC members to our digital-first framework. As we shift VBC member interactions into our digital-first framework, we believe that our member management capabilities and our members’ health outcomes will improve and our cost of care delivery will decrease. 
Each VBC contract is different in terms of structure and pricing due to state regulations, national health systems and payer negotiations. Before entering into a new contract, we analyze internal and external data on a given patient population, including, but not limited to, historical claims, population demographics, utilization and other key performance data. We perform an actuarial analysis and combine this information with inflation and local market adjustments. Because our business is to manage healthcare rather than act as a reinsurer, we also have “stop loss” insurance on all of our VBC contracts that generally is invoked when expenditures on any individual patient exceeds a predefined threshold in any given year. The amounts paid under VBC contracts per at-risk patient can be significantly higher than the fees for services provided under FFS arrangements. Consequently, when costs for providing service are effectively managed, the revenue and profit generation opportunities under VBC contracts are significantly more attractive than under FFS arrangements. 
When we enter a contract with a new cohort, there are several substantial pillars to stand up before we can optimize our engagement with members. Commensurate with the number of new members in a specific cohort, we need to ensure that sufficient capacity is established in the virtual network to support new member interactions. There is also a staffing component to this initial infrastructure build-out, where medical professionals, support staff, and local outreach ambassadors need to be vetted, hired, and trained to the elevated standards we hold ourselves to. This process, necessary in any new state we enter, and required to be in place before we can interact with a single member, can take up to several months.
Once this infrastructure is established, we aim to encourage new members to sign-up for the platform, and, if they sign up, we can increase and optimize our engagement with them. The process begins with initial outreach, including marketing (after any required review and approval of materials), community events, and outreach ambassadors, all designed to drive sign-ups to and engagement with our digital platform, which can take up to three months. Following these initial stages, member sign-ups to our platform take place gradually over time. The ultimate goal of this initial engagement push is to schedule and complete a virtual consultation, at which point our team can continue to engage with the member regularly over time and establish ongoing care and high value interactions with our full range of digital care tools or through additional virtual or in-person consultations with licensed medical professionals.
When we convert someone to being a repeat user of our service, it has a meaningful impact on how that person chooses to navigate the healthcare system. For repeat users of our service, evidence indicates that Babylon is quickly becoming their gateway into the healthcare system, which enables us to improve their experience and better control cost of care. In Missouri, for example, we have seen encouraging results where more than half of patients that have completed their first appointment go on to have future appointments.
Understanding this process, and the time and costs associated with setting up new cohorts, is crucial to contextualize our cost of care and margins as we enter new states and sign on new cohorts. 44% of our U.S. VBC Members on December 31, 2022 (as defined in “— Classification of Our Members — U.S. VBC Members” below) were new in 2022, with an additional 34,000 members added in the first quarter of 2023, and with our value-based care agreements in Missouri and California having the longest tenure at less than three years.

Clinical Services
We provide access to our digital platform to customers including health plans, enterprises that offer our platform to their employees, and directly to private users. Our clinical services offering is tailored to our customers’ needs, but can include access to our full range of digital care tools, including our app-based Digital Health Suite (which may be accessed as a per member per month fee and classified as licensing fee revenue), as well as access to consultations with licensed medical professionals. Our revenue model for clinical services is based on a combination of FFS and capitated fees under a risk-based agreement. Under our FFS arrangements, payers pay a specified amount for each virtual consultation or patient visit. As a result, FFS-based revenue is demand-driven and dependent on volume of virtual consultations or, in some cases, patient visits completed.
Software Licensing
Through our Babylon Cloud Services offering, we can license our digital platform to a broad spectrum of customers, including healthcare providers, payers, self-insured employers, retailers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and telecommunications companies. Through our licensing activity, we can offer access to a range of digital platform options such as (i) the Symptom Checker and Health Graph tools, for use cases in which care can be de-escalated or referred, as necessary, to in person services; (ii) the entire Digital Health Suite of tools, which focuses on digitizing the front door of providers and payers; and (iii) delivering a bundle which incorporates a combination of the Digital Health Suite with chronic condition management and virtual care services to targeted populations. We believe that software licensing represents an effective way of leveraging our technology platform into customer segments or geographies where we do not currently have commercial operations or a near-term plan to market clinical services or VBC contracts. 
Classification of Our Members
Members
We define “Members” as individuals, globally, who are covered by one of our value-based care agreements described under “— Our Go-to-Market Model — Value-Based Care Agreements” above or other risk-based agreements with a health plan, healthcare provider or a government body (including NHS bodies in England), or who have access to our digital platform through our software license agreements described under “— Our Go-to-Market Model — Software Licensing” or one of our clinical services offerings described under “— Our Go-to-Market Model — Clinical Services” above. In some instances, “member” is used only to refer to those registered to use the Babylon app, and in others, it refers to those that are eligible under contract to use the Babylon app, whether or not they have registered to use the Babylon app. 
U.S. VBC Members 
We define “U.S. VBC Members” as individuals who are covered by one of our VBC contracts with a U.S. health plan or healthcare provider. Under these agreements, we take financial responsibility for all or some of the surpluses or deficits in total actual costs under the agreement compared to our negotiated fixed per member per month, or capitation, allocation. In some of our VBC contracts, our financial responsibility for these surpluses or deficits is deferred until an initial agreed upon period has elapsed.
Global Managed Care Members
We define “Global Managed Care Members” as individuals globally who are covered by one of our value-based care agreements or other risk-based agreements with a health plan, healthcare provider or a government body (including NHS bodies in England), under which we assume partial or full risk for the specified costs of members’ healthcare (which may be all-inclusive healthcare costs or more limited professional costs). Under these agreements, we take financial responsibility for all or some of the surpluses or deficits in total actual costs under the agreement compared to our negotiated PMPM or capitation allocation, cost estimate or similar compensation arrangement. Our U.S. VBC Members and Babylon GP at Hand members are both Global Managed Care Members.
Our Global Reach
As of December 31, 2022, our VBC, clinical services and/or software licensing offerings supported patients in 15 countries, as further described below. Since January 2020, we have grown to provide access to our VBC and clinical services offerings in eight states as of December 31, 2022, of which approximately 261 thousand were U.S. VBC 
16 


Table of Contents



Members. We added approximately 34,000 U.S. VBC Members in the first quarter of 2023, introducing four more states receiving access to our VBC and clinical services offerings.
We offer our members access to affiliated healthcare providers licensed in all 50 states, on a 24/7 basis.
Value-Based Care, Including Babylon 360
The expansion of our VBC offerings in the United States, including our digital-first Babylon 360 solution, is our primary focus for growth on a go-forward basis. We are driving such growth by expanding our existing service with our current health care plan customers into their wider operations and markets, converting more of our U.S. customers to the holistic Babylon 360 solution, and attracting new customers to the Babylon platform.
We offer our Babylon 360 solution to approximately 15,000 Home State Health Medicaid members through a VBC contract. This arrangement is a primary example of our core strategy in the United States — providing digital-first, value-based care at a pre-agreed capitation rate. 
We entered into an agreement to support Medicaid members in Georgia and Mississippi, covering approximately 80,000 members as of December 31, 2022. In January 2022, we entered into an additional agreement in Iowa to cover approximately 71,000 members as of December 31, 2022. 
We are also focused on moving beyond Medicaid into other payor segments, particularly Commercial deals. In January 2023, Babylon launched a new digital-first Commercial Exchange product with Ambetter, covering approximately 34,000 commercial members across six states. This digital-first deal is our first under the “Gatekeeper” benefit design model, which allows us to act as the gatekeeper for the members’ health services, which we expect to substantially increase our ability to ramp up engagement and impact members’ behavior. We are currently prioritizing other deals with this benefit design model in our commercial pipeline.
We are also participating in the Accountable Care Organization (“ACO”) Realizing Equity, Access, and Community Health (REACH) (“ACO REACH”) Model with CMS by working with an ACO. The financial aspects of the ACO REACH Model are set forth in an agreement between the ACO and CMS which commenced on January 1, 2023. Under our managed care services agreement with the ACO, we provide care management services and our digital-first services to 18,000 Medicare beneficiaries in California in a value-based care arrangement. CMS reserves the right to amend its agreement with the ACO without the consent of the ACO for good cause or as necessary to comply with applicable federal or state law, regulatory requirements, accreditation standards or licensing guidelines or rules. We had previously participated in the Direct Contracting Model with CMS by working with a Direct Contracting Entity. CMS transitioned the Direct Contracting Model into the ACO REACH Model in January 2023.
In addition, we have acquired a number of national payer-sponsored VBC contracts via prior acquisitions. Through our California based independent physician associations, or IPA — Meritage Medical Network — that was acquired by an affiliated professional entity, we offer access to VBC services on a capitation basis for approximately 67,000 U.S. VBC Members, including carrying global risk for Medicare Advantage members, and professional risk for Medi-Cal and commercial VBC members.
Clinical Services
We began delivering on demand urgent care, primary care, and integrated behavioral health services through Babylon’s digital platform in the United States in January 2020, on a licensing and FFS basis to health plans. This business model is consistent with that of our agreement with Bupa in the United Kingdom, as described below. This model has been, and we believe will continue to be, a valuable entry point into delivering our holistic Babylon 360 solution to a broader population base.
Higi
On May 15, 2020, we acquired 10.2% of the fully diluted capital stock of Higi. Through a series of investments, we then increased our shareholdings in Higi to 25.3% on a fully diluted basis. On December 7, 2021, we exercised our option to acquire the remaining equity interest in Higi pursuant to the Higi Acquisition Agreement. The closing of this acquisition occurred on December 31, 2021.

Table of Contents



Higi provides digital healthcare services via a network of Smart Health Stations located in the United States, and makes health kiosks found in retail pharmacies and groceries that provide free screenings of blood pressure, weight, pulse and body mass index. Higi has manufactured various models of the Higi station after obtaining marketing authorization from the FDA. It is not a diagnostic device and only furnishes data so that users can consult their personal physician or other healthcare professional. The user can also choose to store or send the data to a personal physician or healthcare professional. The Higi station has received 510(k) clearance from the FDA.
DayToDay
In October 2019, we purchased a majority stake in DayToDay. On November 16, 2021, we acquired the remaining equity stake in DayToDay. DayToDay provides patients targeted education, communication and clinical support from a personal care team before or after clinical visits, hospitalizations, or surgeries through its mobile application and platform. The DayToDay acquisition bolstered our product offering by providing patient management for acute care episodes.
United Kingdom
In the United Kingdom, we deliver our Babylon GP at Hand in England offering, providing primary medical services under a contract with the NHS, and provide clinical services through our agreement with Bupa, a private insurer, as well as through agreements with employers for whom we provide employees access to our clinical services. We provide these services through a mix of FFS and capitation fees.
During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, 3.7%, 11.1%, and 36.4%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from our business in the United Kingdom. 
Babylon GP at Hand
Babylon GP at Hand is part of our clinical services offering. Through this service, we offer primary medical services for patients registered with Babylon GP at Hand or temporarily resident in the area and seeking primary medical care. Our reimbursement model is the same as other GPs in England that hold general medical services contracts and is based on the Carr-Hill formula — a capitation model primarily based on age and gender of the patient. Since it started in 2017, we grew our Babylon GP at Hand offering over fifty times, from 2,000 to over 100,000 members, and from one location to five physical locations. Today, anyone who lives or works within 30 minutes of one of our physical premises, irrespective of age and health, can register with Babylon GP at Hand. We have further improved accessibility of healthcare for our Babylon GP at Hand patients by providing digital consultation within two hours of a registered patient seeking an appointment compared to over a week, the average for an NHS GP appointment. At the same time, Babylon GP at Hand has received an overall “Good” rating from the CQC, the independent regulator of health and social care in England. CQC is responsible for inspecting health and social care providers in England and, based on its inspection, assigns one of four ratings, which are “Inadequate,” “Requires improvement,” “Good” and “Outstanding,” to five domains, including “Safe,” “Well-led,” “Responsive,” “Effective” and “Caring,” and an overall assessment covering all five domains. CQC also assigned an overall “Good” rating to Babylon Healthcare Services Limited, which is sub-contracted to deliver services to Babylon GP at Hand.
Additionally, CQC assigned Babylon Healthcare Services Limited an “Outstanding” rating in the “Well-led” domain, and Babylon GP at Hand has 95% four and five-star ratings from its members.
We employ doctors, nurses, prescribing pharmacists and other specialists in order to deliver this care to our membership. Our work with the NHS has demonstrated conclusive cost savings. The NHS’s own studies have shown that our GP at Hand member base has experienced reduced acute care costs by over 35% compared to a similar population.
Bupa
Bupa is the United Kingdom’s largest private health insurer, used by over two million people alongside the NHS. Bupa’s covered population has access to Babylon’s digital platform, for which we are paid a capitation fee per member. In addition, Bupa members can undertake virtual consultations with our doctors or healthcare professionals, for which we receive a FFS. Following a virtual consultation, if appropriate, we then refer these members into the secondary care system— either with the NHS or through Bupa’s private network. We do not operate any physical premises in order to deliver healthcare to these members.

Bupa is part of our clinical services offering.
Canada
In Canada, we deliver our Babylon Cloud Services offering via a software licensing agreement. We have entered into a seven-year agreement to license our white-labeled digital platform to TELUS Health, allowing TELUS to provide integrated clinical services to members through a TELUS-branded version of the Babylon digital platform.
Rest of the World
In furtherance of our global mission to provide accessible and affordable quality healthcare to everyone on Earth, we are continuing to expand our global reach, beginning in Southeast Asia and Rwanda.
Southeast Asia
In June 2018, we signed an agreement with Prudential, a leading provider of health insurance in Asia, to license our white-labeled digital platform to Prudential members through the Prudential-branded “Pulse” app. Since then, we have configured our digital platform, which is capable of operating in 12 languages in the region, to offer services across 11 countries in Southeast Asia, using 14 epidemiological models.
Rwanda
In Rwanda, we deliver clinical services on a FFS basis. Since commencing operations in Rwanda in 2019, we have scaled rapidly to cover 2.8 million users in Rwanda as of December 31, 2022, providing both physical and telemedicine consultations through our network of local doctors, clinical field workers and other healthcare professionals. Initial funding for this operation was provided in conjunction with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and, following the initial period, the government of Rwanda signed a 10-year agreement with us for the provision of clinical services. While its revenue contribution is relatively small, we see Rwanda as a core part of our mission to deliver affordable and accessible healthcare to all, and in due course we expect to seek to expand our delivery further in Africa.
Sales and Marketing
We generally build our pipeline through a combination of responding to inbound inquiries, outbound sales and marketing efforts, including by email and through our website and social media, and existing customer relationships. While we do not generally participate in request-for-proposal (“RFP”) processes in our go-to-market activities due to our unique offering and competitive position, it is possible that these processes will become more prevalent in the future.
Our marketing strategy is focused on building brand awareness by highlighting our digital-first solution and demonstrating the return on investment we provide for our existing customers. Our business customers include healthcare providers, insurers, governments, and employers that sponsor employee memberships as part of their benefits packages.
Historically, we have relied on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our total revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, two, three, and four customers, respectively, represented 10% or more of our total revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, our top ten customers accounted for 91.2%, 93.1% and 90.0% of our revenue, respectively.
Affiliated Physicians and Healthcare Professionals
The corporate practice of medicine prohibition exists in some form, by statute, regulation, board of medicine or attorney general guidance, or case law, in more than 30 U.S. states, all of which we operate in, though the broad variation between state application and enforcement of the doctrine makes an exact count difficult. Due to the prevalence of the corporate practice of medicine doctrine, including in the states where we predominantly conduct our business, we provide administrative and management services to affiliated professional entities pursuant to which those entities reserve exclusive control and responsibility for all aspects of the practice of medicine and the delivery of medical services. We contract with such physician-owned entities through business support agreements for the provision of back office and administrative support services in exchange for a management fee. We have entered into option agreements or direct share transfer agreements with the owners of such affiliated entities to allow for timely succession planning. We expect that the 
19 


Table of Contents



relationships with these affiliated practices and their owner-physicians will continue although we cannot guarantee that they will. A material change in our relationship with these physician-owned entities, whether resulting from a dispute among the entities, a change in government regulation, or the loss of these affiliations, could impair our ability to provide services to our consumers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Competition
The healthcare industry and, to a lesser extent, the telemedicine and digital self-care industries in which we operate are highly competitive. We operate in multiple international markets and have demonstrated the ability to provide comprehensive, digital-first, technology-enabled care across the full healthcare value chain. We are not aware of any public company which compares precisely in terms of breadth and scope. Competitors in the market are generally focused on one specific slice of the healthcare spectrum, single chronic condition or a single mode of service (e.g., telemedicine) rather than delivering the entire healthcare needs of a member. These platforms may be technology-enabled, but typically have highly specific physical infrastructure, or are broad-based integrated care solutions that are difficult to scale.
We view as competitors those companies whose primary business is developing and marketing remote healthcare platforms and services and also those engaged in value-based care, such as Agilon health, Amwell, Oak Street Health, One Medical (which was acquired by Amazon in February 2023) and Teladoc. Competition focuses on, among other factors, technology, breadth and depth of functionality, range of associated services, operational experience, customer support, extent of customer base, and reputation. The lack of AI and broader member-centric healthcare technology in the more traditional telehealth companies significantly reduces the actionability of the data collected by the provider and increases the difficulty of robotic process automation. We believe our digital-first approach is unique, enabling our members to easily access the advice, support and treatment they need using digital and online tools, and is fully integrated with our clinical operations and provider networks to provide an end-to-end healthcare solution. Furthermore, in our view, their limited ability to expand the value capture per customer in turn limits their total addressable market and future growth and valuation prospects.
In the health system market, healthcare systems could be considered competitors, but many have chosen to partner with us to integrate our capabilities into their own offerings.
While we do not believe there are currently any direct competitors with global reach that offer the full suite of solutions as we do, and we believe we are well positioned to execute our business model and reinvent healthcare with our digital-first approach, we could face significant competition from traditional health insurance companies in the future. The incumbent healthcare system and health insurance companies are larger than us and have significant competitive advantages over us, including increased name recognition, greater resources, additional access to capital (including utilizing such capital to acquire or partner with other companies or technologies) and a broader array of healthcare offerings than we currently offer. Moreover, as we expand into new lines of business and offer additional products beyond clinical care and self-care, we could face intense competition from traditional healthcare systems and health insurance companies that are already established, some of whom also utilize AI, telehealth, ePharma, virtual care delivery and next generation payer and provider models. We compete with health insurers and large corporations that are making inroads into the digital healthcare industry and that are increasingly focused on the development of digital health technology, often through initiatives and partnerships. These technology companies, which may offer their solutions at lower prices, are continuing to develop additional products and are becoming more sophisticated and effective. 
We also compete with new market entrants as well as large communications software players who offer an entry-level priced and simplified offering for telehealth. Competition may also increase from large technology companies, such as Apple, Amazon (which acquired One Medical in February 2023), Facebook, Verizon, or Microsoft, who may wish to develop or expand their own telehealth solutions or partner with our other competitors, as well as from large retailers like Kroger, CVS Health Corporation (which signed a definitive agreement to acquire Oak Street Health in February 2023), Walgreens or Walmart. The surge in interest in telemedicine, in part due to the emergence of COVID-19, and the relaxation of HIPAA privacy and security requirements has also attracted new competition from providers who utilize consumer-grade video conferencing solutions, such as Zoom Video and Twilio.
We believe that the breadth of our existing client ecosystem, the depth of our technology platform, and our business-to-business focus on promoting existing healthcare brands and integrating freely with multiple platforms increases the likelihood that stakeholders seeking to develop telehealth solutions, both within and outside of healthcare, will choose to collaborate with us.

Intellectual Property
The protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important aspect of our business. We intend to rely upon a combination of trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality procedures, contractual commitments, patents and other legal rights to establish and protect our intellectual property. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements and invention of work product assignment agreements (or equivalent contractual arrangements) with our employees and consultants to control access to, and clarify ownership of, our proprietary information.
Our material intellectual property includes (without limitation) core items of our software, such as our Digital Health Suite mobile app and its features, including our AI-enabled products such as the Symptom Checker and Health Assessment (which are also licensed to certain customers to integrate into their own products). Our material intellectual property also includes certain AI technologies underlying the Symptom Checker and Health Assessment products. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, patents and other legal rights to protect these software products and related technologies.
The use of patent protection, with a focus on the United States, is part of our intellectual property strategy. We conduct regular strategic reviews of our pending applications and granted patents to ensure that the scope, size and maintenance costs of the portfolio remain aligned with the direction of our business. As of February 16, 2023, we own 23 granted U.S. utility patents, excluding the patents granted to Higi (as described in the next paragraph), and one granted European patent (validated in the United Kingdom), and have five U.S. utility patent applications pending. These granted patents and applications primarily relate to our AI technologies in the fields of probabilistic reasoning and decision-making and natural language processing for healthcare. Some of these technologies are used in our AI-enabled products such as the Symptom Checker, including its medical reasoning and decision-making and conversational features, to facilitate an improved understanding of our members.
In addition, as of February 16, 2023, Higi owns five granted U.S. utility patents, primarily relating to systems for measuring blood pressure, and five granted U.S. design patents relating to the designs of several components of Higi’s health assessment kiosks.
We rely on trademarks to protect the Babylon brand. As of February 9, 2023, we hold 86 foreign registered trademarks and two registered U.S. trademarks (excluding the Higi and DayToDay U.S. trademarks described below), and we have 11 trademark applications pending, three of which are U.S. trademark applications. Our registered trademark portfolio primarily seeks to protect the name BABYLON and our heart logo for relevant goods and services. In addition, as of February 16, 2023, Higi holds four registered U.S. trademarks (including in respect of the name HIGI) and DayToDay holds one registered U.S. trademark (in respect of the name DAYTODAY).
We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. Intellectual property laws, procedures, and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, or misappropriated. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology.
Commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance Leadership
Leadership in environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) issues is central to our mission of putting accessible, affordable, and quality health services in the hands of everyone on Earth. Having a positive impact on our patients, employees, customers, partners, and the environment, with leadership that is accountable to our stakeholders, is critically important to our business. 
We have examined and taken steps to address the ESG risks and opportunities of our operations, products and services. We organize our ESG initiatives into three pillars—the Environmental Pillar, Social Pillar and Governance Pillar—each of which contains focus areas for our attention and action. 
Our Environmental Pillar is focused on our commitment to being net zero no later than 2050, doing our part in reversing the deleterious impacts of climate change on the health of our planet and people. As our first step, we are measuring our global Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions to set a benchmark. We will then publish our greenhouse emissions data and interim reduction targets. We solidified our net zero commitment by becoming a member of Tech Zero,

Our business mission is intrinsically tied to our Social Pillar: making high-quality healthcare accessible and affordable for everyone.
•Addressing Healthcare Inequalities. Underpinning our mission is a commitment to addressing inequalities in healthcare faced by those with low incomes and who live in low resource settings. Whether it is partnering with the Rwandan government to help fulfill its pledge to provide universal healthcare access, or offering value-based care to Medicaid recipients, we remove barriers to healthcare by customizing our model and services to meet the unique needs of our members.
•Talent Attraction, Engagement and Retention. Our ability to attract a skilled workforce of engineers, mathematicians, scientists and healthcare practitioners, and a diverse workforce reflective of our members, is critical to meeting our mission and achieving results for our members, healthcare partners, shareholders and other stakeholders. Reward at Babylon helps us all share in our collective success and align long-term incentives through bonus and equity awards. We extend our mission to our employees, encouraging healthy lifestyles, emotional and physical well-being and a work-life balance through flexible work arrangements, healthy lifestyle perks, such as free yoga classes and healthy snacks, and health and well-being support from health advocates, mental health first aiders and well-being circles. Our Be Brilliant performance management framework supports at least annual performance reviews and career pathway mapping.
•Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. With employees hailing from countries across the world, our diversity is a cornerstone of our culture. Our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DEI”) program is incorporated across organizational departments, levels, and activities. Our Power of Diversity Resource Groups, which include Black Alliance Network, Women in Tech Health, LGBT Allies, and Interfaith, provide support to members and an avenue for groups to advise senior stakeholders on DEI and business direction goals. Each group is given the opportunity to deliver events and educational programs throughout the year. Our corporate holiday calendar and events are inclusive of a range of identities and backgrounds, such as the inclusion of a variety of religious holidays such as Eid al-Fitr, Diwali, Christmas and others. 
•Data Privacy and Cybersecurity. We know that our success is predicated on members trusting us to responsibly manage their most sensitive data and keep it safe and secure. Our data privacy and information security organizations work with business units from design to delivery, keeping our members in mind at every step. Our information security team is led by our Vice President of Information Security. Our Information Security Management System has achieved ISO 27001 and SOC 2 Type II certification, and we achieved HITRUST certification at the end of 2022. The team’s primary focus is securing our platforms through which most of our services are delivered, alongside strengthening our data-centric security approach. Our mindset of “security by design” means that security is considered a quality aspect of our product, embedded in product design from the outset, rather than added as an overlay post-design. Our aim is to create products that are resilient in the face of escalating global cybersecurity threats. Our Data Privacy team is led by our Data Protection Officer. The team helps us to uphold members’ right to privacy and control of their data. We seek to provide transparency and visibility into our data collection and use activities, such as product improvement and marketing. We are also mindful of our key stakeholders, who reside around the world, and therefore, we strive to identify and comply with applicable cross-border regulations, such as HIPAA, GDPR/U.K. GDPR, keeping current through horizon scanning and risk register maintenance.
Our Governance Pillar is focused on our commitments to compliance, ethics and enterprise risk management.
•Ethical Conduct. We aim to uphold the highest standards of ethical business conduct, integrity and responsibility by having employees strictly adhere to our policies that include our Code of Ethics and Conduct, Global Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy, and Corporate Whistleblower Policy. To promote a culture of compliance and ethics, in 2022, we engaged our employees in a Compliance & Ethics Week, which brought meaningful attention, recognition, and reminders that compliance and ethics matters to our organization running effectively, and for the best interests of the patients we serve.

A GRC team committee meets quarterly and reports to the audit committee of our board of directors.
All of our actions and each of our ESG pillars are underpinned by our vision to be a leading digital-first, value-based care company where healthcare revolves around the patient. 
Regulatory Environment
The healthcare industry and the practice of medicine are governed by an extensive and complex framework of federal and state laws, which continue to evolve and change over time. The costs and resources necessary to comply with these laws are significant. Our profitability depends in part upon our ability, and that of our affiliated providers and independent contractors, to operate in compliance with applicable laws and to maintain all applicable licenses. A review of our operations by regulatory authorities could result in determinations that could adversely affect our operations, or the healthcare legal or regulatory environment coul0d change in ways that restrict or otherwise impact our operations. To the extent that any of our employees or third-party contractors engages in any misconduct or activity in violation of an applicable law, we may be subject to increased liability under the law or increased government scrutiny. If any action is instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, such action could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions. Our operations may be adversely affected or disrupted due to restrictions imposed on third parties. Complying with any new legislation and regulations could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.
As a digital health or a telehealth platform company, our operations are subject to United States federal, state and local and international regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business. Those laws and rules continue to evolve, and we therefore devote significant resources to monitoring developments in healthcare and medical practice regulation. As the applicable laws and rules change, we are likely to make conforming modifications in our business processes from time to time. In some jurisdictions where we operate, neither our current nor our anticipated business model has been the subject of formal judicial or administrative interpretation. We cannot be certain that a review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in determinations that could adversely affect our operations or that the healthcare regulatory environment will not change in a way that impacts our operations.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in the United States, state and federal regulatory authorities temporarily loosened or waived certain regulatory requirements in order to increase the availability of telehealth services for the COVID-19 public health emergency. For example, many state governors issued executive orders permitting physicians and other healthcare professionals licensed in other states to practice in their state without any additional licensure or by using a temporary, expedited or abbreviated licensure or registration process. In addition, changes were made to the Medicare and Medicaid programs (through legislative changes, and the exercise of regulatory discretion and authority) to increase access to telehealth services by, among other things, increasing reimbursement, permitting the enrollment of out of state providers and eliminating prior authorization requirements. For example, on November 19, 2021, CMS published a final rule announcing policy changes for Medicare payments under the Physician Fee Schedule that, among other changes, allow certain services to remain on the Medicare telehealth list through December 31, 2023. Moreover, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 extended many telehealth flexibility waivers through December 31, 2024. It is uncertain how long these COVID-19 related regulatory changes will remain in effect and whether they will continue beyond this public health emergency period.
We believe that a return to the status quo would not have a materially negative impact on any commercial agreements we entered into during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. Each of these agreements has a defined term and virtually none allow for immediate termination for convenience by the customer in question. For many healthcare companies engaging in telehealth, the most significant potential concern about returning to the status quo is that restrictions on the reimbursement of telehealth visits to Medicare beneficiaries could be reimposed. We do not believe that the visit volume on our platform or visit revenue will materially decrease following a return to the status quo from a regulatory perspective.
Medical Provider Licensing, Practice of Medicine and Related Laws
23 


Table of Contents



The delivery of health care services is subject to state, federal, and local certification and licensing laws, regulations, approvals and standards, relating to, among other things, the standard or adequacy of medical care, the practice of medicine (including the provision of remote care), equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, and the prerequisites for the prescription of medication and ordering of tests. The application of some of these laws to telehealth is unclear and subject to differing interpretations.
Physicians who provide professional medical services to a patient via telehealth must, in most instances, hold a valid license to practice medicine in the state or local jurisdiction in which the patient is located. We have established systems to confirm our affiliated physicians are appropriately licensed under applicable state or local law and that their provision of telehealth to members is delivered in compliance with applicable rules governing telehealth, although these subjects necessarily depend in some instances on collection of accurate information from patients. Depending on the jurisdiction, failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in licensure actions against the physicians, our services being found to be non-reimbursable, or prior payments being subject to recoupment, an interruption of the services we deliver, and/or civil, criminal or administrative penalties.
Corporate Practice of Medicine Laws in the United States; Fee Splitting
State corporate practice laws prohibit lay entities (i.e., entities that are not owned by a licensed healthcare professional, like us) from practicing medicine. To comply with the requirements of these prohibitions, we contract with affiliated physician organizations to provide health care services to customers and members. Under these arrangements, our platform is used by the affiliated physician organizations to facilitate the delivery of telehealth services by the affiliated physician organizations and their patients in accordance with the customer and member contracts. Under these arrangements we also provide our affiliated physician organizations with billing, scheduling and a wide range of other administrative and management services, and they pay us for those services via management and other service fees. These arrangements are also subject to state fee splitting and state and federal anti-kickback and similar laws that restrict or define the kinds of financial relationships we can have with our affiliated physician organizations.
State corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting laws and rules vary from state to state, and from federal anti-kickback prohibitions. In addition, these requirements are subject to interpretation and enforcement by state regulators. Some of these requirements may apply to us even if we do not have a physical presence in the state, based solely on our engagement of a provider licensed in the state or the provision of telehealth to a resident of the state. Thus, regulatory authorities or other parties, including our providers, may assert that, despite these arrangements, we are engaged in the prohibited corporate practice of medicine or that our contractual arrangements with affiliated physician groups constitute unlawful fee splitting. In such event, failure to comply could lead to significant adverse judicial or administrative action against us and/or our affiliated providers, civil, criminal or administrative penalties, receipt of cease and desist orders from state regulators, loss of provider licenses, the need to make changes to the terms of engagement of our providers that interfere with our business, and other materially adverse consequences.
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws
The U.S. healthcare industry is heavily regulated and closely scrutinized by federal, state and local governments. Comprehensive statutes and regulations govern the manner in which we provide and bill for services and collect reimbursement from governmental programs and private payers, our contractual relationships with our providers, vendors and customers, our marketing activities and other aspects of our operations. Of particular importance are:
•the federal physician self-referral law, commonly referred to as the Stark Law, that, subject to limited exceptions, prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity for the provision of certain “designated health services” if the physician or a member of such physician’s immediate family has a direct or indirect financial relationship (including an ownership interest or a compensation arrangement) with the entity, and prohibit the entity from billing Medicare or Medicaid for such designated health services. The Stark Law is violated if the financial arrangement does not meet an applicable exception, regardless of any intent by the parties to induce or reward referrals or the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral;
•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute that prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any bribe, kickback, rebate or other remuneration (i) in return for referring or to induce the referral of an individual for the furnishing, or arranging for the furnishing, of items or services paid for in whole or in part by any federal health care program, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and (ii) ordering, leasing, purchasing or recommending or arranging for the ordering, purchasing or leasing of items, services, good, or facility paid for in whole or in part by any federal health care program, such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not

need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;
•the criminal healthcare fraud provisions of HIPAA and related rules that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any material false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;
•the federal False Claims Act that imposes civil liability on individuals or entities that, among other things, knowingly submit false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government, or knowingly make, or cause to be made, a false statement in order to have a false claim paid, or retain identified Medicare or Medicaid overpayments and allows for qui tam or whistleblower suits by private individuals on behalf of the government. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or the Stark Law constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;
•various federal healthcare-focused criminal laws that impose criminal liability for intentionally submitting false or fraudulent claims, or making false statements, to the government;
•reassignment of payment rules that prohibit certain types of billing and collection practices in connection with claims payable by the Medicare or Medicaid programs;
•similar state law provisions pertaining to anti-kickback, self-referral and false claims issues, some of which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any payer, including patients and commercial insurers;
•state laws that prohibit general business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine, controlling physicians’ medical decisions or engaging in some practices such as splitting fees with physicians;
•state laws, regulations, interpretative guidance, and policies requiring certain modality and other actions to establish a provider-patient relationship, deliver care, or prescribe medications as part of a telehealth service;
•state laws, regulations and policies relating to licensure and the practice of telehealth services across state lines;
•state laws, regulations, interpretative guidance, and policies regarding the dispensing or delivery of medications and devices;
•state laws, regulations, interpretative guidance, and policies regarding reporting requirements and patient consent, education, and follow-up related to treatment, including treatment and education for certain specific topics, such as, contraception, HIV and other STIs and state reporting for HIV, STIs, and infectious diseases;
•laws that regulate debt collection practices as applied to our debt collection practices;
•a provision of the Social Security Act that imposes penalties on healthcare providers who fail to disclose, or refund known overpayments;
•federal and state laws that prohibit providers from billing and receiving payment from Medicare and Medicaid for services unless the services are medically necessary, adequately and accurately documented, and billed using codes that accurately reflect the type and level of services rendered;
•federal and state laws and policies that require healthcare providers to maintain licensure, certification or accreditation to enroll and participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, to report certain changes in their operations to the agencies that administer these programs; and
•with respect to medical devices such as our Higi Smart Health Stations, FDA authority over medical device marketing, including assessment and oversight of safety and effectiveness and over “promotional labeling,” and FTC authority over “advertising.”
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. We have implemented a compliance program to maintain compliance with these laws, however instances of non-compliance may

prove costly. Failure to comply with these laws and other laws can result in civil and criminal penalties such as fines, damages, overpayment, recoupment, imprisonment, loss of enrollment status and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Medicare and Medicaid programs represent a large portion of our revenue in the United States and exclusion from future participation in these programs would significantly reduce our revenue for years to come. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are sometimes open to a variety of interpretations. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations to our business or any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements could create liability for us and negatively affect our business. Any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business and result in adverse publicity.
To enforce compliance with the federal laws, the DOJ and the OIG have recently increased their scrutiny of healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Dealing with investigations can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert management’s attention from the business. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, because of the potential for large monetary exposure under the federal False Claims Act, which provides for treble damages and significant penalties per false claim or statement, healthcare providers often resolve allegations without admissions of liability for significant and material amounts to avoid the uncertainty of treble damages that may be awarded in litigation proceedings. Such settlements often contain additional compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree, settlement agreement or corporate integrity agreement. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ compliance with the healthcare reimbursement rules and fraud and abuse laws.
The laws, regulations and standards governing the provision of healthcare services may change significantly in the future. On June 24, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, holding that the Constitution of the United States does not confer a right to obtain an abortion, and overturning both Roe v. Wade (1973) and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992). As a practical matter, the decision will make it difficult or impossible for some pregnant individuals to obtain certain sexual or reproductive health services in a substantial number of U.S. states. 
The Dobbs decision has triggered widespread legal uncertainty concerning the delivery of reproductive and family planning services. About half of the U.S. states are expected to or already have laws that prohibit or heavily limit abortion services. These state laws largely regulate healthcare providers and patients, although some state laws capture other parties that “aid and abet” the violation of these laws. However, some of these laws are being challenged in state and federal courts on various legal grounds, the U.S. President signed an executive order on July 8, 2022 aimed at protecting abortion rights, and a number of states are following suit by passing legislation to protect patients who seek abortion services.
Our business has been adversely impacted by the Dobbs decision because we must now invest, and expect to need to continue to invest, substantial resources to monitor the status of legal developments that may impact our and our clinicians’ ability to provide telehealth services related to sexual and reproductive health. If we fail to fully comply with any of these changing laws to the extent that they apply to our business, as a result of ambiguity in the law or otherwise, we may be subject to monetary liabilities, injunctions or other negative consequences. In addition, changes in insurance coverage for sexual and reproductive health services under health plans that we contract with could adversely impact our ability to provide and be paid for such services. We cannot assure you that any new or changed healthcare laws, regulations or standards will not materially adversely affect our business. We cannot assure you that a review of our business by judicial, law enforcement, regulatory or accreditation authorities will not result in a determination that could adversely affect our operations.
Additionally, the healthcare industry is subject to antitrust scrutiny. The federal government and most states have enacted antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive. The FTC, the Antitrust Division of the DOJ and state Attorneys General actively review and, in some cases, take enforcement action against business conduct and acquisitions in the healthcare industry. Private parties harmed by alleged anti-competitive conduct can also bring antitrust suits. Violations of antitrust laws may be punishable by substantial penalties, including significant monetary fines and treble damages, civil penalties, criminal sanctions and consent decrees and injunctions prohibiting certain activities or requiring divestiture or discontinuance of business operations. If antitrust enforcement authorities conclude that we violate any antitrust laws, we could be subject to enforcement actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

Healthcare Regulation Worldwide
United Kingdom
The regulator of health services at a system level in England is the CQC which is an executive non-departmental public body of the Department of Health and Social Care of the U.K. Any provider of certain regulated healthcare activities in England must be registered with the CQC, and it is an offense for an unregistered person to provide such services. The CQC monitors, inspects and regulates such providers to make sure they meet fundamental standards of quality and safety and it publishes what it finds, including performance ratings to help people choose care including the standards set out in the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014 and Quality Commission (Registration) Regulations 2009, each as amended from time to time.
Where a CQC inspection finds deficiencies in the service provision, it will make recommendations for improvement and the CQC generally aims to work in cooperation with healthcare providers to ensure voluntary compliance. However, where this is not possible, the CQC has powers to take enforcement action, including:
•issuing requirement notices or warning notices to set out what improvements a provider must make;
•making changes to a provider’s registration to limit what they may do;
•issuing cautions or fines; and/or
•prosecuting cases where people are harmed or placed in danger of harm.
On July 6, 2021, a new Health and Care Bill was published setting out key legislative proposals to reform the delivery and organization of health services in England, promote integrated services, and ensure a focus on improving health rather than simply providing health care services. Several of this Health and Care Bill’s proposals have been informed by NHS’s recommendations and its purpose is to enable increased sharing and more effective use of data across the health and adult social care system. The proposed legislation contains new powers for the U.K. Secretary of State over the health and care system, and targeted changes to public health, social care, and quality and safety matters. The provisions contained in the Health and Care Bill allow NHS Digital to require information from private health care providers and enable a consistent approach to the use of data supporting improved safety and quality across private and NHS health services. The Health and Care Bill is currently being debated in the U.K. Parliament and if passed in 2022, service providers will need to comply with relevant requirements.
The MHRA regulates the elements of our products which are categorized as medical devices. See “— Medical Device Regulation — U.K. Medical Device Regulation” below.
Canada
The healthcare regulatory requirements in Canada apply primarily to individual practitioners rather than at a system level to service providers. Within primary care, the main requirement is that the individual practitioner is in good standing with the relevant provincial professional regulatory body (generally the provincial College of Physicians). As a healthcare services and technology provider, we are not subject to such regulatory oversight.
Rwanda
Our services in Rwanda are regulated by the Rwandan Ministry of Health, both through its overall responsibility for healthcare provision within Rwanda and through contractual mechanisms contained within its contract with us. 
Medical Device Regulation 
Some of our digital software products are considered medical devices in the United Kingdom and the European Union. Specifically, our Symptom Checker (“Triage”) and our Health Assessment tool (“Healthcheck”) are registered as medical devices with the MHRA and the Irish Health Products Regulatory Authority. Both products are placed on the U.K. and EU market bearing the European Conformity Marking (“CE mark”), indicating conformity to EU medical device legislation; both current products are placed on the market under Council Directive 93/42/EEC (the “EU Medical Devices Directive”). However, neither Triage nor Healthcheck has been independently assessed and certified by a notified body. 
27 


Table of Contents



Triage and Healthcheck are considered Class I medical devices falling under Rule 12 of Annex IX of the EU Medical Devices Directive. We are seeking EU certification from a notified body for Triage under the EU Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation No. 2017/745).
Our current digital software products are not considered medical devices in other jurisdictions where the products are marketed, including Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines, Taiwan, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Canada and Rwanda. Babylon has confirmed the regulatory position in these jurisdictions with local regulatory experts or regulators.
United States Medical Device Regulation
The FDA has authority to regulate medical devices, which are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation including with respect to their design, development, manufacturing, testing, labeling, packaging, safety, efficacy, premarket review, marketing, sales, distribution, import and export. A “device” is broadly defined under the FDCA to mean an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component part or accessory which is, among other things, intended for use in the diagnosis of diseases or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease, or which is intended to affect the structure or function of the body and does not achieve its primary intended purpose through chemical action and is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of such purpose. The FDA considers certain software functions with these intended uses to constitute devices. However, the 21st Century Cures Act amended the FDCA to exclude from the definition of a “device” certain types of software, including software used for administrative support of a healthcare facility; software intended for maintaining or encouraging a healthy lifestyle and unrelated to the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, prevention, or treatment of a disease or condition; certain software intended to transfer, store, convert formats, or display the equivalent of paper medical charts; and software designed for transferring, storing, or displaying medical device data or in vitro diagnostic data; and certain clinical decision support software.
In addition, the FDA has issued guidance establishing certain policies pursuant to which it has indicated it will exercise enforcement discretion and will not apply its regulatory authorities with respect to certain kinds of software that may otherwise fall within the definition of a device. For example, the FDA has established a compliance policy for certain products that may fall within the definition of a device, but that are intended for only “general wellness use” and present a low risk to the safety of users and other persons. The FDA defines a “general wellness use” to be (i) an intended use that relates to maintaining or encouraging a general state of health or a healthy activity, or (ii) an intended use that relates the role of healthy lifestyle with helping to reduce the risk or impact of certain chronic diseases or conditions and where it is well understood and accepted that healthy lifestyle choices may play an important role in health outcomes for the disease or condition. For such low-risk products, the FDA does not intend to examine whether the product constitutes a medical device, and if the product is a medical device, whether the product complies with the premarket review and post-market regulatory requirements of the FDCA. As such, if a medical device falls within the definition of a “low risk general wellness product,” the product may be subject to enforcement discretion under the FDA’s compliance policy for such products, meaning that the FDA will not enforce its medical device authorities with respect to that product. In addition, the FDA has established an enforcement discretion policy for certain mobile medical apps that otherwise fall within the definition of a medical device but do not pose a risk to patient safety in the event of a failure to function as intended.
Medical devices that do not fall within enforcement discretion policies may be subject to the requirement for premarket review by the FDA through either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, de novo classification, or approval of a premarket approval application (“PMA”). Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes — Class I, Class II or Class III — depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s general controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries, and FDA guidance documents. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use

advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Manufacturers of medical devices placed into Class III can also request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low-to-moderate risk and do not have an appropriate predicate device. After a device is authorized for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
•establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
•QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
•labeling and marketing regulations, which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading, fairly balanced and provide adequate directions for use and that all claims are substantiated, and also prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; FDA guidance on off-label dissemination of information and responding to unsolicited requests for information;
•clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices;
•medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
•correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
•complying with requirements governing Unique Device Identifiers on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database;
•the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and
•post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
Manufacturers of medical device products marketed in the United States are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. Device manufacturers are also subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers.
If the FDA determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including a determination that our software products require prior FDA clearance or approval to be legally marketed in the United States, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions: warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products; operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing or delaying requests for marketing authorization of new products or modified products; withdrawing marketing authorizations that have already been granted; refusal to grant export or import approvals for our products; or criminal prosecution.
Regulation of Medical Devices in the European Union
The EU has adopted specific directives and regulations regulating the design, manufacture, clinical investigation, conformity assessment, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Until May 25, 2021, medical devices were regulated by the EU Medical Devices Directive which has been repealed and replaced by the EU Medical Devices Regulation. Our products have been certified under the EU Medical Devices Directive whose regime is described below.

However, as of May 26, 2021, some of the EU Medical Devices Regulation requirements apply in place of the corresponding requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive with regard to registration of economic operators and of
devices, post-market surveillance and vigilance requirements. Pursuing marketing of medical devices in the EU will notably require that our devices be certified under the new regime set forth in the EU Medical Devices Regulation when our current certificates expire.
Medical Devices Directive
Under the EU Medical Devices Directive, all medical devices placed on the market in the EU must meet the relevant essential requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Directive, including the requirement that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performance intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured, and packaged in a suitable manner. The European Commission has adopted various standards applicable to medical devices. These include standards governing common requirements, such as sterilization and safety of medical electrical equipment and product standards for certain types of medical devices. There are also harmonized standards relating to design and manufacture. While not mandatory, compliance with these standards is viewed as the easiest way to satisfy the essential requirements as a practical matter as it creates a rebuttable presumption that the device satisfies that essential requirement.
To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Directive, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its (risk) classification. As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the essential requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use, that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can self-assess the conformity of its products with the essential requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility or metrology), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. Notified bodies are independent organizations designated by EU member states to assess the conformity of devices before being placed on the market. A notified body would typically audit and examine a product’s technical dossiers and the manufacturers’ quality system (the notified body must presume that quality systems which implement the relevant harmonized standards — which is ISO 13485:2016 for Medical Devices Quality Management Systems — conform to these requirements). If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU. 
Throughout the term of the certificate of conformity, the manufacturer will be subject to periodic surveillance audits to verify continued compliance with the applicable requirements. In particular, there will be a new audit by the notified body before it will renew the relevant certificate(s).
Medical Devices Regulation
The regulatory landscape related to medical devices in the EU recently evolved. On April 5, 2017, the EU Medical Devices Regulation was adopted with the aim of ensuring better protection of public health and patient safety. The EU Medical Devices Regulation establishes a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EU for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. Unlike the EU Medical Devices Directive, the EU Medical Devices Regulation is directly applicable in EU member states without the need for member states to implement into national law. This aims at increasing harmonization across the EU. The EU Medical Devices Regulation became effective on May 26, 2021. The new Regulation among other things:
•strengthens the rules on placing devices on the market (e.g., reclassification of certain devices and wider scope than the EU Medical Devices Directive) and reinforces surveillance once they are available;
•establishes explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;
•establishes explicit provisions on importers’ and distributors’ obligations and responsibilities;
30 


Table of Contents



•imposes an obligation to identify a responsible person who is ultimately responsible for all aspects of compliance with the requirements of the new regulation;
•improves the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through the introduction of a unique identification number, to increase the ability of manufacturers and regulatory authorities to trace specific devices through the supply chain and to facilitate the prompt and efficient recall of medical devices that have been found to present a safety risk;
•sets up a central database (Eudamed) to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and
•strengthens rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo a clinical evaluation consultation procedure by experts before they are placed on the market.
Devices lawfully placed on the market pursuant to the EU Medical Devices Directive prior to May 26, 2021 may generally continue to be made available on the market or put into service until May 26, 2025, provided that the requirements of the transitional provisions are fulfilled. In particular, the certificate in question must still be valid. However, even in this case, manufacturers must comply with a number of new or reinforced requirements set forth in the EU Medical Devices Regulation, in particular the obligations described below.
The EU Medical Devices Regulation requires that before placing a device, other than a custom-made device, on the market, manufacturers (as well as other economic operators such as authorized representatives and importers) must register by submitting identification information to the electronic system (Eudamed), unless they have already registered. The information to be submitted by manufacturers (and authorized representatives) also includes the name, address and contact details of the person or persons responsible for regulatory compliance. The new Regulation also requires that before placing a device, other than a custom-made device, on the market, manufacturers must assign a unique identifier to the device and provide it along with other core data to the unique device identifier (“UDI”) database. These new requirements aim at ensuring better identification and traceability of the devices. Each device — and as applicable, each package — will have a UDI composed of two parts: a device identifier (“UDI-DI”) specific to a device, and a production identifier (“UDI-PI”) to identify the unit producing the device. Manufacturers are also notably responsible for entering the necessary data on Eudamed, which includes the UDI database, and for keeping it up to date. The obligations for registration in Eudamed will become applicable at a later date (as Eudamed is not yet fully functional). Until Eudamed is fully functional, the corresponding provisions of the EU Medical Devices Directive continue to apply for the purpose of meeting the obligations laid down in the provisions regarding exchange of information, including, and in particular, information regarding registration of devices and economic operators.
All manufacturers placing medical devices on the market in the EU must comply with the EU medical device vigilance system which has been reinforced by the EU Medical Devices Regulation. Under this system, serious incidents and Field Safety Corrective Actions (“FSCAs”) must be reported to the relevant authorities of the EU member states. These reports will have to be submitted through Eudamed — once functional — and aim to ensure that, in addition to reporting to the relevant authorities of the EU member states, other actors such as the economic operators in the supply chain will also be informed. Until Eudamed is fully functional, the corresponding provisions of the EU Medical Devices Directive continue to apply. A serious incident is defined as any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics or performance of a device made available on the market, including use-error due to ergonomic features, as well as any inadequacy in the information supplied by the manufacturer and any undesirable side-effect, which, directly or indirectly, might have led or might lead to the death of a patient or user or of other persons or to a temporary or permanent serious deterioration of a patient’s, user’s or other person’s state of health or a serious public health threat. Manufacturers are required to take FSCAs defined as any corrective action for technical or medical reasons to prevent or reduce a risk of a serious incident associated with the use of a medical device that is made available on the market. An FSCA may include the recall, modification, exchange, destruction or retrofitting of the device. FSCAs must be communicated by the manufacturer or its legal representative to its customers and/or to the end users of the device through Field Safety Notices. For similar serious incidents that occur with the same device or device type and for which the root cause has been identified or a FSCA implemented or where the incidents are common and well documented, manufacturers may provide periodic summary reports instead of individual serious incident reports.
The advertising and promotion of medical devices is subject to some general principles set forth in EU legislation. According to the EU Medical Devices Regulation, only devices that are CE-marked may be marketed and advertised in the EU in accordance with their intended purpose. Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, while not specific to the advertising of medical devices, also 
31 


Table of Contents



apply to the advertising thereof and contain general rules, for example, requiring that advertisements are evidenced, balanced and not misleading. Specific requirements are defined at a national level. EU member states’ laws related to the advertising and promotion of medical devices, which vary between jurisdictions, may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of products to the general public and may impose limitations on promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
Many EU member states have adopted specific anti-gift statutes that further limit commercial practices for medical devices, in particular vis-à-vis healthcare professionals and organizations. Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities and many EU member states have adopted national “Sunshine Acts” which impose reporting and transparency requirements (often on an annual basis), similar to the requirements in the United States, on medical device manufacturers. Certain countries also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs.
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA, which consists of the 27 EU Member States plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
U.K. Medical Device Regulation
Since January 1, 2021, the MHRA has become the sovereign regulatory authority responsible for Great Britain (i.e., England, Wales and Scotland) medical device market according to the requirements provided in the Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended) that sought to give effect to the three pre-existing EU directives governing active implantable medical devices, general medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices whereas Northern Ireland continues to be governed by EU rules according to the Northern Ireland Protocol. Following the end of the Brexit transitional period on January 1, 2021, new regulations require medical devices to be registered with the MHRA (but manufacturers were given a grace period of four to 12 months to comply with the new registration process) before being placed on Great Britain market. The MHRA only registers devices where the manufacturer or their U.K. Responsible Person has a registered place of business in the U.K. Manufacturers based outside the U.K. need to appoint a U.K. Responsible Person that has a registered place of business in the U.K. to register devices with the MHRA in line with the grace periods. Additionally, U.K.-based notified bodies, which were designated to independently assess the conformity of certain products requiring CE marking before being placed on the EU market, are now no longer established in the EU, and accordingly, the conformity assessments carried out by such U.K. bodies, including those assessments carried out prior to January 1, 2021, are no longer valid for the EU compliance regime. Manufacturers whose products currently rely on third-party conformity assessments carried out by U.K. notified bodies now require new conformity assessments to be carried out by EU-based notified bodies in order to ensure continuing compliance with the EU regime and to continue to place those products on the EU market. By July 1, 2023, in Great Britain, all medical devices will require a UKCA (“U.K. Conformity Assessed”) mark but CE marks issued by EU notified bodies will remain valid until this time. Manufacturers may choose to use the UKCA mark on a voluntary basis until June 30, 2023. However, UKCA marking will not be recognized in the EU. The rules for placing medical devices on the market in Northern Ireland, which is part of the U.K., differ from those in the rest of the U.K. Compliance with this legislation is a prerequisite to be able to affix the UKCA mark to our products, without which they cannot be sold or marketed in Great Britain.
An MHRA public consultation was opened until the end of November 2021 on the post-Brexit regulatory framework for medical devices and diagnostics. MHRA seeks to amend the U.K. Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (which are based on EU legislation, primarily the EU Medical Devices Directive, the EU Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive and the EU In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive), in particular to create a new access pathways to support innovation, create an innovative framework for regulating software and artificial intelligence as medical devices, reform in vitro diagnostic medical devices regulation, and foster sustainability through the reuse and remanufacture of medical devices. The regime is expected to come into force in July 2023, coinciding with the end of the acceptance period for EU CE marks in Great Britain, subject to appropriate transitional arrangements. The consultation indicated that the MHRA will publish guidance in relation to the changes to the regulatory framework and may rely more heavily on guidance to add flexibility to the regime.
In addition, the trade deal between the U.K. and the EU generally provides for cooperation and exchange of information between the parties in the areas of product safety and compliance, including market surveillance, enforcement activities and measures, standardization-related activities, exchanges of officials, and coordinated product recalls. As such, processes for compliance and reporting should reflect requirements from regulatory authorities.

Under the terms of the Northern Ireland Protocol, Northern Ireland follows EU rules on medical devices and devices marketed in Northern Ireland require assessment according to the EU regulatory regime. Such assessment may be conducted by an EU notified body, in which case a CE mark is required before placing the device on the market in the EU or Northern Ireland. Alternatively, if a U.K. notified body conducts such assessment, a ‘UKNI’ mark applied and the device may only be placed on the market in Northern Ireland and not the EU.
ISO 13485
Regulatory requirements are increasingly stringent throughout every step of a product’s life cycle, including service and delivery. Increasingly, organizations in the industry are expected to demonstrate their quality management processes and ensure best practice in everything they do. ISO 13485, issued by the International Organization for Standardization, or (“ISO”), is the medical device industry’s internationally agreed standard, setting out the requirements for a quality management system specific to the medical devices industry.
Our quality management system, in which our medical devices have been developed, has been independently assessed and certified by a notified body to EN ISO 13485:2016 standard.
DCB 0129/0160 (National Health Service U.K. standards for design and implementation of digital health technologies)
DCB 0129 is the clinical risk management standard with which manufacturers of health IT systems and apps need to comply. The standard is governed by NHS Digital and compliance is mandatory under the U.K. Health and Social Care Act 2012. Digital health technology can introduce as well as mitigate clinical risk. NHS Digital requires that organizations who manufacture health IT systems and apps undertake a formal risk assessment and evidence the measures which have been put in place to mitigate risk. Proactively demonstrating that a product is safe helps to protect from litigation and visibly demonstrates best-practice to customers. To comply with the standard, we undertake a formal risk assessment on the product and produce three documents summarizing the outcome: the Clinical Risk Management Plan, Hazard Log and Clinical Safety Case Report.
International Regulation
We expect over time to continue to expand our operations in foreign countries through growth and acquisitions. In such a case, our international operations will be subject to different, and sometimes more stringent, legal and regulatory requirements, which vary widely by jurisdiction, including anti-corruption laws; economic sanctions laws; various privacy, insurance, tax, tariff and trade laws and regulations; corporate governance, privacy, data protection, data mining, data transfer, labor and employment, intellectual property, consumer protection and investment laws and regulations; discriminatory licensing procedures; required localization of records and funds; and limitations on dividends and repatriation of capital.
Our operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, or the Bribery Act, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute at 18 U.S.C. §201, the U.S. Travel Act, and other anti-corruption laws and anti-money laundering laws that apply in countries where we do business. The Bribery Act, the FCPA and these other anti-corruption laws generally prohibit us and our employees, agents, representatives, business partners, and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper or prohibited payments, or anything else of value, to recipients in the public or private sector in order to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. The expansion of our operations into foreign countries increases our exposure to these anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws. We sometimes leverage third parties to sell our products and conduct our business abroad. Under the Bribery Act, we may also be liable for failing to prevent a person associated with us from committing a bribery offense. We, our employees, agents, representatives, business partners and our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these employees, agents, representatives, business partners or third-party intermediaries even if we do not explicitly authorize those activities. While we have mechanisms to identify high-risk individuals and entities before contracting with them, we operate in a number of jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential Bribery Act or FCPA violations. We cannot assure you that all of our employees, agents, representatives, business partners or third-party intermediaries will not take actions that violate applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. As we increase our international sales and business, our risks under these laws may increase.

We are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States, and authorities in the European Union, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions and embargoes on certain countries and persons, anti-money laundering laws, import and customs requirements and currency exchange regulations. We may not be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all such applicable laws, which could result in our being subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses. Likewise, any investigation of any potential violations of such laws by United Kingdom, United States or other authorities could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We and our products in many cases are subject to U.S. import and export controls and trade and economic sanctions regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations, and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. These laws prohibit the shipment or provision of certain products and solutions to certain countries, governments and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. Exports of our products and services must be made in compliance with these laws and regulations when applicable. If in the future we are found to be in violation of U.S. sanctions or export control laws, it could result in civil and criminal penalties, including loss of export privileges and substantial fines for us and for the individuals working for us.
In addition, various countries regulate the import and export of certain encryption and other technology, including import and export permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our solution or permit the use of our platform in those countries.
Changes in our solution, or future changes in export and import regulations, may prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our platform globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our solution to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our platform by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell subscriptions to our platform to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solution would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.
Human Capital Management
Babylon was founded with a single purpose: to put an accessible, affordable health service into the hands of every person on Earth, and everything else flows from this: our values, the way we behave, what we expect, and the way we work and interact with each other. Our values drive our behaviors to be compassionate, inclusive, creative, tenacious, positive, and self-starting, and we look for these behaviors in our employees. 
Employees 
We employed approximately 1,895 people as of December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our global average headcount was 2,147. For the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 our global average headcount was 2,573 and 2,108, respectively. Our global workforce is comprised of approximately 70% full time employees and 30% part time employees. Within the total employee population at Babylon as of December 31, 2022, approximately 35%, 62%, and 3% of our employees worked in the U.S., U.K., or other countries, respectively. None of our employees in the U.S. are represented by unions or party to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions to operations due to labor disagreements.
Our profitability and the cost of providing our services are affected by our utilization rates of our employees in our various locations. If we are not able to maintain appropriate utilization rates for our employees involved in the delivery of our services, our profit margin and our profitability may suffer. Our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors, including:
•our ability to promptly transition our employees from completed projects to new assignments and to hire and integrate new employees;
34 


Table of Contents



•our ability to forecast demand for our services and thereby maintain an appropriate number of employees in each of our delivery locations;
•our ability to deploy employees with appropriate skills and seniority to projects;
•our ability to manage the attrition of our employees; and
•our need to devote time and resources to training, professional development and other activities that cannot be billed to our customers.
Talent Acquisition and Development
Our ability to attract a skilled workforce of engineers, mathematicians, scientists and healthcare practitioners, and a diverse workforce reflective of our members, is critical to meeting our mission and achieving results for our members, healthcare partners, shareholders and other stakeholders. Reward at Babylon helps us all share in our collective success and align long-term incentives through bonus and stock awards or options. We extend our mission to our employees, encouraging healthy lifestyles, emotional and physical well-being and a work-life balance through flexible work arrangements, healthy lifestyle perks, such as free yoga classes and healthy snacks, and health and well-being support from health advocates, mental health first aiders and well-being circles. Our Be Brilliant performance management framework supports at least annual performance reviews and career pathway mapping.
In addition, our ESG initiatives include diversity, equity and inclusion and ethical conduct as some of our focus areas with regard to talent acquisition and development. See “Business—Commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance Leadership.”
Data Privacy and Cybersecurity
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations and standards govern the collection, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information, and could apply now or in the future to our operations or the operations of our partners. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
We know that our success is predicated on members trusting us to responsibly manage their most sensitive data and keep it safe and secure. Our data privacy and information security organizations work with business units from design to delivery, keeping our members in mind at every step. Our information security team and is led by our Vice President of Information Security, who reports directly to our CTO. Our Information Security Management System has achieved ISO 27001 and SOC 2 Type II certification, and we achieved HITRUST certification at the end of 2022. The team’s primary focus is securing our platforms through which most of our services are delivered, alongside strengthening our data-centric security approach. Our mindset of “security by design” means that security is considered a quality aspect of our product, embedded in product design from the outset, rather than added as an overlay post-design. Our aim is to create products that are resilient in the face of escalating global cybersecurity threats. Our Data Privacy team is led by our Data Protection Officer, who ultimately reports to the CFO. The team helps us to uphold members’ right to privacy and control of their data. We seek to provide transparency and visibility into our data collection and use activities, such as product improvement and marketing. We are also mindful of our key stakeholders, who reside around the world, and therefore, we strive to identify and comply with applicable cross-border regulations, such as HIPAA and the GDPR / U.K. GDPR, keeping current through horizon scanning and risk register maintenance.
