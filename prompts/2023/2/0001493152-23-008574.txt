ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
 
We are a global biotech company working to unlock the potential of cell and gene therapies (“CGTs”) in an affordable and accessible format. CGTs can be centered on autologous (using the patient’s own cells) or allogenic (using master banked donor cells) and are part of a class of medicines referred to as advanced therapy medicinal products (“ATMPs”). We are mostly focused on autologous therapies that can be manufactured under processes and systems that are developed for each therapy using a closed and automated approach that is validated for compliant production near the patient for treatment of the patient at the point of care (“POCare”). This approach has the potential to overcome the limitations of traditional commercial manufacturing methods that do not translate well to commercial production of advanced therapies due to their cost prohibitive nature and complex logistics to deliver such treatments to patients (ultimately limiting the number of patients that can have access to, or can afford, these therapies).
Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products and POCare Overview
 
ATMP means one of any of the following medicinal products that are developed and commercialized for human use:
 

● | A somatic cell therapy medicinal product (“STMP”) that contains cells or tissues that have been manipulated to change their biological characteristics or cells or tissues not intended to be used for the same essential functions in the body; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | A tissue engineered product (“TEP”) that contains cells or tissues that have been modified so that they can be used to repair, regenerate, or replace human tissue; or 
● | A gene therapy medicinal product (“GTMP”) that engineers genes that lead to a therapeutic, prophylactic, or diagnostic effect and, in many cases, work by inserting “recombinant” genes into the body, usually to treat a variety of diseases, including genetic disorders, cancer, or long-term diseases. In this case, a recombinant gene is a stretch of DNA that is created in the laboratory, bringing together DNA from different sources. 

 
It is important to note that, although STMPs and GTMPs currently dominate the market, in order to access the market potential and trends in the future, other cell products are likely to be essential in all of these categories. We believe that autologous therapies represent a substantial segment of the ATMP market. Autologous therapies are produced from a patient’s own cells versus allogeneic therapies that are mass-cultivated from donor cells via the construction of master and working cell banks and are then produced on a large scale. Developers and manufacturers of ATMPs (both autologous and allogeneic) currently rely heavily on production using traditional centralized supply chains and manufacturing sites.
 
CGTs are costly and complex to produce. We also refer to CGTs as “living drugs” since they are based on maintaining the cell’s vitality. Therefore, there is no possibility to sterilize the products, since such a process involves killing any living organism. Many of these therapies require sourcing of the patient’s cells, engineering them in a sterile environment and then transplanting them back to the patient (so-called “autologous” CGT). This presents multiple logistic challenges as each patient requires their own production batch, and the current processes involve complex laboratory-based types of manipulations requiring highly trained lab technicians. We are leveraging a unique approach to therapy production using our POCare Platform to potentially overcome some of the development and supply chain challenges of affordably bringing CGT to patients.

To achieve these goals, we have developed a collaborative worldwide network of research institutes and hospitals who are engaged in the POCare model (“POCare Network”), and a pipeline of licensed POCare advanced therapies that can be processed and produced under such closed and automated processes and systems (“POCare Therapies”). We are developing our pipeline of advanced therapies and with the goal of entering into out-licensing agreements for these therapies.
 
We believe that, for this industry to prosper, it must be based on utilizing a standardized platform. Cellular therapies, though defined as drug products, conceptually differ from other drug modalities. The way these drug products are produced is inherently different from producing existing drugs. They are based on reprogramming of cells sourced from the patient or from a donor. They are not composed of purchased chemical components such as typical pharmaceuticals, nor are they harvested in large quantities from genetically engineered cell lines and then sterilized such as typical biotech products. These “living drug” products are, in most cases, produced per patient individually in a highly sterile and controlled environment, and their efficacy is optimized when administered a short time following production as fresh product.
 
To advance the execution of our goal of bringing such therapies to market, we have designed and built our POCare Platform - a scalable infrastructure of technology and services that ensures a central quality system, replicability and standardization of infrastructure and equipment, and centralized monitoring and data management. The platform is constructed on POCare Centers that serve as hubs that implement locally our POCare quality system, Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”), training procedures, quality control testing and incoming supply of materials and oversee the actual production in the Orgenesis Mobile Processing Units & Labs (“OMPULs”). The POCare Platform is operated by Morgenesis, an Orgenesis subsidiary (see below). This platform is utilized by other parties, such as biotech companies and hospitals for the supply of their products. Morgenesis services include adapting the process to the platform and supplying the products (“POCare Services”). These are services for third party companies and for CGTs that are not necessarily based on our POCare Therapies.
 
POCare Services
 
The POCare Services that we and our affiliated entities perform include:
 

● | Process development of therapies, process adaptation, and optimization inside the OMPULs, or “OMPULization”; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Adaptation of automation and closed systems to serviced therapies; 
● | Incorporation of the serviced therapies compliant with GMP in the OMPULs that we designed and built; 
● | Tech transfers and training of local teams for the serviced therapies at the POCare Centers; 
● | Processing and supply of the therapies and required supplies under GMP conditions within our POCare Network, including required quality control testing; and 
● | Contract Research Organization (“CRO”) services for clinical trials. 

 
The POCare Services are performed in decentralized hubs that provide harmonized and standardized services to customers (“POCare Centers”). We are working to expand the number and scope of our POCare Centers. We believe that this provides an efficient and scalable pathway for CGT therapies to reach patients rapidly at lowered costs. Our POCare Services are designed to allow rapid capacity expansion while integrating new technologies to bring together patients, doctors and industry partners with a goal of achieving standardized, regulated clinical development and production of therapies.

POCare Services Operations via Subsidiaries
 
We currently conduct our core business operations ourselves and through Morgenesis and its subsidiaries which are all wholly owned except as otherwise stated below (collectively, the “Subsidiaries”). The following is a description of our Subsidiaries:
 
Morgenesis LLC
 
In August 2022, we formed Morgenesis LLC, a subsidiary to hold substantially all the assets of our POCare Services. We formed Morgenesis to streamline all existing POCare Service business units into one unified entity, bringing together a full-service range of solutions for therapeutic developers for point of care treatments. The newly formalized service offering provides solutions from initial process development, regulatory strategy and implementation, “OMPULization” which includes cGMP process development, closing/automating the process, and with the end goal of optimizing full cGMP processing and supply of therapeutic product to patients at the point of care. We currently own 76.9% of Morgenesis.
 
During November 2022, we and MM OS Holdings, L.P. (“MM”), an affiliate of Metalmark Capital Partners (“Metalmark”), entered into a series of definitive agreements intended to finance, strengthen and expand our POCare Services business (the “Metalmark Investment”). Pursuant to a unit purchase agreement (the “UPA”), MM agreed to purchase 3,019,651 Class A Preferred Units of Morgenesis (the “Class A Units”), which represents 22.31% of the outstanding equity interests of Morgenesis following the initial closing, for a purchase price of $30.2 million, comprised of (i) $20 million of cash consideration and (ii) the conversion of $10.2 million of MM’s then-outstanding senior secured convertible loans previously entered into with MM. Under certain conditions related to Morgenesis’ performance among others, MM has agreed to make future payments of up to $20 million in cash for additional Class A (or Class B) Units, and/or make a one-time cash payment of $10 million to Orgenesis (the “Earnout Payment”). In connection with the entry into of the UPA, we, Morgenesis and MM entered into the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement (the “LLC Agreement”) providing for certain restrictions on the disposition of Morgenesis securities, the provisions of certain options and rights with respect to the management and operations of Morgenesis, a right for MM to exchange any units of Morgenesis for shares of Orgenesis common stock and certain other rights and obligations. In addition, MM was provided certain protective rights in Morgenesis.
 
We transferred the following subsidiaries to Morgenesis, and the proceeds of the investment will generally be used to fund the activities of Morgenesis and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 

● | Orgenesis Maryland LLC, which is the center of POCare Services activity in North America and is currently focused on setting up and providing POCare Services and cell-processing services to the POCare Network. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Tissue Genesis International LLC, which was formed in Texas in 2022, is currently focused on development of our technologies and therapies. 
● | Orgenesis Services SRL, which was incorporated in 2022 and is currently focused on expanding our POCare Network in Belgium. 
● | Orgenesis Germany GmbH, which is currently focused on providing CRO services to the POCare Network. 
● | Orgenesis Korea Co. Ltd., which is a provider of cell-processing and pre-clinical services in Korea. The Company owns 94.12% of the Korean Subsidiary. 
● | Orgenesis Biotech Israel Ltd., which is a provider of process development and cell-processing services in Israel. 

 
In December 2022, we (through our subsidiary Morgenesis) gained control over Theracell Laboratories, a Greek company currently focused on expanding our POCare Network. (See notes 12 and 13)

Integration of Custom Fit Solutions within the POCare Center
 

Our aim is to provide a pathway to bring ATMPs in the cell and gene therapy industry from research to patients worldwide through our POCare Platform. We define point of care as a process of collecting, processing, and administering cells as close as possible to the clinical setting. We believe that this approach is an attractive proposition for CGT during the clinical development stage and even more so upon market approval therapies. This will potentially help to minimize or eliminate the need for cell transportation, which is a high-risk and costly aspect of the supply chain, further allowing flexible production and patient treatment and reduce the cost and lengthy timelines associated with building additional clean rooms and complex tech transfers between production sites.
 
We believe that the existing industry paradigm in which each therapy developer invests in setting up unique infrastructure such as specialized clean rooms and production facilities is inefficient. The cost of construction, regulatory authorization and maintenance of these facilities is not only prohibitive but extremely difficult and lengthy to replicate, allowing no economies of scale. We have based the design of our POCare Platform on the concept of standardizing infrastructure by providing flexible building blocks through the POCare Centers and OMPULs, which allows for quick expansion at multiple locations.
 

● | Local Decentralization: POCare Centers are set up in preferred regions, based on nearby hospitals’ capacity needs, and support the POCare Services model by providing POCare Services. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Global Harmonization: The POCare Platform overcomes conventional processing challenges by enabling high quality standards and sterile, scalable onsite processing of CGTs orchestrated by the POCare Centers to service local hospitals. Processing infrastructure is harmonized and reproducible using the OMPUL. The use of an OMPUL can shorten implementation time from approximately 18-24 months to approximately 3-9 months, offers a more cost-effective environment and enables local scalability by connecting additional OMPULs. The network structure is supported and connected by the centralization of the harmonized best industry practices and standards to meet the highest quality standards (“QMS”, Quality Management System). Further global harmonization is implemented through standardization of the training programs, centralized data management and a unified supply chain. 
● | OMPULization of Therapies: Strong process development capabilities are critical for any CGT to scale. All therapeutic candidates must undergo some level of process development to move from the discovery phase to the clinical phase, if only to establish the same protocols under GMP. The POCare Platform takes process development to the next level, implementing a process we call OMPULization. OMPULization includes unitizing the process to the exact specifications of the OMPUL so it can be rapidly implemented in OMPULs around the world. In addition, OMPULization incorporates the latest technology solutions to close and automate the process whenever possible. 

 
Integrated closed and automated processing systems require fewer full-time employees (“FTEs”) to produce GMP batches, resulting in lower cost of goods and a process that has the ability to scale in sync with market demand. Full automation may not be necessary for all clinical phases, but it is important to plan for future incorporation. To this end, we have invested time and capital into evaluating relevant technology for CGT processing and have developed proprietary equipment that did not exist in the marketplace.

We aim to build value in various aspects of our company ranging from supply related processes including development and distribution systems, clinical and regulatory services, engineering and devices such as OMPULs discussed below and delivery systems. Therapies serviced include immuno-oncology, anti-aging, metabolic, dermatology, orthopedic, as well as regenerative technologies.
 
The POCare Platform is a unique globally harmonized and decentralized CGT-processing infrastructure that offers cost-effective processing capacities with ease for scalability and reproducibility. By producing personalized cell and gene therapies (CGTs) utilizing the POCare Platform, we are able to add new capacity within months instead of years. Over time, we have worked to develop and validate POCare Technologies that can be combined within mobile production units for advanced therapies.
 
We have made significant investments in the implementation of several therapy types in OMPULs and have made significant progress in the validation, risk analysis, regulatory and other related tasks relating to the OMPULs. We are setting up the OMPULs through our POCare Centers. OMPULs are designed for the purpose of validation, development, performance of clinical trials, manufacturing and/or processing of potential or approved cell and gene therapy products in a safe, reliable, and cost-effective manner at the point of care, as well as the manufacturing of such CGTs in a consistent and standardized manner in all locations. The design delivers a potential industrial solution for us to deliver CGTs to most clinical institutions at the point of care.

Above are diagrams of an OMPUL and partial interior for illustrative purposes only.
 
We have finalized or are in the process of finalizing the development of several POCare Centers and adapting to the local requirements of each POCare Center with the target of achieving a capacity to process and supply CGTs per production contracts. As we expand operations, we expect that the OMPUL setup costs will decline over time. Most of our POCare revenue to date is in support of the implementation of technologies and therapies in the OMPULs and production at the POCare Sites.
 
We have established POCare Centers in several locations globally, in which we perform process development and manufacturing activities for several types of CGT products. For example, in Israel, our POCare Center includes process development and QC labs, as well as OMPULs located at a hospital site in the center of Israel and an additional OMPUL in preparation for an additional hospital. In these OMPULs, we currently manufacture TILs and CAR-T therapies for our customers. In Greece, our POCare Center includes three OMPULs installed in place and a process development lab, currently servicing two customers. Our POCare Center in Maryland, USA, includes an operating process development lab. We are also establishing cleanroom-based facility funded by a government grant. In Spain we have an OMPUL producing a clinical grade product.

As part of our POCare Services, we have developed the relevant GMP processes for a variety of therapies such as CAR-T, TILs, NK and MSC based therapies. We have developed OMPULs with the required systems for production of CAR-T, TILs and MSC products, and are working on several other therapies intended for clinical testing. TIL, CAR-Ts and MSCs were already produced in the OMPULs for our customers. We have worked closely with technology partners to adapt various systems for closed system production of the above products and continue our collaboration efforts to develop fully automated systems for integration in the OMPULs.
 
We expanded our collaboration with UC Davis and have completed the first production batch of GMP grade lentivirus to be utilized for clinical grade production of CAR-Ts. We intend to expand the collaboration to establish and validate the decentralized model of OMPUL placement in compliance with regulatory requirements. The parties aim to commercialize and install OMPULs at other sites within the State of California. We have expanded our partnership with Johns Hopkins University and are setting up a GMP facility with the support of a grant from Maryland. We are providing products to several hospitals in the U.S., are working closely with leading hospitals in Spain and Italy and are working closely with clinicians from hospitals in Israel, where we have deployed our OMPULs to set up additional clinical sites where we can provide POCare Services for our customers and partners. Based on the requests of our customers and partners, we have expanded our POCare Services to include CRO services.
 
We have collaborated closely with our Greek partner, Theracell, and have set up a partnership in Greece focusing on delivering advanced therapies to Greek hospitals. The Greek government has granted our Greek joint venture entity a “fast track” status and a supportive financial grant.
 
Our POCare Services are expanding to additional geographies, and we are providing services to the U.S., EU, and Asia.
 
POCare Therapies
 
The global CGT market is growing at a rapid pace, now with over 2,000 active clinical trials (ARM H1 2022 Report), including 200+ in Phase III and 254 new clinical trials in 2022 (ARM State of the Industry Briefing). Several biotech companies developing CGTs have been acquired by large pharma (Gilead Sciences acquired Kite Pharma, Roche acquired Spark Therapeutics, Bayer acquired AskBio) for several billion dollars before generating their first revenues. According to an article by McKinsey & Company from April 2020, CGT products account for 12 percent of the industry’s clinical and 16 percent of the preclinical pipeline. 16 of the world’s largest 20 biopharma companies now have CGT assets in their product portfolios.
 
This is a relatively new field, developing quickly in the last decade. The initial development of these therapies began at clinical research centers, based on attempts of researchers and clinicians to incorporate the scientific knowledge that accumulated from the biotechnology industry, including advancements in genetic engineering of cells, cell sourcing, tissue engineering and the medical advancements of immunology. In the early years of development, it was not even clear if such therapies would be considered a clinical treatment (such as a bone marrow transplant) or drug product such as a recombinant protean. In the last decade there has been much development in the regulatory framework required to bring such products to market, but still there is vagueness in some markets and unique regulatory pathways (such as the legal framework in the EU for hospital exemption allowing hospitals who wish to provide such therapies to their patients to take responsibility for treating patients). Though the biotech industry has embraced this new modality of drug development, they face many challenges. The pharma and biotech companies are used to centralized production and providing shelf products that can be stored and made available on demand. Their development and production teams are eager to fit these therapies into the existing well-known paradigms. This has proven to be extremely challenging, and the result has been approvals of products such as CAR-Ts for blood cancers and products for treatment of genetic diseases costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, or even over a million dollars per patient. The capacity to produce such products is limited and though they are considered a breakthrough in terms of clinical results, the high cost has been prohibitive of market acceptance.

While the biotech industry struggles to determine the best way to lower cost of goods and enable CGTs to scale, the scientific community continues to advance and push the development of such therapies to new heights. Clinicians and researchers are excited by all the new tools (new generations of industrial viruses, big data analysis for genetic and molecular data) and technologies (CRISPR, mRNA, etc.) available (often at a low cost) to perform advanced research in small labs. Most new therapies arise from academic institutes or small spinouts from such institutes. Though such research efforts may manage to progress into a clinical stage, utilizing lab based or hospital-based production solutions they lack the resources to continue the development of such drugs to market approval.
 
Historically, drug/therapeutic development has required investments of hundreds of millions of dollars to be successful. One significant cause for the high cost is that each therapy often requires unique production facilities and technologies that must be subcontracted or built. Further the cost of production during the clinical stage is extremely expensive, and the cost of the clinical trial itself is very high. Given these financial restraints, researchers and institutes hope to out- license their therapeutic products to large biotech companies or spin-out new companies and raise large fundraising rounds. However, in many cases they lack the resources and the capability to de-risk their therapeutic candidates enough to be attractive for such fundings or partnership.
 
Our POCare Network is an alternative to the traditional pathway of drug development. Orgenesis works closely with many such institutes and is in close contact with researchers in the field. The partnerships with leading hospitals and research institutes gives us a deep insight as to the developments in the field, as well as the market potential, the regulatory landscape and optimal clinical pathway to potentially bring these products to market.
 
The ability to produce these products at low cost, allows for an expedited development process and the partnership with hospitals around the globe enables joint grants and lower cost of clinical development. The POCare Therapies division reviews many therapies available for out licensing and select the ones which they believe have the highest market potential, can benefit the most from a point of care approach and have the highest chance of clinical success. It assesses such issues by utilizing its global POCare Network and its internal knowhow accumulated over a decade of involvement in the field.
 
The goal of this in-licensing is to quickly adapt such therapies to a point-of- care approach through regional partnerships, and to out-license the products for market approval in preferred geographical regions. This approach lowers overall development cost, through minimizing pre-clinical development costs incurred by us, and through receiving of the additional funding from grants and/or payments by regional partners.

Therapies in Development
 
Our cell and gene therapies pipeline includes investigational therapies and next-generation technologies that have the power to transform the way cancer and other unmet clinical needs are treated. Our pipeline is predominantly comprised of personalised autologous cell therapies, implying that patients receive cells that originate from their own body, virtually eliminating the risk of an immune response and rejection. Our promising pipeline focuses on advanced therapy medicinal products is originated from solid internal proprietary, joint ventures and in-licensing agreements with biotech companies and leading research institutes. Our main therapeutic fields encompass cell-based immuno-oncology, cell-based drug delivery platforms, regenerative medicine, anti-viral and autoimmune disease.

To gain insight into KYSLECEL patient outcomes, an observational study is expected to be initiated in the United States. In addition, to promote process development and marketing of KYSLECEL in the European Union, substantial efforts are being invested. In this regard, designated teams are being trained by Orgenesis, to manage the introduction of KYSLECEL into new markets by supporting tech transfer, as well as working on the automation of the manufacturing process. We are also considering new potential indications, as well as promoting the development of new additional biological product.
 

2. | KT-DM-103 and KT-CP-203 (3D-Printed Pancreatic Islets) 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Orgenesis, through the acquisition of Koligo, has exclusively licensed patents and technology from the University of Louisville Research Foundation, related to the revascularization and 3D printing of cells and tissues intended for transplantation (“3D-V” technology platform). Utilizing this technology, potential autologous and allogeneic pancreatic islet transplants may be implemented to treat type 1 diabetes (KT-DM-103), and chronic pancreatitis (KT-CP-203). In addition to pancreatic islet transplantation, the 3D-V technology platform may also support improved transplantation of other cell and tissue types.
 

3. | RanTop, Ranpirnase Topical Formulation 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We are developing a novel topical gel formulation of an active RNA-degrading enzyme, called Ranpirnase. Ranpirnase combats viral infections by targeting double-stranded RNA including miRNA precursors, via RNA degradation catalysis. Topical Ranpirnase demonstrated good tolerability and preliminary clinical efficacy in the treatment of HPV-associated external anogenital warts (EGW) in a Phase 2a clinical study conducted in Bolivia.
 
Following FDA positive pre-IND feedback, a dermal toxicology feasibility study was conducted, showing that Ranpirnase gel formulation was well-tolerated in repeated daily topical administration. Additionally, a sensitive Ranpirnase blood concentration bioanalytical method was established, needed for determining systemic exposure in toxicology studies for IND filing.
 
We have demonstrated in laboratory experiments the feasibility of Ranpirnase encapsulation in the Orgenesis Bioxome delivery platform, as well as an encapsulation-enhanced Ranpirnase anti-viral activity in an in vitro test. Following identification of an optimal cell source, the combined product will be further developed for oncological indications.
 

4. | Autologous Cell-Based Vaccine for protecting against SARS-CoV-2 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
AutoVac is an autologous, pan-antigenic vaccine platform. The vaccine is based on the use of a specific target for ex vivo induction of autologous cell-based vaccine that enables rapid response in times of a viral outbreak. As initial proof of concept, we are validating this novel cell-based vaccine platform against Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Preliminary in vitro results demonstrated successful immune cell activation, correlated with antigen expression. Currently, additional pre-clinical immunogenicity studies are planned for regulatory submission support, as well as regulatory and clinical strategy finalization. In addition, other viral pathogens are tested, to confirm specificity, and robustness of this vaccine platform.
 

5. | BioxomesTM as a cell-based delivery product 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Exosomes are small, membrane-enclosed extracellular vesicles, involved in cell-to-cell interactions. Exosomes may serve as a valuable therapeutic modality, given their ability to transfer a wide variety of therapeutic payloads among cells that can affect a cell in multiple ways, and can be designed to reach specific cell types. Bioxomes are biocompatible and serve as GMP/GLP-compliant exosome-like membrane nanostructures that can be produced from various cell types. To this end, we have developed a proprietary large-scale GMP-compatible manufacturing process for preparation of Bioxome, from human adipose cells, fibroblasts, blood cells, as well as plant cells.

Additionally, preliminary biodistribution studies demonstrated specific organ tropism, as well as enhanced skin penetration, when applied topically. Further biodistribution and bioavailability studies with Bioxomes, encapsulated with selected therapeutic cargos are on-going to confirm efficacy and safety. Bioxomes are planned to be utilized as the next generation biological delivery platform for Immuno-oncology indications. Currently, the regulatory strategy is being finalized according to US FDA requirements.

Revenue Model, Business Development and Licenses 
 
Our POCare Platform is comprised of three enabling components: a multitude of licensed cell based POCare Therapies to be produced in closed, automated POCare Technology systems across a collaborative POCare Network. Our therapies include, but are not limited to, autologous, cell-based immunotherapies, therapeutics for metabolic diseases, anti-viral diseases, and tissue regeneration. We are establishing and positioning the business to bring point-of-care therapies to patients in a scalable way working directly with hospitals and through regional JV partners and JVs active in autologous cell therapy product development, including facilities in various countries in North America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Australia. Our goal through the POCare Platform is to enable a rapid, globally harmonized pathway for these therapies to reach large numbers of patients at lowered costs through efficient, and decentralized production. Our POCare Network brings together industry partners, research institutes and hospitals worldwide to achieve harmonized, regulated clinical development and production of the therapies.
 
We are focused on technology in licensing and therapeutic collaborations, and we out-license therapies marketing rights and manufacturing rights to partners and/or to the JVs. In many cases, the JVs are responsible for the preparation of clinical trials, local regulatory approvals and regional marketing activities. Such licensing includes exclusive or nonexclusive, sublicensable, royalty bearing rights and license to the Orgenesis Background IP as required to manufacture, distribute and market and sell Orgenesis products within the relevant territories. In consideration of the rights and the licenses so granted, we receive a royalty in the range of ten percent of the net sales generated by the JV Entity and/or its sublicensees (as applicable) with respect to the Orgenesis products.
 
Further to revenues generated from out-licensing, we generate revenues from POCare Services and sales which is comprised of:

Competition in the Cell Therapy Field
 
The biopharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive. There is continuous demand for innovation and speed, and as the cell-based therapies market evolves, there is always the risk that a competitor may be able to develop other compounds or drugs that are able to achieve similar or better results for indications. Potential competition includes major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, universities, and other research institutions. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations with established sales forces. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies.
 
Currently, we are not aware of any other companies pursuing a business model similar to what we are developing under our POCare Platform. However, our competitors in the CGT field who are significantly larger and better capitalized than us could undertake strategies similar to what we are pursuing and even develop them at a much more rapid rate. These potential competitors include the same multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, universities, and other research institutions that are operating in the CGT field. In that respect, smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We will be able to protect our technology and products from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent it is covered by valid and enforceable claims of our patents or is effectively maintained as trade secrets. Patents and other proprietary rights are thus an essential element of our business.
 
Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology, and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 
In addition, we own or have exclusive rights to thirty-six (36) United States patents, seventy-five (75) foreign-issued patents, eighteen (18) pending patent applications in the United States, seventy-one (71) pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, North Korea, Panama, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, and South Korea, and eleven (11) international Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) patent applications.

Government Regulation
 
Development Business
 
We are required to comply with the regulatory requirements of various local, state, national and international regulatory bodies having jurisdiction in the countries or localities where we manufacture products, where our OMPULs are established or where we plan to supply products. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning research and development, testing, manufacturing processes, equipment and facilities, including compliance with GMPs, labeling and distribution, import and export, facility registration or licensing, and product registration and listing. As a result, our facilities are subject to regulation in Israel and South Korea. We are also required to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, as discussed below. These regulatory requirements impact many aspects of our operations, including manufacturing, developing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, import and export and record keeping related to customers’ products. Noncompliance with any applicable regulatory requirements can result in government refusal to approve facilities for manufacturing products or products for commercialization.
 
Both of our products and our customers’ products must undergo pre-clinical and clinical evaluations relating to product safety and efficacy before they are approved as commercial therapeutic products. The regulatory authorities that have jurisdiction in the countries in which our and our customers’ products are intended to be marketed may delay or put on hold clinical trials, delay approval of a product or determine that the product is not approvable. The regulatory agencies can delay approval of a drug if our manufacturing facilities or OMPULs are not able to demonstrate compliance with cGTPs, pass other aspects of pre-approval inspections (i.e., compliance with filed submissions) or properly scale up to produce commercial supplies. The government authorities having jurisdiction in the countries in which our customers intend to market their products have the authority to withdraw product approval or suspend manufacture if there are significant problems with raw materials or supplies, quality control and assurance or the product is deemed adulterated or misbranded. In addition, if new legislation or regulations are enacted or existing legislation or regulations are amended or are interpreted or enforced differently, we may be required to obtain additional approvals or operate according to different manufacturing or operating standards or pay additional fees. This may require a change in our manufacturing techniques or additional capital investments in our facilities.

Certain products manufactured by us involve the use, storage and transportation of toxic and hazardous materials. Our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment and the maintenance of safe working conditions. We maintain environmental and industrial safety and health compliance programs and training at our facilities.
 
Prevailing legislation tends to hold companies primarily responsible for the proper disposal of their waste even after transfer to third party waste disposal facilities. Other future developments, such as increasingly strict environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and enforcement policies, could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us and could subject the handling, manufacture, use, reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants at our facilities to more rigorous scrutiny than at present.
 
Our development operations involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals. Although we believe that our procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards, we may incur significant additional costs to comply with applicable laws in the future. Also, even if we are in compliance with applicable laws, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials or chemicals. As a result of any such contamination or injury, we may incur liability or local, city, state or federal authorities may curtail the use of these materials and interrupt our business operations. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines, and the liability could exceed our resources. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our contract manufacturing operations, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
The costs associated with complying with the various applicable local, state, national and international regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with such legal requirements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Development and Regulatory Approval of Our Therapies and Product Candidates — Extensive industry regulation has had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our business, especially our product development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities.” for additional discussion of the costs associated with complying with the various regulations.
 
POCare Therapies Portfolio
 
Our therapeutic product portfolio pipeline is diverse and addresses various unmet clinical needs. It is predominantly comprised of personalized autologous cell therapies, implying that patients receive cells that originate from their own body, virtually eliminating the risk of an immune response and rejection and thus easing various regulatory hurdles. In addition, by leveraging our vast experience and proven track record in developing and optimizing cell processing, these selective therapies are adapted to be produced in closed, automated systems, reducing the need for high grade cleanroom environments. The systems enable each stage of the manufacturing process (cell sorting, expansion, genetic modifications, quality control) to be optimized in order to substantially reduce the cost burden for patients and making the therapies widely accessible. Notably, our therapeutic pipeline is developed by researchers from our network and are subsequently out-licensed and validated in multi-center clinical trials conducted across point of care partner sites leveraging the robustness of our POCare Network. Once approved these therapies are distributed to leading medical institutions globally within our network and thus granting the inventors a royalty-based commercialization horizon.
Regulatory Process in the United States
 
Our potential product candidates are subject to regulation as a biological product under the Public Health Service Act and the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The FDA generally requires the following steps for pre-market approval or licensure of a new biological product:

● | Pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, requirements to assess a drug’s biological activity and to identify potential safety problems, and to characterize and document the product’s chemistry, manufacturing controls, formulation, and stability; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


21
--


● | Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before clinical testing in humans can start; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Obtaining approval of Institutional Review Boards, or IRBs, of research institutions or other clinical sites to introduce biologic drug candidates into humans in clinical trials; 
● | Conducting adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its intended indication conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements; 
● | Compliance with current GMP regulations and standards; 
● | Submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for marketing that includes adequate results of pre-clinical testing and clinical trials; 
● | The FDA reviews the marketing application in order to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe, effective and potent for its intended uses; and 
● | Obtaining FDA approval of the BLA, including inspection and approval of the product manufacturing facility as compliant with GMP requirements, prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the pharmaceutical agent. The FDA may also require post marketing testing and surveillance of approved products or place other conditions on the approvals. 

Regulatory Process in Europe
 
In the European Union (“EU”) somatic cell and gene therapy products are called Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product (ATMPs). Since January 2022 the Clinical Trial Regulation (EU) 536/2014 regulates the application of medicinal products including ATMPs to humans immediately effective in all member states. In conjunction with Regulation 536/2014 the EU commission has released two delegated acts regulating manufacturing of investigational as well as marketed AMPs. For products that are regulated as an ATMP,
 Regulation requires:
 

● | Compliance with current GMP regulations and standards, as described in the delegated acts; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Filing a Clinical Trial Application (“CTA”); 
● | in EU member states and EEA countries according to regulation 536/2014 via CTIS (Clinical Trial Information System) allowing a harmonized approval process among all member states (including multinational clinical trials); 
● | Obtaining approval by ethic committees responsible for medical institutions; 
● | Adequate and well-controlled clinical trials according to GCP standards protecting the well-being of a study participant and establishing the safety and efficacy of the product for its intended use; 
● | Centralized submission procedure for ATMPs via EMA for Marketing Authorization; and 
● | Review and approval of the Marketing Authorization Application. 

 
As in the U.S., prior to the general regulatory process of a new biologic products, we will prosecute an Orphan Drug Designation for treatment of patients with established “Diabetes Mellitus” induced by total pancreatectomy. In the EU, in order to be qualified, the prevalence must be below 5 per 10,000 of the EU population, except where the expected return on investment is insufficient to justify the investment.
 
Authorized orphan medicines benefit from 10 years of protection from market competition with similar medicines with similar indications once they are approved. Companies applying for designated orphan medicines pay reduced fees for regulatory activities. This includes reduced fees for protocol assistance, marketing-authorization applications, inspections before authorization, applications for changes to marketing authorizations made after approval, and reduced annual fees.
 
Exemption from the centralized procedure was introduced into the ATMP Regulation to allow marketing of certain ATMPs in individual EU member states. The so-called “hospital exemption” can only be applied for custom-made ATMPs used in a hospital setting for a specific patient by a treating physician. In addition, a competent authority must authorize hospital exemption for ATMPs. Hospital exemption products must comply with the same national requirements concerning quality, traceability and pharmacovigilance that apply to authorized medicinal products. The “hospital exemption” has to be applied for individually in each EU member state according to national procedures and control measures.

Clinical Trials
 
Typically, both in the U.S. and the EU, clinical testing involves a three-phase process, although the phases may overlap. In Phase I, clinical trials are conducted with a small number of healthy volunteers or patients and are designed to provide information about product safety and to evaluate the pattern of drug distribution and metabolism within the body. In Phase II, clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. In some cases, an initial trial is conducted in diseased patients to assess both preliminary efficacy and preliminary safety and patterns of drug metabolism and distribution, in which case it is referred to as a Phase I/II trial. Phase III clinical trials are generally large-scale, multi-center, comparative trials conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide statistically valid proof of efficacy, as well as safety and potency. In some circumstances, the FDA or EMA may require Phase IV or post-marketing trials if it feels that additional information needs to be collected about the drug after it is on the market. During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, as well as clinical trial investigators. An agency may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the testing based upon the data that have been accumulated to that point and its assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patient. Monitoring all aspects of the study to minimize risks is a continuing process. All adverse events must be reported to the FDA or EMA.
 
The FDA has granted Orphan Drug designation for our AIP cells as a cell replacement therapy for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia-prone diabetes resulting from TP due to chronic pancreatitis. The FDA’s Orphan Drug Designation Program provides orphan status to drugs and biologics which are defined as those intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases/disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Orphan designation qualifies the sponsor of the drug for various development incentives, including eligibility for seven years of market exclusivity upon regulatory approval, exemption from FDA application fees, tax credits for qualified clinical trials, and other potential assistance in the drug development process.
 
Human Capital Resources
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had an aggregate of 167 employees working at our company and Subsidiaries. In addition, we retain the services of outside consultants for various functions including clinical work, finance, accounting and business development services. Most of our senior management and professional employees have had prior experience in pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
Compensation and Benefits
 
We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. Biotechnology companies both large and small compete for a limited number of qualified applicants to fill specialized positions. To attract qualified applicants, we offer a total rewards package consisting of base salary and cash target bonus, a comprehensive benefit package and equity compensation to select employees. Bonus opportunity and equity compensation increase as a percentage of total compensation based on level of responsibility. Actual bonus payout is based on performance.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 
Much of our success is rooted in the diversity of our teams and our commitment to inclusion. We value diversity at all levels. We believe that our business benefits from the different perspectives a diverse workforce brings, and we pride ourselves on having a strong, inclusive and positive culture based on our shared mission and values. This is reflected in our numbers with our total workforce being approximately 53% women, 11% ethnically diverse and 50% over the age of 40.

Health, Wellness and Safety
 
We believe that the safety and health of our employees and their families is essential to our business. Our culture is driven by a desire to do what is right, and we strive to support the well-being of our employees. We prioritize the safety and well-being of our employees as they face both mental and physical challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our employees have demonstrated great resilience during the pandemic, and we continue to provide resources to support their well-being. Beginning in March 2020, we have supported our employees and government efforts to curb the COVID-19 pandemic through a multi-faceted communication, infrastructure, and behavior modification and enforcement effort that includes:

● | establishing clear and regular COVID-19 policies, safety protocols, and updates to all employees; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | strongly encouraging all office-based employees to work from home; and 
● | implementing protocols to address actual and suspected COVID-19 cases and potential exposure. 

 
Our financial, medical, and mental health benefits that were already in place prior to the COVID-19 pandemic were designed to help employees through crisis, and we further expanded our offerings to create appropriate “work from home” conditions for success and wellness, including purchasing additional IT equipment and office supplies and increasing communications related to our mental health benefits. In particular, we offered sessions on mindfulness to further support the mental health of our employees.
 
Environmental, Social and Governance
 
Our commitment to integrating sustainability across our organization begins with our Board of Directors, or the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board has oversight of strategy and risk management related to Environmental, Social and Governance, or ESG. All employees are responsible for upholding our core values, including to communicate, collaborate, innovate and be respectful, as well as for adhering to our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, including our policies on bribery, corruption, conflicts of interest and our whistleblower program. We encourage employees to come to us with observations and complaints, ensuring we understand the severity and frequency of an event in order to escalate and assess accordingly. Our Chief Compliance Officer strives to ensure accountability, objectivity, and compliance with our Code of Conduct. If a complaint is financial in nature, the Audit Committee Chair is notified concurrently, which triggers an investigation, action, and report.
 
We are committed to protecting the environment and attempt to mitigate any negative impact of our operations. We monitor resource use, improve efficiency, and at the same time, reduce our emissions and waste. We are systematically addressing the environmental impacts of the buildings we rent as we make improvements, including adding energy control systems and other energy efficiency measures. Waste in our own operation is minimized by our commitment to reduce both single-use plastics and operating paper-free, primarily in a digital environment. We have safety protocols in place for handling biohazardous waste in our labs, and we use third-party vendors for biohazardous waste and chemical disposal.
