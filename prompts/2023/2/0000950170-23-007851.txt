Markets and Applications
 Since our inception, we have focused on satisfying the needs of our customers by establishing long-term collaborative relationships. We have a diverse base of customers across our primary served markets, which include semiconductor, electronics and packaging, and specialty industrial.
We have developed the following two product strategies that have been instrumental in delivering value to our customers and helping them solve their most complex problems:
 •Our Surround the WaferSM offering includes a wide range of products, design and development services, system level integration, training programs, calibration, service, and repair for our semiconductor customers. This unique combination of products and services enables our customers to solve the challenges of ultra-thin layers, new materials and complex 3D structures while maintaining quality and productivity levels. We have cultivated this strategy over the past two decades by adding critical enabling technologies to our portfolio. The Surround the Wafer offering is an update from what we previously referred to as Surround the Chamber®, given our broadened exposure in photonics solutions for lithography, metrology and inspection, which extends beyond just the vacuum chamber. 
 •Our Surround the Workpiece® offering includes product design and development, system level integration, research and development, system, subsystem and component selection, and maintenance, repair and calibration services in the field of laser-based guidance and control for manufacturing processes. With the recent acquisition of Atotech, we have introduced an extension of the Surround the Workpiece offering called Optimize the InterconnectSM , which refers to MKS’ combined laser drilling and chemistry solutions geared towards accelerating innovation and customers’ time-to-market in printed circuit board (“PCB”) and package substrate manufacturing.
 At our core, MKS is a foundational enabler of miniaturization and complexity. We believe there are three secular trends benefitting MKS. First is the impact of a world that continues to be increasingly interconnected, driving the need for smaller, more powerful and feature-rich advanced electronic devices, which is enabled by semiconductor manufacturing, laser processing and chemistry solutions. Second is the increasing complexity of technology transitions in semiconductor, PCB and package substrate manufacturing, which leads to inflections, such as extreme vertical structures and process engineering at the atomic level, as well as increased interconnect density and smaller features. These inflections provide additional growth opportunities for MKS, as we believe we are uniquely positioned to deliver the broadest and deepest portfolio of solutions. Third is the accelerating need for laser-based precision manufacturing techniques, which are enabled by lasers, photonics, optics, precision motion control, vibration control and systems solutions.
 We believe our long history and deep expertise in solving critical problems position us well to address these challenges for our customers.
 Semiconductor Market
MKS is a critical solutions provider for semiconductor manufacturing. Our products are used in major semiconductor processing steps, such as depositing thin films of material onto silicon wafer substrates, etching, cleaning, lithography, metrology, and inspection. The semiconductor industry continually faces new challenges, as products become smaller, more powerful and highly mobile. Ultra-thin layers, smaller critical dimensions, new materials, 3D structures, and the ongoing need for higher yield and productivity drive the need for tighter process measurement and control, all of which MKS supports. We believe we are the broadest critical subsystem provider in the wafer fabrication equipment ecosystem and address over 85% of the market. We have characterized our broad and unique offering as Surround the Wafer to reflect the technology enablement we provide across almost every major process in semiconductor manufacturing today.
 The semiconductor market is subject to rapid demand shifts, which are difficult to predict. We cannot be certain as to the timing or extent of future demand or any future weakness in the semiconductor capital equipment industry. For example, our semiconductor market revenue sequentially increased 12% in 2022, 32% in 2021, and 49% in 2020. We anticipate that our semiconductor revenue could decrease in 2023, as a result of expected softening in the semiconductor market following three years of significant growth, due, in part, to new U.S. government regulations, as further described under Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Segments and Markets—Semiconductor Market.”
 Approximately 58%, 62%, and 59% of our net revenues for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, were from sales to our semiconductor market. Following the Atotech Acquisition, MKS’ end-market exposure has become more diversified and in the fourth quarter of 2022, revenue from the semiconductor market was 46% of total net revenues.


Electronics and Packaging Market
MKS is a foundational solutions provider for the electronics and packaging market. Our portfolio includes photonics components, laser drilling systems, electronics chemistries and plating equipment, that are critical for the manufacturing of PCBs and package substrates, as well as in wafer level packaging (“WLP”) applications. Similar to the semiconductor industry, the PCB, package substrate and WLP industries demand smaller features, greater density, and better performance. In addition, the electronics and packaging market also includes sales of our vacuum and photonics solutions for display manufacturing applications. We characterize our complementary offering of laser systems and chemistry solutions as Optimize the InterconnectSM, to reflect the unique technology enablement we provide at the interconnect level within PCBs, package substrates and WLPs.
Approximately 15%, 12%, and 11% of our net revenues for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, were from sales to our electronics and packaging market.
 Specialty Industrial Market
 MKS’ strategy in specialty industrial is to leverage our domain expertise and proprietary technologies across a broad array of applications in industrial technologies, life and health sciences, and research and defense markets.
Industrial Technologies
 Industrial technologies encompasses a wide range of diverse applications, including chemistries for functional coatings, surface finishing and wear resistance in the automobile industry, vacuum solutions for synthetic diamond manufacturing and photonics for solar manufacturing.

Approximately 27%, 26%, and 29% of our net revenues for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, were from sales to our specialty industrial market.
 International Markets
 A significant portion of our net revenues is from sales to customers in international markets. For 2022, 2021, and 2020, international net revenues accounted for approximately 58%, 57% and 55%, respectively, of our total net revenues. A significant portion of our international net revenues were from sales to customers in China, Germany and South Korea. We expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of total net revenues for the foreseeable future. Long-lived assets located outside of the United States accounted for approximately 57% and 28% of our total long-lived assets in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in long-lived assets outside of the United States primarily related to the Atotech Acquisition. Long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment, net, right-of-use assets, and certain other assets and exclude goodwill, intangible assets and long-term tax-related accounts.
Reportable Segments, and Product and Service Offerings
 In the first quarter of 2022, we updated the names of our then-three divisions in order to simplify our naming convention. These three divisions, formerly known as the Vacuum & Analysis Division, the Light & Motion Division and the Equipment & Solutions Division, were renamed the Vacuum Solutions Division (“VSD”), the Photonics Solutions Division (“PSD”) and the Equipment Solutions Division (“ESD”), respectively. Following the Atotech Acquisition, we refer to the Atotech business as the Materials Solutions Division (“MSD”). During the third quarter of 2022, we consolidated our equipment solutions business (“ESB”), previously ESD, into a component of PSD. We group our product offerings by our reportable segments: VSD, PSD and MSD. Global Service represents our service offerings and consists of total services for all three of our reportable segments.

Our manufacturing facilities are located in Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Czech Republic, France, Germany, India, Israel, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Romania, Singapore, South Korea and the United States. In addition, we rely on significant subcontracted operations in Mexico and selected contract manufacturers in Asia. Our business depends on the timely supply of products and services that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of our customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, components and subassemblies from suppliers, including contract manufacturers. We purchase a wide range of electronic, optical, mechanical and electrical components, some of which are designed to our specifications. We consider our lean manufacturing techniques and responsiveness to customers’ significantly fluctuating product demands to be a competitive advantage.
 Backlog
 We generally schedule production of our products based upon our customers’ delivery requirements. Lead times for many of our products are very short, as a large portion of our orders are received and shipped within 90 days. Some of the plating equipment manufactured by MSD has longer lead times of up to 12 months. In many cases, orders may be subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer with limited or no penalty. Our backlog at any particular date, therefore, is not necessarily indicative of actual sales which may be generated for any succeeding period. Historically, our backlog levels have fluctuated based upon the ordering patterns of our customers and changes in our manufacturing capacity. Order patterns exiting 2022 reflected a softening demand for semiconductor capital equipment anticipated for 2023.
Competition
 The market for our products is cyclical and highly competitive. Principal competitive factors include product quality, performance and price, historical customer relationships, breadth of product line, ease of use, manufacturing capabilities and responsiveness, and customer service and support. Although we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors, we can make no assurances that we will continue to do so.

In addition, we provide financial support for college and graduate education for U.S. employees and access to online learning for all employees in local languages to help further the careers of our entire workforce.
Employee Engagement
 MKS is committed to meaningful engagement with its employees. In 2022, we engaged a firm that specializes in corporate culture to conduct a global survey on company culture, in order to understand the values, beliefs and behaviors that shape our organization. The results of the survey are expected to inform how we manage our business and build relationships.
 In addition, in 2022, MKS conducted its second annual global employee engagement survey, which, due to the timing of the closing of the Atotech Acquisition, did not include Atotech employees. The results of the survey were thoroughly assessed and shared with our Chief Executive Officer and executive leadership team as well as our Board of Directors. In 2023, we plan to include all employees in the global employee engagement survey, using the feedback we receive to examine current practices and drive new initiatives.
 Our executive management team also conducts regular calls with employees around the world to ensure they are connected to the progress of the Company.
