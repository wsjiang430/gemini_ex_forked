Item 1. Business.
 
(a) Introduction   

United-Guardian, Inc. (“Registrant” or “Company”) is a Delaware corporation that, through its Guardian Laboratories division, manufactures and markets cosmetic ingredients, pharmaceuticals, medical lubricants, and specialty industrial products. We also conduct research and product development, primarily related to the development of new and unique cosmetic ingredients. Our research and development department also modifies, refines, and expands the uses for existing products, with the goal of further developing the market for our products. The Company also develops new products using natural and environmentally friendly raw materials, which is a priority to many of the Company’s cosmetic customers.
 
Our predecessor entity, United International Research, Inc. ("UIR"), was founded and incorporated in New York in 1942 by Dr. Alfred R. Globus, the Company's Chairman and Director of Research until his death on April 9, 2009. On February 10, 1982, a merger took place between UIR and Guardian Chemical Corporation ("Guardian"), an affiliate of UIR, whereby Guardian was merged into UIR and the name was changed to United-Guardian, Inc., a New York corporation. On September 14, 1987, United-Guardian, Inc. (New York) was merged with and into a newly formed Delaware corporation by the same name, United-Guardian, Inc., for the purpose of changing the domicile to the State of Delaware.
 
The cornerstone of our business is our product innovation. We use our product development and formulation expertise to maintain our market position and to propel future growth. We also focus on the development of new products that fill unmet market needs and have unique properties.
 
Our products are sold into stable and growing markets such as personal care, medical lubricants and pharmaceutical products. Our current product offerings include cosmetic ingredients, medical lubricants, pharmaceuticals and specialty industrial products. In the second quarter of 2023, we plan to discontinue the manufacturing and sale of our specialty industrial products. The decision to discontinue this product line was made based on the fact that these products represented less than 2% of our gross sales over the past several years, and the small production scale
 
Our product offerings are segregated into the following categories:
 

● | Cosmetic Ingredients: Cosmetic ingredients is an extensive line of multifactional water-based gel formulations designed to mainly offer sensory enhancement, lubrication, texture and moisturization to personal care products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Medical Lubricants: Medical lubricants include a line of water-based gel formulations designed to mainly offer sensory enhancement and lubrication to medical products. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pharmaceutical Products: Pharmaceutical products include an FDA approved prescription drug that is used primarily to prevent and to dissolve calcifications in urethral catheters, as well as a chlorine-based topical antimicrobial.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Industrial Products: Industrial products include cleaning solutions used in various industrial applications. As discussed above, we plan to discontinue the manufacturing and sale of these products beginning in the second quarter of 2023.

(b) Description of Business
 
We manufacture and market cosmetic ingredients, pharmaceuticals, medical lubricants, and specialty industrial products. We also conduct research and development, primarily related to the development of new and unique cosmetic ingredients. We focus on the development of products that fill unmet market needs, have unique properties, and use proprietary technology that we typically protect as trade secrets rather than with patents. Many of our products are marketed through collaborative agreements with larger companies.
 
The cosmetic ingredients manufactured by us are marketed to end users through our worldwide network of distributors and are currently used by many of the major manufacturers of cosmetic products. We ship our cosmetic ingredients to our distributors Ex Works (“EXW”) from our facility in Hauppauge, New York. Those distributors in turn resell those products to their customers, who are typically the manufacturers and marketers of cosmetic and personal care products. The cosmetic ingredients are not sold on a consignment basis, so unless a product is determined to be defective, it is not returnable, except at the discretion of the Company.
 
Our pharmaceutical products are sold primarily to several full-line drug wholesalers which in turn supply those products to pharmacies, physicians, and hospitals. We arrange for, and cover the cost of, shipping our pharmaceutical products, and sales of those products are final when shipped. They are returnable only under specific circumstances in accordance with pharmaceutical industry standards, such as if the products are (a) damaged when received; (b) defective; (c) too close to their expiration dates to sell; or (d) within a year after their expiration dates.
 
We operate in one business segment. Our products are separated into four distinct product categories: cosmetic ingredients, pharmaceuticals, medical lubricants, and industrial products. Each product category is marketed differently.  
 
Our cosmetic ingredients are currently marketed globally by five distributors, of which Ashland Specialty Ingredients (“ASI”), a business segment of Ashland, Inc., is the largest. ASI manufactures and markets globally an extensive line of personal care and pharmaceutical additives and various other specialty products. We sell our cosmetic ingredients directly to those distributors, which in turn resell those products to their customers for use in the formulation of one or more of the customers’ personal care and cosmetic products. Our non-pharmaceutical medical lubricants (referred to hereinafter as the Company’s “medical lubricants”) and our specialty industrial products are sold directly to marketers of finished products or to the contract manufacturers utilized by those marketers. We market our pharmaceutical products primarily through our dedicated Renacidin® website. The pharmaceutical products are sold to hospitals and pharmacies primarily through full-line drug wholesalers, which purchase our products outright for resale to their customers. We also sell a small quantity of pharmaceutical products directly to hospitals and pharmacies. Our products are sold under trademarks or trade names owned by the Company, some of which are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office as well as with comparable regulatory agencies in some foreign countries. We maintain a corporate website at www.u-g.com, and a specific website for Renacidin at www.renacidin.com.
 
All references in this Annual Report to “sales” or “Sales” shall mean “net sales” unless specifically identified as “gross sales.”
 
PRODUCTS 
 
As stated above, we operate in one business segment, and our product lines are separated into four distinct categories:

UNITED-GUARDIAN, INC.
 
COSMETIC INGREDIENTS 
 
The cosmetic ingredients we manufacture are marketed and sold to the end users through our worldwide network of distributors. Our cosmetic ingredients are currently sold globally by five distributors, of which Ashland Specialty Ingredients (“ASI”), a business segment of Ashland, Inc., is the largest. ASI is the exclusive distributor of our products in the United States, Canada, Asia, South & Central America, Mexico, Europe (all regions other than France, the United Kingdom, Italy & Switzerland), Scandinavia, Africa, Australia, the Middle East and Korea.
 
Our other distributors are: Azelis UK Ltd in the United Kingdom, Sederma SAS, a subsidiary of Croda International Plc. in France, Safic-Alcan S.p.A. in Italy, and Azelis Cosmetics GmbH in Switzerland.
 
We ship our cosmetic ingredients to our distributors EXW from our facility in Hauppauge, New York. The distributors resell the products to their customers, who are typically major manufacturers and marketers of cosmetic and personal care products. They utilize our products in their finished products. The cosmetic ingredients are not sold on a consignment basis, so unless a product is determined to be defective, it is not returnable, except at our discretion.
 
We believe that in the event ASI were to cease marketing and selling our products, alternative distribution agreements could be signed with other global distributors of cosmetic ingredients. These new appointed distributors would continue supplying products to customers currently using our products, without any significant interruption of sales. We also believe that if we choose to replace one or more of our current distributors, we would be able to put in place new distribution agreements to service our customers in all the geographic areas affected. If necessary, we would also be able to sell directly to the end users of our products until a new distribution arrangement was put in place.
 
PRODUCTS - COSMETIC INGREDIENTS:
 
LUBRAJEL® is an extensive line of multifunctional water-based gel formulations designed to mainly provide sensory enhancement, lubrication, and texture to personal care products. Some of the Lubrajel products also offer skin moisturization benefits. Many of the Lubrajel products are biodegradable. The Lubrajel products are primarily used in skin care products such as moisturizers, anti-aging creams, body lotions, face serums, spa products and sunscreens. The Lubrajel products are also used in makeup products such as primers and foundations. Each Lubrajel product offers unique benefits for the formulation of skin care and color cosmetic products. The basic product line includes Lubrajel CG, Lubrajel DV, Lubrajel IIXD, Lubrajel MS, Lubrajel NP and Lubrajel Oil.
 
To address customer demand for preservative-free products, we developed and launched Lubrajel DV PF, Lubrajel IIXD PF, Lubrajel MS PF, Lubrajel Oil PF and Lubrajel PF. To address customer demand for phenoxyethanol-free products, we developed and launched Lubrajel DV free, Lubrajel IIXD free, Lubrajel MS free, Lubrajel NP Free and Lubrajel Oil free.
 
In the last few years, to meet the growing consumer demand for “green” and sustainable products, we have focused on developing and launching new products which only contain ingredients that are considered “natural”. The Lubrajel products in the new natural line have been certified by the Cosmetic Organic and Natural Standard (“COSMOS”). This standard is recognized globally by the cosmetic industry.
 
LUBRAJEL NATURAL was the first product that was launched using only ingredients that are considered natural. This is a unique formulation of natural polymers and glycerin. Lubrajel Natural imparts a light and velvety skin feel, improving the sensory characteristics of personal care formulations, while providing a powerful skin moisturizing effect.
LUBRAJEL MARINE™ was the second product that we developed for our new line of natural products. It was formulated using naturally derived polymers, with some of the ingredients sourced from marine vegetation. This product was developed jointly with ASI, and for that reason is being sold globally on an exclusive basis by ASI.

UNITED-GUARDIAN, INC.
 
Other products in the Lubrajel Natural line of Lubrajel products are:
 
LUBRAJEL OlL NATURAL was developed as a ”green”, low viscosity alternative. Lubrajel Oil Natural is a unique formulation of the natural film former pullulan, cellulose gum, xanthan gum and glycerin. It imparts a silky, silicone-like skin feel and a long playtime as well as moisturization. Lubrajel Oil Natural makes possible the creation of smooth, luxuriant textures without adding viscosity. Since it also has good clarity, it is an excellent choice for clear formulations.
LUBRAJEL TERRA is a multifunctional, moisturizing hydrogel with unique aesthetic qualities for natural formulations. Lubrajel Terra’s synthetic-like texture can be attributed to the novel complex of polysaccharides, Konjac Mannan, derived from the Asian plant, Amorphophallus Konjac, also known as Devil’s Tongue, and Galactoarabinan, derived from the Larch tree, which are acclaimed for their outstanding moisture retaining and film forming properties, as well as cellulose gum.
 
In addition to the Lubrajel line of products, we also manufacture other cosmetic ingredients noted below: which accounted fortless than 10% of total sales in 2022:
 
B-122™ is a powdered lubricant used in the manufacture of certain cosmetics, such as pressed powders, eyeliners, and rouges, as well as some industrial products. The product acts as a binder, increases water-repellency and drop strength, and lowers the coefficient of friction in the products in which it is used.
 
ORCHID COMPLEX™ is an oil-based extract of fresh orchids. It is characterized by its excellent lubricity, spreadability, light feel, and emolliency. Because of its alcohol solubility it may also be used in fragrance products, such as perfumes and toiletries. Its emolliency makes it an excellent additive to shampoos, bath products and facial cleansers.
LUBRASIL™ II SB is a special formulation of Lubrajel in which silicone oil is incorporated into a Lubrajel base using proprietary technology that enables the product to maintain much of the clarity of regular Lubrajel. The product has a silky feel and is water resistant while at the same time providing moisturization.
 
Sales of our cosmetic ingredients represented approximately 41% of total our total sales for the year ended December 31, 2022.
 
We believe that there is potential to continue growing the sales of our cosmetic ingredients through new product development, development of new product applications, development of additional claim substantiations, and geographic expansion. Although we have experienced significant pricing pressure from low-cost competitors, we believe that we can compete with these low-cost competitors because our customers value our innovation capabilities, the quality of our products, the reliability of supply and the outstanding technical support.
 
MEDICAL LUBRICANTS 
 
Our medical lubricants are sold directly to manufacturers and marketers of finished products or to the contract manufacturers utilized by those companies. Sales of our medical lubricants are shipped EXW from our facility in Hauppauge, New York. Sales are deemed final upon shipment, and we have no obligation to repurchase or allow the return of these goods unless they are defective.
PRODUCTS – MEDICAL LUBRICANTS
 
Our medical lubricants are also sold under the Lubrajel brand since they are water-based gel formulations designed to mainly provide sensory enhancement and lubrication to medical products. The Lubrajel medical lubricant products are primarily used in catheters, condoms, personal lubricants and in oral care applications such as mouth washes.
 
    6 

  

UNITED-GUARDIAN, INC.
 
Currently, we offer six medical lubricant products for catheter lubrication, one product for the lubrication of condoms and one product for oral care. In addition, we develop and sell customized exclusive products for all these applications.
 
Our medical lubricants include the following:
 
LUBRAJEL MG was the first medical lubricant product developed by the Company. It has been used by many medical device manufacturers for lubricating urinary catheters, pre-lubricated enema tips, and other medical devices.
LUBRAJEL MGL is a medical lubricant with a lower viscosity than our standard medical lubricant, Lubrajel MG. It can be used as a general and instrument lubricant for use during physical exams. It can be applied to catheters, thermometers and other instruments to ensure ease of use and patient comfort.
LUBRAJEL RR and RC are both water-based gels used primarily as lubricants for urinary catheters. Lubrajel RR and Lubrajel RC can withstand sterilization by gamma radiation, which is one of the methods of terminally sterilizing medical and hospital products. Lubrajel RR was the first radiation resistant Lubrajel product. Lubrajel RC was developed as a lower-cost alternative to Lubrajel RR for those customers who are in more cost-sensitive markets.
 
LUBRAJEL FLUID is a water-based condom lubricant designed as an alternative to traditional silicone-based lubricants. The water-based formula cleans up easily with soap and water and does not stain clothing. The lubrication system employed in Lubrajel Fluid is specifically designed to be compatible with traditional condom release powders, which are used during the manufacture of latex condoms.

LUBRAJEL LC, LUBRAJEL BA and LUBRAJEL FA are Lubrajel formulations that were developed for use in oral care applications.
 
Sales of medical lubricants represented approximately 19% of our total sales for the year ended December 31, 2022.
 
We believe that there is potential to continue growing the sales of our medical lubricants through new product development, development of new product applications, and geographic expansion.
PHARMACEUTICALS
 
We sell our pharmaceutical products primarily to full-line drug wholesalers, which in turn supply those products to pharmacies, physicians, hospitals, long-term care facilities, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and other government agencies. We also sell a small quantity of pharmaceutical products directly to hospitals and pharmacies. We arrange for, and cover the cost of, shipping our pharmaceutical products, and sales of those products are final when shipped. The pharmaceutical products are returnable only under specific circumstances in accordance with pharmaceutical industry standards, such as if the products are (a) damaged when received; (b) defective; (c) too close to their expiration dates to sell; or (d) within a year after their expiration dates. These return policies are in conformance with standard pharmaceutical industry practice.
PRODUCTS - PHARMACEUTICALS
 
RENACIDIN is a prescription drug approved by the FDA that is used primarily to prevent and to dissolve calcifications in urethral catheters. We maintain a specific website dedicated to this product at www.renacidin.com.
 
    7 

  

UNITED-GUARDIAN, INC.
 
CLORPACTIN® WCS-90 is a chlorine-based drug that is marketed as a topical antimicrobial and is also used in urology. It is also a powerful disinfectant, fungicide, and deodorizer.
 
Our pharmaceutical products represented 39% of our total sales for the year ended December 31, 2022.
 
We believe that there is potential to grow the sales of our pharmaceutical products through geographic expansion.
 
INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS 
 
DESELEX™ is a sequestering and chelating agent that is used primarily as a replacement for phosphates in the manufacture of detergents. It also has some use in personal care products as a chelating agent in shampoos and body washes. In March 2022, we discontinued this product due to minimal sales and a significant increase in raw material costs.
THOROCLENS is a chlorine-based industrial cleanser which we manufacture and package for a small company in New England. Beginning in the second quarter of 2023, we will discontinue the manufacturing and sale of this product.
FOREIGN SALES
 
For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 25% and 20%, respectively, of our sales revenue was from foreign sources, and was derived from (a) sales of our cosmetic ingredients to foreign distributors, which accounted for approximately 9% of sales in both 2022 and 2021, and (b) sales of medical lubricants directly to certain customers in foreign countries, which accounted for approximately 16% and 11% of our sales revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
 
Because all shipments to our largest distributor, ASI, are delivered to ASI’s warehouses in the U.S., all sales to ASI are considered domestic sales, even though a significant percentage of ASI’s sales of our products are to customers in foreign countries. Based on sales information provided by ASI, 66% of ASI’s sales of our products in 2022 were to customers in foreign countries, compared with 74% in 2021. ASI’s largest foreign market in both 2022 and 2021 was China, which accounted for approximately 38% of ASI’s sales of our products in 2022 and 42% in 2021.
 
Since sales of our products are denominated in U.S. Dollars, our selling prices are generally not affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, except to the extent that a stronger dollar compared with foreign currencies can make our products less competitive in foreign markets, sometimes requiring adjustments to our prices in order to be more competitive. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar in 2022, which reached its highest level in 20 years, made our products less competitive and they became pricier in other countries. We continue to work closely with our network of distributors to price our products as competitively as possible and, when appropriate, to offer additional volume discounts and more aggressive pricing to maintain and increase sales and expand our customer base.
 
DOMESTIC SALES
 
For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 75% and 80%, respectively, of our sales were from domestic sources.
 
COSMETIC INGREDIENTS:
 
In the United States, our cosmetic ingredient products are marketed and distributed exclusively by ASI in accordance with a marketing agreement entered into in 1996 with its predecessor company, International Specialty Products (“ISP”). That agreement was for the marketing of the Company’s cosmetic ingredients in North, Central, and South America. Since that time, this initial agreement has been modified and expanded multiple times (see “Marketing Agreements” below), most recently in 2019 when Korea was added to ASI’s marketing territory. ASI also has the exclusive right to market four of the Company’s products globally: Lubrajel Marine, which was the second product in our Lubrajel Natural line of products; Lubrajel BA, an oral care product which was specifically developed for ASI in 2012; and two of our preservative-free products, Lubrajel Oil PF and Lubrajel II XD PF. The current agreement with ASI automatically renewed on January 1, 2022 and will automatically renew again on January 1, 2024 unless either party chooses to terminate, which can be done by giving 60 days’ notice prior to the then expiration date.
 
    8 

  

UNITED-GUARDIAN, INC.
 
Domestic sales of cosmetic ingredients accounted for approximately 32% of total sales in 2022, compared with 41% in 2021. Sales to our largest distributor, ASI, accounted for approximately 32% of total sales in 2022 and 42% of sales in 2021.
PHARMACEUTICALS:
 
Our pharmaceutical products are marketed only in the United States and are sold primarily through full-line drug wholesalers. Sales of those products accounted for approximately 39% of sales in 2022, compared with approximately 34% in 2021.
 
During 2022 and 2021, we participated in various government drug rebate programs related to the sale of Renacidin®, our most important pharmaceutical product. These programs include the Veterans Affairs Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”), and the Medicare Part D Coverage Gap Discount Program (“CGDP”). These programs require us to sell our product at a discounted price, typically given in the form of a rebate. Our sales, as reported, are net of these rebates, some of which are estimated and are recorded in the same period that the revenue is recognized.
 
MEDICAL LUBRICANTS:
 
We sell our medical lubricants directly to end users or to contract manufacturers utilized by the end users. Domestic sales of medical lubricants accounted for approximately 3% of our total sales in 2022, compared with 4% in 2021. Although all shipments of medical lubricants to U.S. locations are considered domestic sales, a percentage of those shipments are subsequently shipped by some customers to foreign manufacturing facilities, which then produce finished products that could be marketed globally.
INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS:
 
Domestic sales of our specialty industrial products accounted for less than 2% of our sales in both 2022 and 2021. These products are sold directly to end-user customers or their contract manufacturers, who incorporate these products into their finished products. We will discontinue manufacturing and distribution of these products in the second quarter of 2023. because sales of these products represent less than 2% of total sales, and the small production scale.
ISO 9001:2015 CERTIFICATION
 
On July 23, 2018, we were certified by DQS Inc. to be in compliance with the latest ISO standard, ISO 9001:2015, indicating that our documented procedures and overall operations had attained the high level of quality needed to comply with this current ISO certification level.
 
Our current ISO 9001:2015 certification is valid through July 22, 2024. We have been in continuous compliance with ISO standards since November 1998. Between November 1998 and December 2003, we were registered under the ISO 9002 standard. From December 2003 to December 2009, we were registered under the ISO 9001:2000 standard. From December 2009 to July 2018, we were registered under the ISO 9001:2008 standard.

UNITED-GUARDIAN, INC.
 
COMPETITION
 
We primarily compete in the specialty ingredients/products space. The participants in this space offer a broad range of product lines designed to meet specific customer needs. Competition is largely based on product performance, price, quality, service, product availability, security of supply, and responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers. Many key competitors are significantly larger than us and have greater financial resources, leading to greater operating and financial flexibility.
 
To improve our competitive position, we are strengthening our core capabilities and investing in product development, especially in naturally derived products. We will also continue providing high-quality products, excellent technical service and continue to be a reliable supplier.
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
In recent years. we have elected to rely on trade secret protection to protect our intellectual property for proprietary product formulations and manufacturing methods. We will file for patent protection in situations where we believe that relying on trade secret protection alone would not provide sufficient protection.
 
We own the Lubrajel®, Renacidin®, and Clorpactin® trademarks.
 
RAW MATERIALS
 
We purchase raw materials from multiple sources in the United States and believe that raw material supplies will be available in quantities sufficient to meet demand in 2023. Although some of those raw materials may be manufactured overseas, all of our suppliers are located within the United States. All of our products were impacted, to varying degrees, by the volatility of raw material costs during 2022, and these conditions are likely to continue in 2023.
 
The principal raw materials we use consist of common industrial organic and inorganic chemicals. We have six major raw material vendors that together accounted for approximately 90% of our raw material purchases in 2022 and 94% in 2021.
 
INVENTORIES, RETURNS, and ALLOWANCES
 
We believe it is important to maintain moderate inventory levels of certain of our finished goods in order to fulfill purchase orders in a timely manner. Historically, sufficient inventory levels, returns, and allowances have not been a significant factor in our business.
BACKLOG
 
We do not currently have any significant backlog of orders.
 
SEASONALITY
 
Due to the nature of our business and the types of products that we market, we are not subject to any significant seasonal fluctuations in sales.
CUSTOMERS
 
Our cosmetic ingredients are currently marketed and sold globally by five distributors. Those distributors, in turn, market and distribute those products to their customers. Although we depend on these distributors for the marketing and distribution of our cosmetic ingredients, we believe that if any of our distributors were to decide not to sell our products, or if we chose to replace one or more of those distributors, we would be able to put new marketing agreements in place to service our customers in all the geographic areas affected. If necessary, we would also be able to sell directly to the end users of our products until such time as a new distributor is put in place.
 
    10 

  

UNITED-GUARDIAN, INC.
 
Our pharmaceutical products are sold to, and distributed by, full-line drug wholesalers throughout the United States. Our medical and specialty industrial products are sold directly by us to the end users of those products or, in some cases, to contract manufacturers used by some of those end users.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 
Our research and development (“R&D”) team’s main focus is to develop new products and product-line extensions. The product development activities are focused on developing products for identified customers and market needs. We frequently collaborate with customers to develop the desired product to meet their specific needs. The R&D team also provides technical support services to assist our customers with application development and co-development. In addition, the R&D team provides ongoing technical assistance and know-how to quality assurance and manufacturing personnel to ensure consistent standards for our products and to deliver environmentally responsible products that exceed customer expectations.
 
Our research and development expenses in 2022 were $490,770 compared with $478,642 in 2021. We expect our research and development expenses in 2023 to be higher than those of 2022 in order to support innovation and growth. Any additional increase in R&D expenses will also depend on whether capital investments are required in order to continue development work on, or to manufacture, any of the new products under development.
 
We require all employees and consultants who may receive confidential and proprietary information to agree in writing to keep such information confidential.
 
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the manufacturing and marketing of many of our products. Some of the products we develop and sell in the United States may require approval from federal regulatory agencies, such as the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”), as well as state regulatory agencies. Some products sold outside the United States may require approval from foreign regulatory agencies.
 
Our operations and many of our products are subject to chemical control laws. These laws include regulation of chemical substances and inventories under and the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (“REACH”) regulation in Europe, Right to Know laws under the Global Harmonized System (“GHS”) for hazard communication, and the regulation of chemicals used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and personal care products and contact food under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act in the United States. We are an FDA Drug Establishment registered site.
 
We are required to comply with all pertinent current Good Manufacturing Practices of the FDA for medical devices and drugs our products may be subject to. Accordingly, the regulations to which we and certain of our products may be subject, and any changes with respect thereto, may materially affect our ability to produce and market new products..
 
Our present and future activities are, and will likely continue to be, subject to varying degrees of additional regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, Environmental Protection Act, import, export and customs regulations, and other present and possible future foreign, federal, state and local regulations.
 
Portions of our operating expenses are directly attributable to complying with federal, state, and local environmental statutes and regulations. In 2022 and 2021, we incurred approximately $39,000 and $32,000, respectively, in federal, state, and local environmental law compliance expenses. There was no material financial or other impact on our results of operations as a result of compliance with environmental laws.
