The Company has recently been in the process of directing major efforts to the practical side of commercial validation.

Recent Developments

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared coronavirus COVID-19 a global pandemic. This contagious disease outbreak, which has continued to spread, and any related adverse public health developments, has adversely affected workforces, economies, and financial markets globally, potentially leading to an economic downturn.
 
As of the date of this filing, the Company has regained a significant portion of its operational capacity and we continue to move forward with our research goals. Our supply of the patented AAGP® molecule has been manufactured and stored in the United States and we have adequate inventory to carry out the projects currently underway. The Company engages contract research organizations (CROs) located in both the United States and Canada. The CROs contracted by the Company for research projects have been able to meet milestone goals without disruption due to the pandemic. In January of 2020, Protokinetix signed a master supply agreement with University of Alberta that clears the way for testing of additional patients in the Phase I clinical trials. The global pandemic halted all work on clinical trials and research testing for most of 2020. Phase I trials were able restart mid-year 2021 but new strains of covid continue to plague the US and Canada. We cannot accurately predict a completion date of Phase I trials.
 We continue to monitor the status of the pandemic and will adjust our strategy accordingly in order to mitigate the impact on our research projects. The Company survived the adverse effects of the 2020 Covid-19 outbreak and as at December 31, 2022 continues to carry out operations including raising funds for ongoing research and product development.
 On February 11, 2022, the Company held its first annual stockholder meeting. The meeting was held solely by means of remote communication due to COVID-19 concerns. At the meeting, the Company: (i) elected Clarence Smith and Ed McDonough as directors of the Company; (ii) approved the amendment and restatement of the Company’s Articles of Incorporation to, among other things, increase the number of authorized shares of common stock to 500,000,000; (iii) voted, in an advisory vote, to approve the compensation of the Company’s named executive officers; (iv) voted, in an advisory vote, to conduct an advisory vote on compensation of the Company’s named executive officers every three years; and (v) approved the appointment of Davidson & Company LLP, Chartered Professional Accountants, as the Company’s independent accounting firm for the 2022 fiscal year.
 During the year 2022 the Company developed an ophthalmic formulation and completed efficacy testing in a dry eye formulation and various dosages. Phase I clinical trials conducted by Dr. James Shapiro were reactivated but access to qualified patients has been slow and progress minimal since global pandemic. The Company is making a concerted effort to find strategic partners and is the impressive accumulation of research data to attract potential partners or buyers of the Company. Industry leaders in biochemistry and pharmaceuticals, both domestic and international, are potential partners.
 
Research and Development
 
Our business depends on our ability to sponsor research and development activities.  For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company incurred total research and development expenses of $435,872.  For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred total research and development expenses of $448,873.  In order to reach the Company’s goals of developing a marketable product, we will need to increase the funding of our research and development activities which at this time is limited by our ability to raise money to fund the Company.
