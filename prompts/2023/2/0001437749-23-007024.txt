ITEM 1. BUSINESSOrganizational History

On June 22, 2017, the Group filed an Amended Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Oklahoma to change its name from “3DIcon Corporation” to “The Coretec Group Inc.”, which became effective on June 29, 2017.
 
The Group, formerly known as 3DIcon Corporation, was incorporated on August 11, 1995, under the laws of the State of Oklahoma. Prior to September 30, 2016, the Group’s primary activity had been the raising of capital in order to pursue its goal of becoming a significant participant in the development, commercialization and marketing of next generation 3D display technologies.
 
On September 30, 2016, Coretec Industries LLC became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, and the Group issued an aggregate 15,870 shares of the Group’s Series B Convertible Preferred Stock; those shares were subsequently converted into 30,374,363 shares of common stock. 
 
Overview of the Company.
 
Coretec’s Technology. The Coretec Group owns intellectual property and patents related to the production and application of engineered silicon to enable new technologies and to improve the lifespan and performance of a variety of materials in a range of industries. The Company is exploring opportunities to use its silicon discoveries and developments to improve the performance of lithium-ion batteries, solid-state LED lights and semiconductors, among other technologies. It is also exploring ways to use its intellectual property to develop optical plastics to advance development of its CSpace 3D imaging chamber.
Endurion. The Company is developing a lithium-ion battery with a silicon-based anode under the name Endurion. The battery industry acknowledges silicon as the next frontier in increasing battery life and utility. To date, battery developers have experienced expansion and contraction problems with silicon anodes including continual formation and degradation of solid-electrolyte-interphase (SEI) material as lithium-ions are absorbed and discharged. During this process, silicon particles can break down, immediately reducing the charging capacity of the anodes. Additionally, the continual formation of SEI material consumes lithium-ions that are then unavailable for charging and can cause negative effects on cycle life. The Company’s battery development program, Endurion, addresses this problem by using silicon-based nanoparticles to mitigate the swelling and pulverization issues that are common in early iterations of silicon anodes. Additionally, Endurion nanoparticles are being engineered with an inherent SEI layer that will allow better conduction of lithium-ions across the SEI layer, thus leading to better cycle life. Using a bottom-up wet chemistry approach, Endurion is being designed to increase energy density in batteries and allow for greater endurance, enhanced performance, and larger capacity in burgeoning applications such as electric vehicles, military technologies, mobile devices, and space exploration.
 
Cyclohexasilane (CHS). Coretec’s underlying technology is focused on the production of a high-value liquid silicon precursor, cyclohexasilane (“CHS”). A key advantage of CHS is that it remains in liquid form at room temperature and does not convert to a gas until heated above 450°F. CHS is superior to other silicon precursor in many ways compared to materials commonly used for manufacturing silicon-based semiconductors and solar cells (monosilane or trichlorosilane), which have much lower boiling points that require more prescriptive handling that results in higher shipping and handling costs. Using CHS offers several potential technical advantages of using CHS versus common silicon precursors. The Company anticipates that CHS will first be used as an alternative to monosilane or trichlorosilane when adding silicon to lithium ion batteries or when used in manufacturing silicon-based semiconductors.
 
The Company also envisions long-term potential in several emerging markets where there are opportunities to convert CHS into nanoparticles and nanowires, for such purposes as:
 
● | Energy storage
--+---------------


● | Solid-state LED lighting
--+-------------------------


● | Light sensing spectrometers
--+----------------------------


● | Printable electronics
--+----------------------


● | Building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) solar energy
--+-----------------------------------------------------

Enhancement of CSpace. The Company’s CSpace segment is developing technologies to produce 360-degree volumetric, high-resolution images in a 3D image chamber. The Company is applying its technical expertise and intellectual property in silicon-based materials to advance commercialization prospects for its CSpace technology.
 
A key challenge in the evolution of CSpace® is the development of the material used for the image chamber. The Company is exploring and testing a variety of glass alternatives with a focus primarily in optimizing the weight and cost of a glass medium.
 
Near-Term Revenue Opportunities. Opportunities for near-term revenue continue to be explored in battery and microelectronic markets. Interest in the use of silicon in Li-ion batteries continues to increase driven by the growing demand for electrical vehicles, the growth of mobile electronics, and energy storage systems for backup power in commercial wind and solar systems. Discussions are ongoing with end-users of Li-ion battery anode materials that are seeking next generation materials to further increase performance while improving lifetime, charging time, safety and reliability.
 
We believe these users will be well positioned to benefit from Endurion. While we believe Endurion will provide near term revenue, we also continue to explore revenue opportunities with CHS in microelectronics and especially those early adopter markets where advanced microelectronics are being developed in lower volumes and with less price sensitivity. 
 
Endurion Business
 
The global demand for an improved battery is increasing exponentially. The lithium-ion battery market size is expected to grow from $45 billion in 2022 to $135 billion by 2031; with a compounded annual growth rate of 13% over that time period. The Company’s plan is to develop a Li-ion battery with a silicon-based anode. Research has shown that silicon has a 10X increased capacity of energy storage. So, even incremental amounts of silicon in the traditional graphite matrix could contribute substantially to overall increased anode capacity. The Coretec Group’s unique functionalized silicon nanoparticle anode material with an engineered SEI layer allows greater ability to access the unique material properties of silicon potentially leading to increased energy density, faster charging, and enhanced cycle life. 
Endurion Business Model
 
Coretec’s business model for Endurion is to use its expertise in engineering silicon to create modified silicon nanoparticles for the Endurion battery. The Company uses its personnel, laboratory, and physical assets to research and develop Endurion. In addition, the Company will utilize the resources of outside vendors for products and services including outside testing providers, chemical material suppliers, and battery manufacturers.
Potential Applications for Endurion Revenue
 

● | Electric vehicles
--+------------------


● | Consumer electronics
--+---------------------


● | Stationery and utility-scale energy storage for green energy development – wind and solar
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Military vehicles, drones, and weapon systems as well as wearable power for soldiers
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Endurion Competition
 
The global lithium-ion battery market size was valued at USD $45 billion in 2022 and a number of multi-billion dollar companies such as Panasonic and Samsung manufacture Li-ion batteries. Lithium silicon batteries are a subclass of the total Li-ion battery market.  The global adoption of electric vehicles is driving the growth in battery innovation.  A number of private and public companies are attempting to improve lithium-ion batteries by using silicon in the battery anode.  To date, a proven solution for a silicon based anode has yet to be commercialized on a large scale.
 
The Company’s wet chemistry approach is innovative and ground breaking.  The Endurion technology will produce an anode for lithium-ion batteries with an artificial SEI layer on silicon nanoparticles.  The competitive advantage of Endurion is realizing the immense benefits of silicon in lithium-ion batteries and achieving:
 

● | Greater energy density
--+-----------------------


● | Faster charging
--+----------------


● | Improved cycle life
--+--------------------

Cyclohexasilane Business
 
The Company’s business model is to identify and commercialize disruptive technologies requiring silicon that serve advanced technology markets. Sources of disruptive technology are often licensed technology created by major universities, institutes, national laboratories and other research centers. Where technology does not already exist, the Company intends to sponsor and jointly develop research with its customers, as well continue its research in the Company’s lab.
 
Coretec is developing, testing, and providing new and/or improved technologies and resulting product solutions for energy-related industries including, but not limited to energy storage, renewable energy, energy conservation, and distributed energy industries. Many of these technologies and resulting product solutions can also be applied to the broader markets of anti-counterfeit packaging, medical devices, electronics, photonics, and displays. The initial technologies and product solutions are based on new innovations in:
 
● | Cyclohexasilane (Si6H12) 
--+--------------------------------------------------------
● | Silicon quantum dots (Si QDs) 
● | “Stacked” polysilane ((R2Si)n) 
● | Doped alloy variants of the various silicon innovations
● | Future, high-refractive-index siloxane polymers (HRISP)

 
Early adoption of these technologies and resulting product solutions is anticipated in markets for energy storage (lithium-ion batteries), solid-state lighting (LEDs), solar energy and printable electronics.
 
Coretec’s management leverages years of expertise and experience in equipment and services for the energy storage industry, procuring and managing investments and financial services, and in R&D and commercialization of material and chemical technologies.
 
CHS Business Model
 
Coretec’s business model includes monitoring the ever-growing catalogue of new technologies and valuable IP for licensing opportunities that could lead to incremental improvements and/or additional features in resulting products or lead to next generation products for use by energy-related industries and is created and held within universities and other parties that may lack financial resources and/or interest to further develop and commercialize them.
 
Additionally, where needs exist, but new technologies and resulting products are not currently available, the Company aims to conduct research-and-development (“R&D”) activities through sponsored projects performed at major universities, institutes, national laboratories and other research centers. Coretec will leverage existing, world-class expertise, experience, and laboratory facilities in these non-profit entities for R&D, testing, and proof-of-concept studies up to and including studies at the device level that may be required to create commercialization opportunities.
 
Following these proof-of-concept studies, commercialization opportunities (e.g., manufacturing, marketing, sales) created for its technologies and IP will include, but are not limited to:
 

● | Joint ventures or other business collaborations with Coretec’s joint development partners who can manufacture, market and sell new or improved products (based upon Coretec’s technologies and IP) into existing or new supply chains
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Manufacturing, marketing and selling its own products 
● | Creating exit strategies such as: 


o | The sale of one or more technologies and related IP to the private sector 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o | The licensing of and/or sublicensing of one or more technologies and related IP to the private sector
o | Other business transactions, such as mergers, acquisitions and spinoffs 

 
   7

  

CHS Research & Development
 
Coretec’s priorities for R&D and commercialization are customer- and market-driven and guided by the needs and specifications of the energy-related industries served. Identified customer- and market-driven opportunities include:

● | Novel silicon-based materials that facilitate “greener” more eco-friendly energy production, including:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Lower-cost, longer-life, higher-capacity battery energy storage systems, such as lithium-ion batteries (LiBs), for use in transportation and distributed power-generation systems 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o | More aesthetically appealing, lower cost building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) 
o | Flexible and/or printable electronics for use in monitoring the condition of distributed or remote assets, e.g., wind power and embedded, wireless sensors to detect corrosion and other changes in pipelines.


● | Novel silicon-based materials that facilitate “greener” more energy efficient products, such as the encapsulation of high-brightness LEDs to improve light extraction, and solar cells to improve full-spectrum light collection 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Novel silicon-based materials that facilitate more efficient and eco-friendly exploration and monitoring of distributed energy industries, including imaging materials for visualizing oil and gas exploration and distribution data using volumetric 3D displays 
● | Novel silicon-based materials that prevent illegal imitation or reproduction of a product or service used within energy-related industries, including trusted-supply products (anti-counterfeit packaging) for supply chain assurance, currency, identity documents, lottery tickets, etc.

Future CHS Revenue
 
In the future, the Company anticipates revenue from one or more business transactions, such as:
 

● | The sale of Coretec novel silicon-based materials that improve or otherwise enhance the performance of such products as lithium-ion batteries, electronics, solar cells, and displays and/or other optical-based devices
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | A share of the revenue from the sale of jointly developed product(s) and/or from one or more joint ventures with strategic partners 
● | The sale or licensing of technologies and associated intellectual property to joint development partners or other companies 

 
CHS Competition
 
Based on market research and competitive analysis, the Company believes its CHS technology is unique and provides an advantage in that should allow for 1) high-yield, low-cost production using readily available raw materials, 2) storage, transport and use as a liquid at room temperature 3) processing of the liquid into fibers, particles, and films that, when heated, form silicon, and 4) the creation of doped silicon by doping CHS at an atomic level. Competing silanes provided by numerous manufacturers exist as a gas at room temperature, making them explosive. This results in greater costs for storage, handling, transportation and use. The closest competitor to Coretec’s CHS is cyclopentasilane which exists as a gas at room temperature. Cyclopentasilane has proven costly and difficult to manufacture. Other competitors exist for specific applications. For example, graphene and carbon nanotubes are potential competitors in printable electronics. However, they are only now emerging and require a purification process that is proving costly. 
 
Coretec’s business and commercialization model is based in part upon establishing joint development partnerships with companies that are commercially successful and financially sound as well as deeply embedded in the supply chains for the aforementioned energy-related products. For example, Coretec is developing a strategic partnership with a domestic supplier of silicon-based materials that will facilitate further development and scale-up of cyclohexasilane (Si6H12) plus chemical derivatives and other materials based on CHS. This strategic partnership will enable Coretec to supply large quantities of these novel silicon materials to those companies interested in producing prototype batteries, electronics, and photovoltaic/solar cells for testing and commercial evaluation. Coretec will continue to seek other such strategic partnerships within the private sector.
 
Volumetric 3D Display Business
 
The Company owns the rights to a patented volumetric 3D display technology that was developed by and with the University of Oklahoma (the “University”) under a Sponsored Research Agreement (“SRA”). The development to date has resulted in multiple technologies, two working laboratory prototypes (Lab Proto 1 and Lab Proto 2). Under the SRA, the Company has obtained the exclusive worldwide marketing rights to these 3D display technologies. On December 28, 2010, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) approved the patent called “Light Surface Display for Rendering a Three-Dimensional Image,” and issued the United States Patent No. 7,858,913. On August 21, 2012, the USPTO approved a continuation patent called “3D Volumetric Display” and issued the US Patent No. 8,247,755. These patents describe the foundation of what is called CSpace® technology (“CSpace”).
 
   8

  

Overview of Volumetric 3D Display Technology 
 
CSpace is a patented glasses-free 3D static volumetric display technology that is being designed to produce high-resolution full- color, true 3D images from 3D datasets generated by imaging systems or transformed from raw datasets (e.g., cyber data) that can benefit from visualization in 3D. Coretec CSpace will deliver 800 million voxels in a full color desktop format having a 360 degree viewing angle. The creation of high resolution images in a glass chamber reduces eye and cognitive fatigue that can degrade user comfort, endurance and reliability during decision making
Commercialization Strategy and Target Applications
 
The Company plans to commercialize the CSpace volumetric 3D technology through customer-funded research-and-development contracts and technology licensing agreements for such high-value applications as air-traffic control, design visualization, and medical imaging. The Company plans to develop products for contract engineering and with joint development customers. At this time the Company does not have any commercialized products and does not plan to develop its own products based on the CSpace technology due to the high –value, low-volume nature of the best-fit initial applications for this technology. These applications include but are not limited to the following:

● | Healthcare (diagnostics, surgical planning, training, telemedicine, bio surveillance) 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Cybersecurity data visualization 
● | Military (operational planning, training, modeling and simulation, battlespace awareness, damage assessment, autonomous piloting)
● | Physical security (passenger, luggage & cargo screening) 
● | Mining, oil & gas exploration 
● | Meteorological and oceanographic data visualization 

 
CSpace Competition
 
Based on market research, we have concluded that the CSpace volumetric technology is unique and advantaged versus other 3D technologies in that it can deliver both 1) a true 360-degree viewing experience for multiple simultaneous users, and 2) high image quality, high reliability and large image size. Rear projection 3D displays such as those from Zecotek, Setred, and EuroLCDs (formerly LC Tech LightSpace) do not provide a 360-degree viewing experience and are typically limited to one or two users. Early proof-of-concept work done on infrared active phosphor displays by 3D Display Laboratories proved to not be scalable due to limited phosphor persistence and vector scanning limitations. While holographic and light-field displays show promise, they do not deliver a true 360-degree viewing experience and cost-effective multiple user systems do not appear feasible due to current and expected pixel density, data bandwidth and compute power limitations.
 
History of 3D Technology Research and Development at the University of Oklahoma
 
Beginning in 2007 the University, under an SRA with the Company, undertook the development of high potential 3D display technologies. It is anticipated that Coretec’s technology will play a key role in the continued development of an image space material for CSpace.

On January 25, 2022, the Company named Katie Merx its Vice President of Communications. Merx will have overall responsibility for the Company’s global communications, including brand messaging, corporate and financial communications, executive support, and media relations.
 
On February 24, 2022, the Company announced the hiring of a full-time research scientist and opening of a new wet laboratory. The Company plans to use the lab to develop CHS, create silicon quantum dots, and create silicon-anode active materials for lithium-ion batteries. The lab design includes a fume hood and glove box, which is necessary to handle pyrophoric materials such as silane gases and certain hydrides.
 
On February 28, 2022, the Company filed a full utility patent on its provisional patent for the development of advanced silicon anodes using CHS and other silanes. This patent application covers the use of CHS to produce a wide variety of silicon anodes for use in lithium-ion batteries. 
 
On March 16, 2022 the Company presented at a two-day U.S. conference on accelerating the development of a domestic battery supply chain. Representing the Company was Dr. Michelle Tokarz, Vice President of Partnerships and Innovation. Tokarz spoke about the Company’s development of a lithium-ion battery with a silicon anode. The Company is using the unique characteristics of cyclohexasilane and similar molecules to enhance the performance of silicon anodes. The Company’s approach is new to the industry and protected by the Company’s recent application for a full utility patent.
 
On April 29, 2022 the Company held its Q1 2022 shareholder call and announced its battery development program, Endurion. Endurion is being designed to improve battery cycling stability, enable longer run times, and allow for greater energy density in applications such as electric vehicles, military technologies, mobile devices, and space exploration.
 
On June 3, 2022 the Company filed a trademark application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for Endurion.
 
On June 7, 2022 the Company announced its participation and planned attendance in electric vehicles and battery conferences and tradeshows. The Company plans to leverage the EV and battery industries’ top technical, business, and networking events to strengthen and expand its relationships, meet potential partners and clients, and grow awareness of the Company’s Endurion battery development program.
 
On June 28, 2022 the Company announced the appointment of cleantech public relations firm FischTank PR to bolster visibility in cleantech, automotive and electric vehicle sectors. FischTank PR will cover the responsibilities of Katie Merx, Vice President of Communications who left the Company in June of 2022.
 
On August 17, 2022 the Company held a shareholder call to discuss the Company’s achievements in 2022, while also providing insights into the growth and development goals the Company aims to achieve. In the first half of this year, Coretec devoted significant time and resources developing its Endurion battery program, which applies the Company’s expertise in silicon nanoparticles to manufacture silicon anodes for faster-charging, improved cycling, and increased energy density lithium-ion batteries. The Company also discussed the opening of its own, fully operational wet laboratory, the hiring of Research Scientist, Dr. Nathanael Downes, Ph.D. and filing a full utility patent on the company’s provisional patent for the development of advanced silicon anodes using CHS and other silanes.
 
On September 7, 2022 the Company provided an update on its CSpace technology partnership with The University of Adelaide. For background, the Company’s CSpace technology controls two invisible infrared lasers to generate visible, 3D image pixels in an imaging chamber. The imaging chamber relies on rare earth ions that are dispersed within the chamber material to create visible pixels at the locations where the two lasers intersect. 3D images are created by scanning the two lasers across the imaging chamber material. The Company has previously examined the use of low-phonon energy NaYF4 single crystal, and ZBLAN fluoride glass as the imaging chamber material.
 
The challenge in creating high-quality imaging is both materials are difficult to produce at a sufficient quality and size, certainly not enough to be considered commercially useful. Currently, the University is examining four types of alternative low-phonon energy glasses that hold potential for large-scale manufacturing with high optical quality.
 
As a first proof-of-concept step, they have fabricated four small-scale (1-inch) glasses, doped with the same amount of the rare earth ion Er3+ which can generate green image pixels using a dual-infrared laser system. According to preliminary results, a specific type of heavy metal oxide glass is brighter than the reference ZBLAN fluoride glass under the pulsed dual-infrared laser system at Adelaide, while the other types of glasses are considerably dimmer.
 
On September 27, 2022 the Company reported initial findings from its cyclohexasilane (CHS) testing with the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission. Earlier this year, the Company began working with Pascale Chenevier, Senior Scientist in nanosciences for energy at the CEA in France, to test the potential growth of silicon nanowires, a key material in the development of lithium-ion batteries.
 
   11

  

The goal of the tests was to determine the ability to grow silicon nanowires from the Company’s proprietary CHS technology. During initial testing, The CEA found promising results. The organization has previously used several silane-based materials in their research and revealed that CHS demonstrated the lowest deposition temperatures they have observed to date and showed the highest yields of silicon nanomaterials. Additionally, the testing found a unique hybrid of composite materials, consisting of both nanowires as well as nanoflakes, when using CHS as a silicon source. 
 
On October 14, 2022, the Company granted options to purchase a total of 24,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $0.0277 per share. The options are exercisable for a period of five years from the date of issuance. Of the 24,000,000 total options granted, (i) options to purchase 3,000,000 shares of common stock were granted to Victor Keen, the Company’s co-chairman; (ii) options to purchase 3,000,000 shares of common stock were issued to Simon Calton, the Company’s co-chairman; (iii) options to purchase 7,000,000 shares of common stock were issued to Matthew Kappers, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Director; (iv) options to purchase 5,000,000 shares of common stock were issued to Matthew Hoffman, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer; and (vi) options to purchase an aggregate of 6,000,000 shares of common stock were issued to various employees and consultants of the Company.
 
On October 17, 2022, Michael Kraft resigned as President of the Company with immediate effect. Following Mr. Kraft’s resignation, he will serve as Senior Advisor to the Company.
 
On October 18, 2022, the Company announced the appointment of Matthew Hoffman, Chief Financial Officer of the Company, as Chief Operating Officer of the Company. In connection with Mr. Hoffman’s appointment as COO, the Company entered into an employment agreement (“Employment Agreement”) with Mr. Hoffman. Pursuant to the Employment Agreement, Mr. Hoffman will receive an annual base salary of $200,000. Mr. Hoffman will also be eligible for an annual incentive bonus, with a target payout of twenty percent (20%) of his then-current base salary, beginning with the Company’s 2023 fiscal year, upon meeting objectives set by the board of directors.
 
On January 12, 2023, Douglas Freitag resigned as a member of the Board of Directors of The Company. Mr. Freitag will continue to support and advise the Company in the capacity of senior consultant. Mr. Freitag’s resignation was not as a result of any disagreements with the Company’s board of directors or management, but to allow him for sufficient time to commit to his primary business.
