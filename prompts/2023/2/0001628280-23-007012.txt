Item 1.    Business
Limbach Holdings, Inc. (the “Company,” “we” or “us”), a Delaware corporation headquartered in Warrendale, Pennsylvania, was formed on July 20, 2016 as a result of a business combination with Limbach Holdings LLC (“LHLLC”). The Company is a building systems solutions firm with expertise in the design, prefabrication, installation, management and maintenance of heating, ventilation, air-conditioning (“HVAC”), mechanical, electrical, plumbing and controls systems. The Company provides comprehensive facility services consisting of mechanical construction, full HVAC service and maintenance, energy audits and retrofits, engineering and design build services, constructability evaluation, equipment and materials selection, offsite/prefabrication construction, and the complete range of sustainable building solutions. The Company partners with institutions with mission-critical infrastructures, such as data centers and healthcare, industrial and light manufacturing, cultural and entertainment, higher education, and life science facilities. The Company operates primarily in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Midwest regions of the United States.
As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries included Limbach Company LLC (“LC LLC”), which operates in New England, Eastern Pennsylvania, Western Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Ohio, Michigan and the Mid-Atlantic region; Limbach Company LP (“LC LP”), which operates in the Southern California region; Harper Limbach LLC (“Harper Limbach”), a Florida-based subsidiary, Jake Marshall, LLC (“JMLLC”) and Coating Solutions, LLC (“CSLLC”), both of which are Tennessee-based subsidiaries and Limbach Facility & Project Solutions LLC. Each of our operations provide design, construction and maintenance services in some or all of the HVAC, plumbing and electrical fields.
The Jake Marshall Transaction. On December 2, 2021 (the “Effective Date”), the Company and Limbach Facility Services LLC (“LFS”), a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with JMLLC and CSLLC (together with JMLLC, the “Acquired Companies” and each an “Acquired Company”) and the owners of the Acquired Companies (collectively, the “Sellers”), pursuant to which LFS purchased all of the outstanding membership interests in the Acquired Companies from the Sellers (the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement collectively being the “Jake Marshall Transaction”). The Jake Marshall Transaction closed on the Effective Date. As a result of the Jake Marshall Transaction, each of the Acquired Companies became wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company. The acquisition expanded the Company’s market share within its existing product and service lines. 
See Note 3 – Acquisitions in the accompanying notes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for further information on the Jake Marshall Transaction.
Southern California Region. In February 2022, the Company announced its strategic decision to wind down its Southern California GCR and ODR operations. The decision was made to better align the Company’s customer geographic focus and to reduce losses related to unprofitable locations. The Company is currently in the closeout phases on its remaining Southern California business unit projects and expects to fully exit the Southern California region in 2023 aside from certain operational warranty obligations. However, the Company is party to the terms of a sublease agreement for its leased premises in Southern California through April 2027 and remains obligated under the original lease for such office space in the event the sublessee fails to satisfy its obligations under the sublease agreement. See Note 14 – Leases in the accompanying notes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for further information on the Southern California Sublease.
Segments
The Company operates in two segments, (i) General Contractor Relationships (“GCR”), in which the Company generally manages new construction or renovation projects that involve primarily HVAC, plumbing, or electrical services awarded to the Company by general contractors or construction managers, and (ii) Owner Direct Relationships (“ODR”), in which the Company performs owner direct construction projects and/or provides maintenance or services primarily on HVAC, plumbing or electrical systems, building controls and specialty contracting projects direct to, or assigned by, building owners or property managers. This work is primarily performed under fixed price, modified fixed price, and time and material contracts over periods of typically less than two years. 
GCR Segment. The Company’s GCR revenue decreased by 19.9% to $280.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $350.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in GCR revenue was primarily due to our continued focus on improving project execution and profitability by pursuing opportunities that are smaller in size, shorter in duration, and where we can leverage our captive design and engineering services. Gross profit improved to 13.8% for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 13.0% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company provides its GCR segment services through a variety of project delivery methodologies.
• Competitive Lump Sum Bidding (also referred to as “Plan & Spec” Bidding). Plan & Spec bidding is a competitive bid process among multiple contractors bidding on nearly complete or completed design documents based on a lump sum price for delivery of the project. Price is the predominant selection criteria in this process.
• Design/Assist. Design/Assist is a process in which a specialty contractor is selected among competing contractors using best value methodology. In best value, a selection is made based primarily upon qualifications and project approach, and secondarily on select cost factors. Cost factors are usually limited to a fixed fee and expense estimate and an estimate of the cost of work. With Design/Assist, the specialty contractor is typically contracted early in the design process to provide design and preconstruction input as needed to assist the customer in maintaining the established budget and completing design and drawings. This delivery option often includes a guaranteed maximum price (“GMP”) on a fixed fee basis; however, sometimes the owner may offer a lump sum price to be established following the completion of design. Typically, once the specialty contractor is selected, there is no further competition. In some cases, the owner has the option of holding a competitive process at the end of design. On occasion, an owner may arrange for a cost-plus fixed fee arrangement exclusive of a GMP or lump sum arrangement.
• Design/Build. Design/Build projects may be secured on a best value or qualification-based selection basis. A Design/Build contract may be delivered as a lump sum or GMP. With Design/Build, a prime general contractor (“GC”)/construction manager (“CM”) or other contractor will directly contract with a building owner. In many cases, the prime contractor will also procure specialty contracting services on a Design/Build lump sum or GMP basis. On occasion, the Company has the opportunity to provide Re-design/Build services. With Re-design/Build, the Company typically contracts on a Design/Assist basis to participate during the design phase, as described above. If the project’s HVAC, plumbing and/or electrical design is substantially over budget, then the Company may offer to re-design the project and bring the project back into budget. Higher margins may be earned on these contracts in comparison to Design/Assist contracts and can be executed with less risk due to having designed the systems.
• Performance Contracting. In select locations within specific market sectors, the Company provides performance contracting to building owners. Performance contracting involves the assessment of a building owner’s facilities and offers a proposal to reduce energy and operating costs over a specified period of time. Energy and operating savings are delivered through replacement of energy or cost inefficient systems and equipment with more efficient systems. The Company’s performance contracting team is able to deliver the capital improvements using our Design/Build platform and then, in some instances, guarantee the energy and operating systems over an agreed upon time-frame. In most cases, the building owner provides the financing for performance contracting. In other cases, the Company arranges for third-party financing as part of the contract. Typically, performance contracts are offered on a negotiated basis. Negotiated contracts can provide for higher margins and lower risk than conventional projects. To assure the Company’s cost and operating saving guarantees, the Company requires that it provides maintenance services during the term of the agreement. 
ODR Segment. The Company’s ODR revenue increased by 54.2% to $216.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $140.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in year-over-year ODR segment revenue was primarily due to the Company's continued focus on the accelerated growth of its ODR business. Gross profit decreased to 25.5% for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 28.9% for the year ended December 31, 2021. 
The Company’s key business initiatives for its ODR segment include the establishment of long-term relationships with building owners on a direct basis as compared to contracting with a GC/CM. The Company strives to convert GCR projects into ODR business opportunities. In addition, the Company’s ODR segment has been successfully scaleable through organic business growth while working directly with building owners. A large portion of the Company’s maintenance services are delivered to building owners for whom the Company has not performed construction or renovation services. The Company believes that its ODR services offerings provide a distribution channel through which it can continue to deliver an expanded offering of value-added services direct to building owners that further reinforces its value proposition and differentiated capabilities. The Company provides its ODR business services through both a variety of project delivery methodologies and other service and technical offerings:
• Owner Direct Projects. Smaller than typical GCR construction projects, this work is contracted directly for a building owner for which the Company is capable of performing the same project delivery methodologies akin to its GCR offerings. On projects that are predominantly HVAC, plumbing, and/or electrical in scope, the Company may act as the “prime” GC. 
•Maintenance Contracts. Through “evergreen” contracts, the Company provides maintenance services for HVAC, electrical and/or plumbing systems and equipment.
• Time-and-Materials. Time-and-materials is construction and/or service work performed on an emergency basis for building owners who are already under contract with the Company for construction and/or maintenance work.
• Automatic Temperature Controls (“ATC”). The Company provides design, installation and maintenance for specialized ATC systems through its maintenance and construction platforms to building owners and GC/CM customers.
• Special Projects Division (“SPD”). In addition to the Company’s major construction projects and its maintenance services, the Company provides construction services through its special project divisions (“SPD”). Each of the Company’s branch locations offers SPD services. SPD services are typically less than $0.5 million in construction cost and have short durations and limited scopes of work. These projects are primarily secured through lump sum competitive bids, though on occasion these projects may be negotiated. When design is required for an SPD project, Limbach Collaborative Services (“LCS”), formerly Limbach Engineering & Design Services, often supports the contract. Although SPD work is normally performed on projects under $0.5 million, the margins earned on these projects can be substantially higher than larger construction projects. Typically, the project duration for SPD services is shorter than that of large construction projects, and can sometimes be completed in less than 30 days.
• Limbach Insights. Limbach Insights provides the means to manage facility and asset data to empower data driven decisions. The Company’s facility analytic solutions includes: i) energy management and sustainability through real-time tracking and monitoring, ii) asset management, iii) predictive maintenance and iv) virtual facility management services. Limbach Insights is a tool used for customer facilities to help reduce operating costs, extend the life cycle of your equipment, and uncover energy savings to reduce your carbon footprint.
The Company’s aforementioned ODR business services profile offers recurring and/or repeatable business opportunities. In addition, due to the Company’s on-going contractual relationships with certain building owners established through certain of its service offerings, it is well positioned with those owners when they are ready to initiate capital construction projects. As a result, the Company's maintenance, time-and-materials, ATC, SPD and Limbach Insights often lead, drive and support the revenue associated with owner direct projects.
For additional financial information about the Company’s operating segments, see Note 12 – Operating Segments in the accompanying notes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Limbach Collaborative Services. Located in Orlando, Florida, LCS provides captive engineering capabilities, estimating and virtual design services. LCS provides professional engineering, energy analysis, estimation, and detail design and three-dimensional building installation coordination services to our various business units, direct to building owners, and clients in both our GCR and ODR segments. This capability allows the Company to leverage these services across its entire business. In addition, this capability distinguishes the Company from competitors that more typically provide Design/Build services by hiring external engineering companies. By providing professional engineering through LCS, the Company delivers integrated Design/Build services to the market. By bundling engineering services with construction, the Company’s clients avoid the costly expense of separate engineering services.
The core capability of LCS is professional engineering. Combined throughout the Company’s business, it maintains seven registered professional engineers on staff, who are supported by a staff of approximately 31 estimators and designers. LCS acts as the engineer of record for projects where the Company serves as a Design/Build specialty contractor. LCS engineers have experience in healthcare, institutional, commercial, hospitality, and industrial projects. The Company’s operations in all of its regions have complete access to a large staff of professional engineers and designers through LCS. LCS controls the development and maintenance of the Company’s Limbach Modeling and Production System (“LMPS”). LMPS is a comprehensive database, workflow, and reporting system used by LCS and all of the Company’s business units to design, estimate, plan, and track construction projects. The Company believes LMPS is unique in the industry and provides a competitive advantage by providing highly technical services in-house in a cost effective manner. LMPS is a Building Information Modeling (“BIM”) tool that allows the Company to construct mechanical, electrical and plumbing engineering (“MEP”) systems in a virtual environment, avoid conflicts in the field, eliminate rework caused by coordination issues, maximize the use of off-site prefabrication of assemblies, and capture installation productivity and construction progress. The Company utilizes LMPS beginning with the original engineering concept and throughout the construction process to continuously monitor progress and avoid wasted efforts. Many others in the industry expend additional costs to third parties for redrawing and remodeling effort to achieve the same results.
Strategy
The Company focuses on creating value for building owners by targeting opportunities for long-term relationships with the vision of becoming an indispensable partner to building owners with mission-critical systems. The key objectives of the 
Company’s strategy is to improve profitability and generate quality growth in its operations, to enable sustainable and efficient building environments, to continue investing in its workforce and to acquire strategically synergistic businesses. In order to accomplish the Company’s objectives, it is currently focused on the following areas:
ODR Growth Initiative. The Company’s principal focus over the past few years, and a focus that the Company plans to continue in coming years, is the accelerated growth of its ODR segment, which includes maintenance services, small projects, building controls installation and service, building environment management and performance services, and other project opportunities performed direct for building owners. The Company is focused on expanding the number and breadth of owner relationships that it serves on a direct basis and to leverage these expanded owner-direct relationships to deliver a broad suite of services. In addition, the Company proactively manages its current accounts and maintains a high standard of dedication to those account relationships. The Company has made substantial investments to expand its ODR revenue by increasing the value it can offer to service and maintenance customers. The Company is actively concentrating managerial and sales resources on training and hiring experienced employees to sell and profitably perform ODR work. In many locations, the Company has added or upgraded its capabilities and the Company believes its investments and efforts have provided customer value and stimulated growth. To further enhance the Company’s ODR services within one of its largest market sectors, healthcare, the Company offers Program Management Services. Program Management Services provide the Company’s healthcare customers with advisory support and strategic guidance to help match their long-term facility needs. These services include the defining of capital program needs for new and existing facilities. In addition, these services offer assessments of existing facilities for project upgrades to improve the operations of the buildings tied to MEP systems.
The Company continues to expand its owner-direct offerings to include other digital solutions to manage and monitor the performance of building systems, including data analytics, energy consumption and sustainability. These services allow the Company to develop new revenue streams leveraging its professional services capabilities, to support multi-location regional and national customers in core end-markets, and to drive energy retrofit and performance optimization projects for building owners.
Improved GCR Segment Margins. In the Company’s GCR segment, its efforts continue to focus on improving project execution and profitability by pursuing opportunities that are smaller in size and shorter in duration than historically, and where it can leverage its captive design and engineering services.
Maintain a Diverse Customer, Geographic and Project Base. The Company has a distribution of revenue across end-use sectors that it believes reduces its exposure to negative developments in any given sector. Currently, the Company also has significant geographical diversification across regions that are generally located in the eastern portions of the United States, again reducing its exposure to negative developments in any given region. The Company’s core market sectors consist of the following customer base with mission-critical systems:
•Healthcare, including research, acute care and inpatient hospitals for regional and national hospital groups, and pharmaceutical and biotech laboratories and manufacturing facilities;
•Data Centers, including facilities composed of networked computers, storage systems and computing infrastructure that organizations use to assemble, process, store and disseminate large amounts of data;
•Industrial and light manufacturing facilities, including automotive, energy and general manufacturing plants;
•Higher Education, including both public and private colleges, universities and research centers;
•Cultural and entertainment, including sports arenas, entertainment facilities (including casinos) and amusement rides and parks; and
•Life sciences, including organizations and companies whose work is centered around research and development focused on living things.
The Company also partners with building owners in other market sectors (infrastructure, government, hospitality and commercial). It is imperative that the partnerships formed between the Company and its building owners share in similar core values. 
Investment in its Employees. Employee development underpins the Company’s efforts to execute its strategy. The Company seeks to attract and retain quality employees by providing them an enhanced career path that offers a stable income, attractive benefits packages and excellent advancement opportunities. The Company invests in its employees through safety and wellness programs, internal communication, career development training programs, recognition programs and succession planning initiatives.
Fully Integrated Operations. A core growth strategy of the Company includes offering design, construction and maintenance services for the full complement of HVAC, plumbing and electrical services in all of our business units. The Company currently offers certain of these services in each of its regions, with electrical self-perform design, installation and maintenance services being offered primarily in its Mid-Atlantic region. In addition, the Company offers electrical services through installation subcontracting in its Ohio, Eastern Pennsylvania and Florida regions. Over the coming years, the Company plans to further equip each of its regions to provide a combined offering of mechanical construction and maintenance, and building system management services. The Company believes this combined offering is appealing to building owners who own and operate facilities with complex building systems. The Company also offers services to building owners known as MEP Prime, a service where the Company acts as the general contractor on assignments that predominantly include a heavy concentration of mechanical HVAC, electrical, plumbing and building controls systems, along with other trades such as concrete and drywall, to offer a complete service package. 
Complex systems lend themselves to delivery methodologies that fit the Company’s value proposition to its customers and integrated business model, including Design/Assist and Design/Build. The Company believes that few specialty contractors in the United States offer fully integrated HVAC, plumbing and electrical services. The Company believes its integrated approach provides a significant competitive advantage, especially when combined with its proprietary design and production software systems. The Company’s integrated approach allows for increased prefabrication of HVAC components, improved cycle times for project delivery and reduced risks associated with onsite construction.
Growth through Acquisitions. The Company believes that it can further increase its cash flow and operating income by acquiring strategically synergistic companies that will increase the Company’s geographic footprint, supplement the Company’s current business model, address capability gaps and enhance the breadth of its service offerings to better serve its clients. The Company has dedicated and continues to dedicate its resources to seek opportunities to acquire and integrate businesses that have attractive market positions, a record of consistent positive cash flow, and desirable geographic market locations.
In 2022, the Company was ranked the 11th largest mechanical contractor in the United States according to information provided by Engineering News Record. 
GCR and ODR Backlog
The Company refers to its estimated revenue on uncompleted contracts, including the amount of revenue on contracts for which work has not begun, less the revenue it had recognized under such contracts, as “backlog.” Backlog includes unexercised contract options. The Company’s backlog includes projects that have a written award, a letter of intent, a notice to proceed or an agreed upon work order to perform work on mutually accepted terms and conditions. Additionally, the difference between the Company’s backlog and remaining performance obligations is due to the portion of unexercised contract options that are excluded, under certain contract types, from its remaining performance obligations as these contracts can be canceled for convenience at any time by the Company or the customer without considerable cost incurred by the customer. Additional information related to the Company’s remaining performance obligations is provided in Note 4 — Revenue from Contracts with Customers in the accompanying notes to its consolidated financial statements. See also Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Our contract backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and could be an uncertain indicator of our future earnings.”
The Company’s GCR backlog was $302.9 million and $337.2 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Projects are brought into backlog once the Company has been provided a written confirmation of award and the contract value has been established. At any point in time, the Company has a substantial volume of projects that are specifically identified and advanced in negotiations and/or documentation, however those projects are not booked as backlog until the Company has received written confirmation from the owner or the GC/CM of their intention to award it the contract and they have directed the Company to begin engineering, designing, incurring construction labor costs or procuring needed equipment and material. The Company’s GCR projects tend to be built over a 12- to 24-month schedule depending upon scope and complexity. Most major projects have a preconstruction planning phase which may require months of planning before actual construction commences. The Company is occasionally employed to deliver a “fast-track” project, where construction commences as the preconstruction planning work continues. As work on the Company’s projects progress, it increases or decreases backlog to take into account its estimate of the effects of changes in estimated quantities, changes in conditions, change orders and other variations from initially anticipated contract revenue, and the percentage of completion of the Company’s work on the projects. Based on historical trends, the Company estimates that 68% of its GCR backlog as of December 31, 2022 will be recognized as revenue during 2023. Additionally, the reduction in GCR backlog has been intentional as the Company looks to focus on higher margin projects than historically, as well as its focus on smaller, higher margin owner direct projects. 
The Company’s ODR backlog was $108.2 million and $98.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts reflect unrecognized revenue expected to be recognized over the remaining terms of our service contracts and projects. 
Based on historical trends, the Company estimates that 92% of its ODR backlog as of December 31, 2022 will be recognized as revenue during 2023. The Company believes its ODR backlog increased due to its continued focus on ODR growth. 
Customers
The Company’s customer base primarily consists of building owners and their third-party representatives, general contractors and construction managers.
The Company’s aforementioned strategic goals include continued growth of its direct relationships with building owners. Building owners control capital and operating investments. This not only improves the Company’s position when entering into construction contracts with these owners, but also allows it to build long-term relationships around recurring maintenance services and smaller repair and installation projects. This also positions the Company to deliver additional products and services in the future, including digital offerings. In its typical customer life cycle, the Company pursues opportunities to build or renovate facilities through a GC/CM. In most cases, this relationship is the Company’s primary point of entry into the building owner’s organization. However, the Company maintains hundreds of building owner relationships through its contracts for program management, maintenance, smaller project renovations and energy retrofits. In the Company’s experience, when building owners are planning a project that involves predominantly HVAC, plumbing and/or electrical services, they often ask the GC/CM to assign the work directly to the Company. For the year ended December 31, 2022, no direct ODR customer relationship accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s revenue.
The Company believes it has strong relationships with many national commercial GC/CMs. As one of its core risk management processes, the Company is selective in choosing to work with GC/CMs that have similar core values, that have a solid payment history, that have experienced and available project management labor, and who value the Company’s services and reputation. Most of the Company’s branches also maintain strong relationships with local and regional GC/CMs that fit its selection criteria. For the year ended December 31, 2022, one GCR segment customer accounted for approximately 11% of consolidated total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2021, two GCR segment customers accounted for approximately 17% and 12% of consolidated total revenue, respectively.
Competition
The HVAC, plumbing, electrical, and maintenance industry is highly competitive and the geographic markets in which the Company competes has numerous companies that provide similar services. Factors influencing the Company’s competitiveness include price, reputation for quality, ability to reduce customer costs, experience and expertise, financial strength, surety bonding capacity, knowledge of local markets and conditions, availability and experience of craft labor, and customer relationships. Competitors tend to be regional firms that vary in size and depth of resources. There are, however, significant national competitors that have greater national presence and breadth of expertise than the Company does.
Materials & Equipment
The Company purchases materials, including sheet metal, steel and copper piping, electrical conduit, wire and other various materials from numerous sources. The Company also purchases equipment from various manufacturers. The price and availability of materials and equipment may vary from year to year due to market conditions and industry production capacities. Economic disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic (defined below), including supply chain, production, and other logistical issues, as well as escalating commodity prices, have and may continue to negatively impact our business. For example, the Company has experienced lead times significantly in excess of normal levels while also experiencing the effects of inflation through increases in fuel, material, and other commodity prices. These disruptions have escalated in 2022 and have manifested themselves most notably through project delays and reduced labor productivity and efficiency, particularly within our GCR segment. In response to these challenges, the Company continues to strive to more effectively manage its business through enhanced labor planning and project scheduling, increased pricing to the extent contractually permitted, and by leveraging the Company's relationships with its suppliers and customers. However, the impact of these disruptions continues to evolve and the conflict in Ukraine has added another layer of uncertainty, as described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors — The ongoing military conflict between Ukraine and Russia has caused unstable market and economic conditions and is expected to have additional global consequences, such as heightened risks of cyberattacks. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by the negative global and economic impact resulting from the conflict in Ukraine or any other geopolitical tensions.” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Human Capital
To ensure that the Company is well positioned to provide innovative system solutions and reliable services in a safe, efficient and responsible manner, the Company seeks to employ and retain a team of highly dedicated and accomplished people who genuinely care about the success of the Company. Creating an engaging workplace environment that provides for competitive 
pay and benefits, attractive career development opportunities, and a collaborative, respectful culture further enables the Company to achieve continued success.
Employees. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately 1,500 employees, including approximately 400 full-time salaried employees, comprised of project managers, estimators, superintendents and engineers who manage crews in its construction business and office staff. The Company also had approximately 1,100 craft employees, some of whom are represented by various labor unions. The Company believes it has a good relationship with its employees and has developed several strong partnerships with local unions to have access to an experienced, talented craft workforce. 
Core Values and Core Purpose. From the technician in the field to the leadership of its business, the Company focuses on caring for people. The Company’s core purpose “is to create great opportunities for people.” The Company has implemented internal development programs, which allow it to attract and retain talent and emphasize the importance of promoting from within. The Company believes its core values reflect who it is. The Company cares about its people and believes its approach provides a competitive advantage. The Company believes it has strong employee retention rates as a result of its ability to hire, develop and retain top industry talent.
The Company’s culture is driven by its Core Values:
•We CARE
•We Act with INTEGRITY
•We Are INNOVATIVE
•We Are ACCOUNTABLE
The Company believes each employee is essential to its continued success and the Company seeks to provide every employee with the foundation and environment needed to achieve the employee’s goals. This objective begins with the Company's commitment to diversity and inclusion. We CARE, one of the Company’s Core Values, is the foundation of its efforts to create a diverse, fair and inclusive organization. Building a culture where all of its employees feel a sense of belonging is important to the Company. 
In addition, the Company screens leadership hires and measures employee performance against these Core Values, and regularly measures employee engagement against these values through the Company’s annual employee engagement survey. The Company’s “We Care” survey, which has been issued for the past 15+ years, provides leadership with insights, including constructive ideas on how to improve the overall business for those who work for it.
Training and Employee Development. Investment in continuous learning is essential to providing industry-leading expertise and service to our customers, continuous improvement across our organization, and meaningful career development opportunities for our people. From in-person to online courses, formalized and other specialized training, our employees benefit from opportunities to strengthen their leadership and management competencies, improve communication and interpersonal skills, and advance their technical proficiency. Our people have access to resources that include a robust learning management system that provides company-wide access for employees to a number of online learning modules and support tools. As a result of our efforts, in February 2023, the Company was recognized as one of the top training organizations in the world earning a 2023 Training APEX Award presented by Training magazine.
Diversity and Inclusion. The Company is committed to creating and supporting a diverse, fair and inclusive environment for its employees, We Care culture, and industry as a whole. The Company believes that a diverse workforce is important to the long-term success of its business. The Company actively seeks to increase the diversity of its workforce and to practice its commitment to diversity and inclusion in hiring, development, and training, which extends to its senior leadership and Board of Directors. The Company understands that diversity is truly a competitive advantage that helps drive growth and innovation, and it has increasingly focused on diversity and inclusion programs within the Company.
Embrace Forum. The Company formed the Embrace Forum to continue to evolve its commitment to a culture of diversity and inclusion. This forum is composed of employees and leaders across the company who have made it their mission to maximize the potential of the Company’s employees by creating great opportunities through a diverse, fair and inclusive environment. The Embrace Forum focuses on several core areas: recruitment, development, promotion and employee resource groups (“ERGs”). 
The Company offers its employees the opportunity to join ERGs. These groups foster professional development, social connectivity, and celebrate diversity throughout the Company. Each year, new ERGs are evaluated for consideration. Currently, there are two active ERGs at the Company:
•Women in Construction and Service (“WICS”). The Company is committed to diversifying its workforce, promoting and supporting women within its organization to take on leadership roles, and helping encourage other women to join its industry as a whole. To support this initiative, the Company created the WICS ERG with a vision to create a culturally agile community that respects and empowers women in its company and industry.
•Unidos. Unidos is an ERG that was created to promote, empower and amplify the Hispanic culture within the Company. The mission of this ERG is to create a supportive environment for Hispanic employees and provide a more diverse and inclusive environment where everyone feels safe, respected and valued.
In addition, to help recruit the next generation of diverse industry leaders, the Company is actively involved with the ACE Mentor Program of America, Inc. (“ACE”). ACE helps mentor high school students and inspires them to pursue careers in design and construction. It is the construction industry’s fastest-growing high school mentoring program, reaching over 8,000 students annually.
Benefits & Wellness. The Company focuses on the most crucial component for its success: its people. The Company appreciates the fact that it owes its century-old existence to employees who work hard to help the Company prosper.
As such, the Company has committed itself to the health, safety and well-being of its workers and their families. One of the ways the Company shows its commitment is through offering competitive employee compensation and benefits packages, specifically designed to meet the unique needs of each individual in its organization, which include:
•Health and Welfare Plans. All full-time employees who do not participate in union plans are offered a range of choices among medical, dental and vision plans, life, accident, dependent and disability insurance, and pre-tax health spending accounts that include employer contributions.
•Retirement Savings. The Company helps provide its employees with financial security by offering a 401(k) Savings Plan, which includes company matching contributions, and an Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
•Employee Assistance Programs. Through the Company’s Employee Assistance Program, it offers its employees, and their dependents or household members, access to services and counseling on a variety of personal, professional, legal, and financial matters, at no cost.
•Wellness Program. Consists of various activities and financial incentives intended to inspire the Company’s team towards healthy living through personal accountability. 
Safety Culture. Safety is integral to the Company’s unique culture and Core Values. The Company cares about its employees and their families, and it holds each other accountable for working safely. The Company’s safety culture is based on its “Hearts and Minds Commitment to Safety” program, established in 2013 by senior staff and field professionals via its Hearts and Minds Forum. The Company’s Hearts & Minds program asks its employees to take direct responsibility for eliminating and preventing all incidents and injuries at home and in the workplace, which is done by:
•Hiring the Right People. The Company is focused on hiring qualified employees who share in its Core Values.
•Knowing the Details. Performed through thorough planning and having acute awareness of present surroundings, which aids in executing work safely.

This program helped earn the Company’s Ohio business unit the highest honor for which Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) can name a company; OSHA-Voluntary Protection Programs Star Site. This was the first time a union mechanical contractor has earned such an honor in the United States. The Company strives to achieve this honor at its other business units. 
In the February 2020 issue of Safety+Health Magazine, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Charles A. Bacon, III, was recognized by the National Safety Council as one of nine CEOs who “Get It.” Peers, building owners, and safety professionals recognize the Company as a leader and innovator in safety culture and process. The Company has received a myriad of awards and recognition for its safety programs and processes regionally and nationally. “We Care” goes beyond a statement, it is the core of the Company’s culture. 
Seasonality
Severe weather can impact the Company’s operations. In the northern climates where it operates, and to a lesser extent the southern climates as well, severe winters can slow the Company’s productivity on construction projects, which shifts revenue and gross profit recognition to a later period. The Company’s maintenance operations may also be impacted by mild or severe weather. Mild weather tends to reduce demand for the Company’s maintenance services, whereas severe weather may increase the demand for its maintenance and time-and-materials services.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption and volatility on a global scale resulting in, among other things, an economic slowdown, impacts to global supply chains, and the possibility of a continued economic recession. In limited instances, during fiscal 2020, the Company faced disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic as certain projects chose to shutdown work irrespective of the existence or applicability of government action. In most markets, construction was considered an essential business and the Company continued to staff its projects and perform work during fiscal 2020 and into 2021, and most of the projects that were in progress at the time that the shutdowns commenced were restarted. 
As new variants of the virus emerge, the Company remains cautious as many factors remain unpredictable. The Company actively monitors and responds to the changing conditions created by the pandemic, with focus on prioritizing the health and safety of the Company’s employees, dedicating resources to support the Company’s communities, and innovating to address the Company’s customers’ needs. During 2021, the Company faced impacts of both the Delta and Omicron variants, with disruptions to the Company’s workforce, which impacted revenue.
Although the Company continues to recover from the financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government orders implemented to mitigate it, the broader and longer-term implications the pandemic has on the global economy continue to develop. Economic disruptions, including supply chain, production, and other logistical issues, as well as escalating commodity prices, have and may continue to negatively impact our business. For example, we are experiencing lead times significantly in excess of normal levels while also experiencing the effects of inflation through increases in fuel, material, and other commodity prices. These disruptions have escalated in 2022 and have manifested themselves most notably through project delays and reduced labor productivity and efficiency, particularly within our GCR segment. In response to these challenges, the Company continues to strive to more effectively manage its business through enhanced labor planning and project scheduling, increased pricing to the extent contractually permitted, and by leveraging the Company's relationships with its suppliers and customers. However, the impact of these disruptions continues to evolve and the conflict in Ukraine has added another layer of uncertainty. There can be no assurance that the Company's actions will serve to mitigate such impacts in future periods. Further, while the Company believes its remaining performance obligations are firm, and its customers have not provided the Company with indications that they no longer wish to proceed with planned projects, prolonged delays in the receipt of critical equipment could result in the Company's customers seeking to terminate existing or pending agreements. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.
The Company continues to monitor developments involving our workforce, customers, suppliers and vendors and take steps to mitigate against additional impacts, but given the unprecedented and evolving nature of these circumstances, it cannot predict the full extent of the impact that the economic disruptions caused by COVID-19 will have on the Company's operating results, financial condition and liquidity.
Government and Environmental Regulations
The Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, including those relating to discharges to air, water and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, the handling of underground storage tanks and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances. The Company also is subject to compliance with numerous other laws and regulations of federal, state, local agencies, and authorities, including those relating to workplace safety, wage and hour, and other labor issues (including the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state laws), immigration controls, vehicle and equipment operations and other aspects of its business. In addition, a relatively limited number of the Company’s construction contracts are entered into with public authorities, and these contracts frequently impose additional requirements, including requirements regarding labor relations and subcontracting with designated classes of disadvantaged businesses. A large portion of the Company’s business uses labor that is provided under collective bargaining agreements. As such, the Company is subject to federal laws and regulations related to unionized labor and collective bargaining (including the National Labor Relations Act).
The Company continually monitors its compliance with these laws, regulations and other requirements. While compliance with existing laws, regulations and other requirements has not materially adversely affected the Company’s operations in the past, 
and it is not aware of any proposed requirements that the Company anticipates will have a material impact on its operations, there can be no assurance that these requirements will not change or that compliance will not otherwise adversely affect the Company’s operations in the future. In addition, while the Company typically passes any costs of compliance on to its customers under the applicable project agreement, either directly or as part of its estimate depending on the type of contract, there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur compliance expenses in the future that materially adversely affect its results of operations. Furthermore, certain environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non-compliance and other laws, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), and comparable state laws, impose strict, retroactive, joint and several liability upon persons that contribute to the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site.
Climate Change and Sustainability
The Company recognizes its environmental and societal responsibilities and is committed to sustainability and to improving its environmental footprint as well as operating its business in a manner that seeks to protect the health and safety of the Company’s employees and customers, as well as the public. The Company’s focus on environmental stewardship and improving productivity drives not only its efforts to become more energy efficient but also improvements in the Company’s customers' impact on climate change. Replacing an aging building’s existing systems with modern, energy-efficient systems significantly reduces a building’s energy consumption and carbon footprint while improving cost, air quality, and overall system effectiveness.
The Company is subject to the requirements of numerous federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and rules that promote the protection of the environment. While capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not currently anticipate that they will have a material effect on its capital expenditures or competitive position in the short term.
