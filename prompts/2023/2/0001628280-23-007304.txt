ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
Our Company 
Stabilis Solutions, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”, “Stabilis”, “our”, “us” or “we”) is an energy transition company that provides turnkey clean energy production, storage, transportation and fueling solutions primarily using liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) to multiple end markets. We have safely delivered over 420 million gallons of LNG through more than 43,000 truck deliveries during our 18-year operating history, which we believe makes us one of the largest and most experienced small-scale LNG providers in North America. We define “small-scale” LNG production to include liquefiers that produce less than 1.0 million LNG gallons per day and “small-scale” LNG distribution to include distribution by trailer or tank container up to 10,000 LNG gallons or marine vessels that carry less than 8.0 million LNG gallons (30,000 cubic meters of LNG). The Company provides LNG solutions to customers in diverse end markets, including aerospace, agriculture, energy, industrial, marine bunkering, mining, pipeline, remote power and utility markets.
The Company also builds power and control systems for the energy industry in China through its 40% owned Chinese joint venture, BOMAY Electric Industries, Inc (“BOMAY”). BOMAY is accounted for as an equity investment.
Our Industry 
LNG can be used to deliver natural gas to locations where pipeline service is unavailable, has been interrupted, or needs to be supplemented. LNG can also be used to replace a variety of alternative fuels, including distillate fuel oil and propane, among others, to provide environmental and economic benefits. Increasingly, LNG is being utilized as a transportation fuel in the marine industry and as a propellant in the private rocket launch sector. We believe that these fuel markets are large and provide significant opportunities for LNG usage.
We believe that LNG as well as other clean energy solutions will provide an important balance between environmental sustainability, security and accessibility, and economic viability when compared to both renewables and other traditional hydrocarbon-based fuels and will play a key role in the energy transition.
OUR BUSINESS
The Company generates revenue by selling and delivering LNG to our customers, renting cryogenic equipment and providing engineering and field support services. We sell our products and services separately or as a bundle depending on the customer’s needs. Pricing depends on market pricing for natural gas and competing fuel sources (such as diesel, fuel oil, and propane among others), as well as the customer’s purchased volume, contract duration and credit profile. 
LNG Production and Sales—Stabilis builds and operates cryogenic natural gas processing facilities, called “liquefiers,” which convert natural gas into LNG through a purification and multiple stage cooling process. We currently own and operate a liquefier that can produce up to 100,000 LNG gallons per day in George West, Texas and a liquefier that can produce up to 30,000 LNG gallons per day in Port Allen, Louisiana. We also purchase LNG from third-party production sources which allows us to support customers in markets where we do not own liquefiers. We make the determination of LNG and transportation supply sources based on the cost of LNG, the transportation cost to deliver to regional customer locations, and the reliability of the supply source.
Transportation and Logistics Services—Stabilis offers its customers a “virtual natural gas pipeline” by providing turnkey LNG transportation and logistics services in North America. We deliver LNG to our customers’ work sites from both our own production facilities and our network of approximately 30 third-party production sources located throughout North America. We own a fleet of cryogenic trailers to transport and deliver LNG. We also outsource similar equipment and transportation services for LNG from qualified third-party providers as required to support our customer base. 
Cryogenic Equipment Rental—Stabilis operates a fleet of approximately 205 mobile LNG storage and vaporization assets, including: transportation trailers, electric and gas-fired vaporizers, ambient vaporizers, storage tanks, and mobile vehicle fuelers. We also own several stationary storage and regasification assets. We believe this is one of the largest fleets of small-scale LNG equipment in North America. Our fleet consists primarily of trailer-mounted mobile assets, making delivery to and between customer locations more efficient. We deploy these assets on job sites to provide our customers with the equipment required to transport, store, and consume LNG in their fueling operations. Our equipment is designed specifically for use in small-scale LNG applications and includes the safety and operational features that our customers and our regulators require.
Engineering and Field Support Services—Stabilis has experience in the safe, cost effective, and reliable use of LNG in multiple customer applications. We have also developed many processes and procedures that we believe improve our customers’ use of LNG in their operations. Our engineers help our customers design and integrate LNG into their fueling operations and our field service technicians help our customers mobilize, commission and reliably operate on the job site.
Stabilis believes that our extensive operating experience positions us to be a leader in the North American small-scale LNG markets. We plan to leverage this experience to grow our business by investing in new production and distribution assets throughout North America.
Market for Small-Scale LNG in North America 
LNG can serve as a partner fuel for renewable energy sources and provides an important balance between environmental sustainability, security and access, and economic viability as a source of fuel. LNG can also be used to deliver natural gas to locations where pipeline service is unavailable, has been interrupted, or needs to be supplemented and to replace a variety of other carbon-based fuels. We believe that the current and future markets for LNG are significant and will continue to grow for a number of years. 
We believe that the following factors could drive significant small-scale LNG market growth in North America over the next decade:
New and Expanding Markets for LNG such as Marine Bunkering and Rocket Propulsion. Demand for LNG as a marine fuel continues to grow. While LNG bunkering infrastructure is more developed in other regions such as Europe, there is limited LNG bunkering infrastructure currently available in the U.S. The marine industry is expected to drive additional demand for domestically produced LNG in the coming years. Additionally, liquefied methane is increasingly becoming the fuel of choice for reusable rocket propulsion systems due to its higher energy density, reduced risk of explosion and ease and cost to produce. The commercial satellite industry is expected to drive a significant increase in launches and demand for liquid methane in the form of LNG to support this growth.
Lower Emissions than Alternative Fossil Fuels. Natural gas contains less carbon than most other fossil fuels and, as a result, produces fewer carbon dioxide emissions when burned. The National Energy Technology Laboratory indicates that new natural gas power plants emit between 50% and 60% less carbon dioxide compared with emissions from a typical coal plant. The Argonne National Laboratory indicates that natural gas vehicles produce between 13% and 21% fewer greenhouse gas emissions than comparable gasoline and diesel fueled vehicles. Additional studies indicate that natural gas also produces lower particulate matter and sulfur emissions than other fossil fuels. We believe the relative environmental benefits of natural gas as a fuel is becoming increasingly important as our customers expand their corporate sustainability mandates to lower greenhouse gas emissions and increase decarbonization initiatives. 
Less Expensive than Other Traditional Fuels. The cost of natural gas compared to other energy sources is a significant driver for the future demand for natural gas and LNG. Technological advances in natural gas production have unlocked significant new gas reserves in North America. We believe that these proven, abundant and growing reserves of natural gas have the potential to produce among the highest volumes of natural gas in the world. This abundant supply of natural gas has supported relatively low natural gas prices in North America. The cost of natural gas in the United States and Canada currently is less than the cost of crude oil on an energy equivalent basis. In addition, because the price of the natural gas commodity makes up a smaller portion of the total cost of LNG relative to the commodity portion of competing fuels, the price of LNG is less sensitive to variations in the underlying commodity cost. These factors have made LNG more economical than competing fuel sources, and we believe that LNG will maintain this cost advantage into the foreseeable future. 
The following chart illustrates the lower cost and decreased price sensitivity of LNG by comparing the historical wholesale price of Propane, Ultra-Low No. 2 Diesel, Indicative Liquefied Natural Gas and Natural Gas (Henry Hub). 
ULSD, Propane & LNG pricing- December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2022
Better Safety than Alternative Fuels. The physical characteristics of LNG make it a safer and more environmentally friendly fuel when compared to diesel and propane because it boils and dissipates rapidly into the air when spilled instead of pooling on or near the ground. If released, LNG is also less combustible than diesel and propane because it ignites at relatively high temperatures and within a narrow flammability range when mixed with air. In addition, LNG fuel tanks and systems used in natural gas applications are subjected to a number of federal and state required safety tests, such as fire, environmental hazard, burst pressure and crash testing that ensure their safety. 
Established LNG Production and Distribution Technology. Small-scale LNG production and distribution technologies have been proven and are now widely available from multiple vendors. Small-scale liquefiers are available in modular formats from several vendors and many of them have established track records of reliable and safe operating performance. LNG transport trailers, storage vessels, and vaporization equipment are also available from multiple vendors, and most of this equipment also comes with an established operating track record. We believe that the availability of proven small-scale LNG production and distribution technologies reduces the technology risk in growing the industry, but it also places a premium on the owner’s or operator’s construction and operating capabilities. 
Our Customers 
Stabilis serves customers in a variety of end markets, including aerospace, agriculture, energy, industrial, marine bunkering, mining, pipeline, remote power and utility markets within North America. We believe these customer markets are well suited to use LNG because they consume relatively high volumes of fuel, operate in mobile, temporary or off-pipeline locations, have limited access to alternative fuel sources, and/or are facing increasingly stringent emissions or other environmental requirements. We currently serve approximately 50 customers. For the year ended December 31, 2022, Aggreko Plc and Minera Penmont each accounted for more than 10% of our revenues. During such period, no other purchaser accounted for 10% or more of our revenue.
Aerospace. The Aerospace industry utilizes LNG as a propellant for rocket propulsion systems and LNG provides an economical, clean burning, and easily stored fuel for rockets engines. Aerospace firms may also utilize LNG for power generation at remote facilities. Consumption of LNG at aerospace facilities vary significantly by project type.
Agriculture. The Agriculture industry utilizes LNG to power high horsepower engines and also when food processing utilizes heat such as in drying operations as LNG has a clean and consistent burn that makes heating operations more predictable. 
Energy. Energy producers use high horsepower engines to power their drilling and pressure pumping operations. LNG displaces some of the total diesel fuel consumption in these applications using dual-fuel engine technology. We believe that energy producers can use LNG to reduce fuel costs and to meet environmental emissions requirements. Based on our experience, dual-fuel drill rigs can consume 1,000 to 5,000 LNG gallons per day and dual-fuel pressure pumping spreads can consume 10,000 to 20,000 LNG gallons per day. Energy producers use the field gas being produced in their operations to fuel the turbine engines that power their pressure pumping spreads. While turbines can burn field gas, they often require significant amounts of LNG for primary or back-up fuel supply because field gas often varies widely in volume, composition, and pressure. Based on our experience, turbine driven pressure pumping operations can consume 30,000 to 60,000 LNG gallons per day when using LNG as the primary fuel.
Industrial. Industrial applications for LNG include sand and aggregate producers, asphalt plants, greenhouses, food processers, paper mills, agricultural dryers, and general manufacturing facilities. Remote sand producers and mobile asphalt plants that use LNG to produce heat for their processing and drying operation are among our largest customers. LNG often replaces propane, fuel oil, or diesel fuel in these applications. These customers often cannot justify the cost of new pipeline infrastructure and using LNG requires minimal up-front costs, regulatory approvals, and lead time requirements. We believe LNG is optimal for these applications because it is cost-effective with stable pricing, offers consistent supply without curtailments, provides an energy density that minimizes storage requirements, and has a clean and consistent burn that makes heating operations more predictable. Based on our experience, sand production facilities can consume 10,000 to 20,000 LNG gallons per day, and asphalt plants can use 5,000 to 10,000 LNG gallons per day.
Marine Bunkering of LNG. We believe that opportunities to provide LNG as a fuel source to the marine transportation industry represents a significant opportunity for us. As shipping and marine transportation companies expand the use of LNG as a fuel source, we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on future growth. The International Maritime Organization (“IMO”) has imposed a global sulfur cap of 0.5% on ships trading outside of established emission control areas starting in January 2020, a level that could be difficult to achieve using common marine fuels, such as heavy fuel oil, but could be achieved using LNG. Large marine vessels can take several hundred thousand gallons of LNG in a single fuel bunkering event.
Mining. Mines, including those producing metals, rare earth materials, and coal, are often located in remote locations that are off the electrical grid and do not have natural gas pipeline access. Mines use LNG to fuel electrical generators and to produce heat for their processing activities. Several mines have also tested using LNG as a fuel for their mine trucks and other high horsepower engine equipment. In addition to fuel cost benefits, LNG can help reduce emissions at mines that are often located in environmentally sensitive areas. Based on our experience, power generation and heating applications at mines can consume 10,000 to 100,000 LNG gallons per day. 
Pipeline and Utilities. LNG usage in utility and pipeline applications varies by project type. North America has an expansive network of pipelines that, based on age and increasingly more stringent regulations, require routine testing and maintenance. During such events LNG fueling solutions can provide flow assurance to address natural gas supply interruptions during pipeline hydrostatic testing, repairs, gas distribution system curtailments, or unplanned outages. Such solutions can also provide a bridge for large industrial or utility customers before permanent pipelines are installed. LNG is becoming more predominant in regions where natural gas demand is growing and utilities and pipelines are required to continue to meet critical peak gas demand. LNG can provide an economic solution to support these supply requirements during peak weather conditions, gas curtailments and/or pipeline repairs. In addition, utilities and other power providers can also utilize LNG to provide clean distributed power when access to an electrical grid is limited, additional power is needed during times of peak load, or power infrastructure is damaged due to storms such as hurricanes or wildfires. 
China. Through our 40% interest in BOMAY, we provide power and control systems for the land drilling and production market in China.
Competitive Strengths 
Stabilis believes that we are well positioned to execute our business strategies based on the following competitive strengths: 
LNG is an economically and environmentally attractive product. Stabilis believes that many of our customers use LNG because it can significantly reduce harmful carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, sulfur, particulate matter, and other emissions as compared to other hydrocarbon-based fuels. LNG is also an important partner fuel for renewables such as solar and wind power 
and will be a key component of the energy transition to more sustainable sources of energy. We also believe that the combination of cost and environmental benefits makes LNG a compelling fuel source for many energy consumers. We believe that LNG can be delivered to customers at prices that are lower and more stable than what they would pay for distillate fuels or propane. In addition, several of our customers have reported that LNG as a fuel decreases their operating costs by reducing equipment maintenance requirements and providing more consistent burn characteristics.
Demonstrated ability to execute LNG projects safely and cost effectively. Stabilis has produced and delivered over 420 million gallons of LNG to our customers throughout our 18-year operating history. Our experience includes building and operating LNG production facilities, delivering LNG from third-party sources to our customers, and designing and executing a wide-variety of turnkey LNG fueling solutions for our customers using our cryogenic equipment fleet supported by our field service team. We have experience serving customers in multiple end markets including aerospace, industrial, utilities and pipelines, mining, energy, remote clean power, and transportation. We also have experience exporting LNG to Mexico and Canada. Finally, we believe our team is among the most experienced in the small-scale LNG industry. We believe that we can leverage this proven LNG execution experience to grow our business in existing markets and expand our business into new markets. 
Comprehensive provider of “virtual natural gas pipeline” solutions throughout North America. Stabilis offers our customers a comprehensive off-pipeline natural gas solution by providing the supply infrastructure, transportation and logistics, and field service support necessary to deliver LNG to them in a program that is tailored to their consumption needs. We believe we own one of the largest fleets of cryogenic transportation, storage, and vaporization equipment in North America. We can provide our customers LNG and related services for a wide variety of applications almost anywhere in the United States, Canada and Mexico. We believe that our ability to be a “one stop shop” for all of our customers’ off-pipeline natural gas requirements throughout North America is unique among LNG providers. 
Ability to leverage existing LNG production and delivery capabilities into new markets. Stabilis believes that our experience producing and distributing LNG can be leveraged to grow into new geographic and service end markets. Since our founding we have expanded our service area across the United States, northern Mexico, and western Canada. We have also expanded our industry coverage to include multiple new end markets and customers. We accomplished this expansion into new markets by leveraging our LNG production and distribution expertise, in combination with our cryogenic engineering and project development capabilities, to meet new customer needs. 
Competition 
The market for natural gas is highly competitive and we have multiple competitors for natural gas fuel. Stabilis believes the biggest competition for LNG in these applications are distillate fuels and propane as they power the majority of engines and generators in our target markets. We also compete with other fuel sources including pipeline natural gas and compressed natural gas ("CNG"). 
Stabilis competes with other natural gas companies, as well as other fossil fuel sources, based on a variety of factors, including, among others, cost, supply, availability, quality, emissions, and safety of the fuel. Location is often a primary competitive factor as transportation costs limit the distance LNG can be hauled at competitive prices. We believe we compare favorably with many of our competitors on the basis of these factors. However, some of our competitors have longer operating histories and market-based experience, larger customer bases, more expansive brand recognition, deeper market penetration and substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than our business. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to changes in customer preferences, legal requirements or other industry or regulatory trends, devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, dedicate more effort to infrastructure and systems development in support of their business or product development activities and exert more influence on the regulatory landscape that impacts the natural gas fuel market. Additionally, utilities and their affiliates typically have unique competitive advantages, including a lower cost of capital, substantial and predictable cash flows, long-standing customer relationships, greater brand awareness, and large sales and marketing organizations. 
Stabilis does not believe that we compete with mid-scale and world-scale LNG liquefiers that produce more than 1,000,000 LNG gallons per day. These large LNG production facilities typically are designed and permitted to fill large marine vessels that deliver cargos of 26.5 million LNG gallons or more to large import terminals in foreign markets. We do not believe that any of them currently have or plan to have truck loading facilities that would be required to supply LNG to small-scale LNG customers. We also do not believe that any mid-scale or large-scale liquefiers currently have plans to install LNG loading capabilities for marine vessels smaller than 7.9 million LNG gallons. 
Sales and Marketing 
Stabilis markets our products and services primarily through our direct sales force, which includes sales representatives covering all of our major geographic and customer markets, as well as attendance at trade shows and participation in industry conferences and events. Our technical, sales and marketing teams also work closely with federal, state and local government agencies to provide education about the value of natural gas as a fuel and to keep abreast of proposed and newly adopted regulations that affect our industry. 
Seasonality 
We did not experience significant seasonal variations in volume of LNG delivered to our customers during 2022, and we do not expect future volumes to be significantly impacted by seasonal variations. However, our revenues are susceptible to variations due to changes in the price of natural gas as we pass this cost onto our customer. The price of natural gas can fluctuate at any time during the year due to isolated factors, but on average, natural gas prices tend to be higher in peak winter and peak summer months when heating and cooling demand is seasonally higher. 
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters 
Stabilis is subject to a variety of federal, international, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety, labor and employment, building codes and construction, zoning and land use, public reporting and taxation, among others. Any changes to existing laws or regulations, the adoption of new laws or regulations, or failure by us to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in significant additional expense to us or our customers or a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. Regulations that significantly affect our operating activities are described below. Compliance with these regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position to date, but new laws or regulations or amendments to existing laws or regulations to make them more stringent could have such an effect in the future. We cannot estimate the costs that may be required for us to comply with potential new laws or changes to existing laws, and these unknown costs are not contemplated by our existing customer agreements or our budgets and cost estimates. We believe that we are in compliance with all environmental and other governmental regulations. Our compliance has, to date, had no material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.
Construction and Operation of LNG Liquefaction Plants. To build and operate LNG liquefaction plants, Stabilis must apply for facility permits or licenses that address many factors, including storm water and wastewater discharges, waste handling, and air emissions related to production activities and equipment operation. The construction of LNG plants must also be approved by local planning boards and fire departments. 
Transportation of LNG. Federal and state safety standards require that LNG is moved by qualified drivers in cryogenic containers designed for LNG transportation. Drivers are subject to U.S. Department of Transportation (“USDOT”) regulations, such as Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”), Hazardous Materials Regulations, and state certification requirements, such as certifications by the Alternative Energy Division of the Railroad Commission of Texas. Cryogenic containers have to undergo annual USDOT visual inspections and periodic pressure tests. Motor vehicles equipped with an LNG container or other motor vehicles used principally for transporting LNG in portable containers in Texas have to be registered with the Railroad Commission of Texas. 
Transfer of LNG. Transfer of LNG occurs between transport trailers, permanent and temporary facilities as well as marine facilities and vessels. Marine transfers can occur on the shore side to or from a vessel or from vessel to vessel. International, Federal, State and local safety standards and operational regulations require the transfer of LNG, hydrogen, CNG and other fuels to be conducted in accordance with specific written safety standards and operational procedures. These procedures require that trained, qualified personnel be in attendance and manage all transfer operations. These procedures must be implemented at each transfer site location and copies of the procedures be available to site personnel. Minimum safety signage that meets governing regulations must be displayed and visible at each site and on appropriate equipment.
Storage and Vaporization of LNG at Customer Sites. To install and operate both temporary and permanent storage and vaporization equipment, Stabilis may apply for permits or licenses that address many factors, including waste handling and air emissions related to onsite storage and equipment operation or consult with customers so they may apply for needed permits. The operation and siting of storage and vaporization of LNG may also require approval by local planning boards and fire departments. 
Import & Export of LNG. Stabilis has the ability to import or export LNG from the United States to Mexico and Canada via truck. In support of our business in Mexico, we maintain an export license from the United States Department of Energy (“DOE”) and maintain import permits to bring the LNG into the country. In support of our business in Canada, Stabilis maintains an import and export license from the “DOE” and from the National Energy Board of Canada (“NEB”). We also maintain an Emergency Response Action Plan (“ERAP”) with Transport Canada. 
During the third quarter of 2022, Stabilis received authorization from the DOE to export domestically produced LNG to all free trade and non-free trade countries, including Asian, European, and Latin American importing nations for up to 51.75 billion cubic feet per year. The authorization is for a term of 28 years. Stabilis has not made any exports under this approval during the year ended December 31, 2022. 
Human Capital Resources 
Stabilis believes that one of its key assets is the collective expertise, experience and diversity of its workforce. The Company depends on all of its employees, including its executive officers and senior management, to successfully operate its businesses and to successfully execute its strategy going forward. As of December 31, 2022, Stabilis had 100 employees, 99 of whom were full-time employees. We believe our relations with employees are satisfactory. None of our employees are currently subject to a collective bargaining agreement. 
Stabilis seeks to attract and retain its employees by offering competitive compensation packages including base and incentive compensation, attractive benefits and opportunities for advancement and rewarding careers. The Company periodically reviews and adjusts, if needed, its employees’ compensation to ensure that it is competitive within the industry and is consistent with their level of performance. Stabilis considers employee benefits to be an important part of employee total compensation. For this reason, the Company’s benefits include medical, dental, and vision and insurance, short- and long-term disability insurance, accidental death and disability insurance, travel and accident insurance, as well as a 401(k) contribution retirement plan. The Company’s ability to attract employees is also significantly influenced by our efforts to create a culture founded on opportunity, personal growth, respect, collaboration and its ability to value the diverse backgrounds, skills and contributions that its employees offer.
Stabilis strives to provide its people with all of the tools and support necessary for them to succeed and safely perform their duties. The safety of its employees, contractors, customers and communities is paramount to the Company’s success. To ensure safe, reliable and efficient operations in a highly regulated environment, the Company supports and utilizes various employee training, educational programs as well as safety programs with detailed safety and health related procedures that all are required to follow.
