Item 1. Business. 
Introduction 
 
Sonim Technologies, Inc. was incorporated in the state of Delaware on August 5, 1999 and is headquartered in San Diego, California. Unless otherwise indicated, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “Company” and “Sonim” refer to Sonim Technologies, Inc. and its wholly owned and consolidated subsidiaries.
Overview
 
We are a leading provider of rugged and consumer durable mobile devices including phones and accessories designed to provide extra protection for users that demand more durability in their work and everyday lives. In 2022, we introduced a tablet product that has generated a significant portion of the Company’s revenue since its introduction. This new product has a large screen that allows customers to easily access and process IoT data. It allows the Company to gain experience with data devices and diversifies the Company’s portfolio. The Company is developing additional data devices to further diversify the Company’s portfolio.
 
We currently have device placements in the three largest wireless carriers in the United States - ATT, Verizon and T-Mobile – as well as the three largest wireless carriers in Canada – Bell, Telus and Rogers. While we primarily sell through the wireless carrier channel, we also sell through distribution channels in North America and Europe. Our tablets are sold unbranded, and are imported by our customer to the U.S., for sale in the U.S. Our devices and accessories connect users with voice, data, workflow and lifestyle applications that enhance the user experience while providing an extra level of protection.
 
Task workers in the Enterprise and Government sectors have historically been limited to pen and paper, older radio technology and/or single-purpose electronic devices, such as barcode scanners, location-tracking devices and sensors, to accomplish specific tasks. These single-purpose devices have historically operated on proprietary networks, such as Land Mobile Radio 94 or LMR networks that enable Push-to-Talk or PTT services for voice communications. We provide communication devices that consolidate and integrate multiple functions including PTT, into a single ruggedized solution running on commercial wireless networks at a total cost of ownership that we believe is significantly lower than other solutions and that provides improved productivity and safety of task workers.
 
Our solutions include ultra-rugged mobile phones that are capable of attaching to both public and private wireless networks, industrial-grade accessories that meet the requirements of specific applications, and software applications and cloud-based tools that provide management and deployment services to our customers. We tightly integrate PTT capabilities into both the hardware and software of our mobile phones, including a dedicated hard key that can initiate a PTT call even if the phone is in a sleep-state. End customers of our solutions include construction, energy and utility, hospitality, logistics, manufacturing, public sector and transportation entities that primarily purchase our devices and accessories through their wireless carriers. The key attributes of our solutions are specifically tailored for the needs of our end users, including impact resistance, waterproof, chemical resistant, and dustproof construction, extended battery life and extra loud audio, supported by a three-year comprehensive warranty. All of our devices run on the Android operating system, providing a familiar and intuitive user interface, and our smartphones have access to a library of millions of applications available through the Google Play Store. We have also implemented dozens of application programming interfaces, or APIs, specific to our mobile phones and have partnered with third-party application developers to create a purpose-built experience for our end users using these applications on our mobile phones. This includes working with the leading providers of PTT and mission-critical-PTT, or MCPTT applications to deliver a seamless instant communications experience.
 
We currently have stocked phone and accessory products with the three largest U.S. wireless carriers: AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon, meaning that these carriers test and certify our mobile phones on their networks and maintain inventory in their warehouses that they then sell through their enterprise and retail sales teams to end customers, often on a subsidized or financed basis. Our full product portfolio has also been stocked with the three largest Canadian wireless carriers. In 2022, we sold approximately 25,000 mobile phones in Canada and 111,000 in the United States.
 
We enter into master sales arrangements with carriers (including channel partners contributing over 53% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022) under which our partners purchase our solutions for distribution on a purchase order basis. Under these arrangements, we and the channel partners determine sales channel distribution in connection with pricing (including any discounts and price protection) and market positioning of each particular mobile phone product. We also offer our channel partners channel marketing and other promotional incentives, such as sales volume incentives, in exchange for retail price reductions. We may also offer Non-Recurring Engineering, or NRE services in the form of third-party design services relating to the design of materials and software licenses used in the manufacturing of our products. In the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 83% and 76% respectively, of our revenues were derived from our top four customers. In 2022, 42% of our revenues were from our new tablet product that had only one customer. We expect our revenues to continue to be heavily concentrated among our top customers, and the loss of, or significant reduction in orders from, any of these customers could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely impact our operating result.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our revenue was $69.8 million and $54.6 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our net loss was $14.1 million and $38.6 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, revenues from our top four customers were $58 million and $42 million, respectively.

Our Industry
 
Communication, data collection, productivity and safety among task workers has always been a central requirement in business-critical and mission-critical environments. Organizations with remote and disparate workers—from police and firefighters to construction, oil rig, logistics and manufacturing workers—need an extremely durable solution that provides reliable and secure voice, data and workflow applications. Historically, task workers had limited options, and in many cases resorted to using pen and paper. In the 1930s, public safety organizations introduced LMR networks that enabled PTT services, allowing workers to instantly and reliably initiate communications. In the 1970s, proprietary bar code scanners and other proprietary single-purpose tools were introduced to assist task workers in accomplishing specific tasks. In addition, in the mid-1990s, Nextel’s iDEN service provided organizations the benefits of PTT without the upfront equipment and infrastructure investments required with LMR. The advent and proliferation of LTE and advancements in smartphone technologies led to the start of the decommissioning of the Nextel iDEN network in the United States by Sprint in 2013. These developments paved the way for commercial wireless carriers to deliver mobility solutions that enhance the speed, reliability and durability of those offered by traditional LMR networks and other proprietary devices and applications.
 
The global market for rugged devices continues to grow and we believe that the use of consumer phones in line-of-business applications provides an attractive market opportunity. Ruggedized mobile phones are well suited for industrial enterprise and other critical infrastructure applications due to their durability and functionality in a range of environments. Equipping workers with smarter mobile phones also helps enable more efficient communication with and between field employees and enhance the information that decision-makers use to deploy resources within their organizations. The PTT over cellular network market, such as rugged phones on LTE with integrated PTT functions, has been steadily growing, in part as a replacement for aging LMR systems. The migration of a large base of legacy Windows-based handheld devices to Android continues to be a growth driver for rugged devices.
 
The core Sonim business has always been in the rugged space. Nevertheless, as there have been changes in market dynamics recently given LG’s exit and the desire to move away from Chinese OEM’s, we are moving towards evolving our expertise in rugged handsets into a consumer durable line of products which will include 5G handsets as well as mobile hotspots and solutions for fixed wireless access. It is estimated that 87 million Americans have damaged their smartphones in the last 12 months. Sonim plans to bring our expertise in rugged design into the consumer arena with competitively priced, attractively designed consumer products that have the added benefit of durability to help prevent screen breakage and a higher level of water resistance (IPx ratings). The target market is price-conscious consumers that want more protection for their devices without the cost and look of a more rugged device.
 
A main component of our expansion strategy will be in the area of Connected Solutions which encompasses mobile hotspots and fixed wireless access solutions. With competition exiting the carrier space as well as non-competitively priced products in the market, Sonim believes that this space is a great opportunity for expansion. Sonim plans to address these segments with feature-rich devices that are competitively priced. The mobile hotspot segment has millions of LTE devices that customers will be upgrading to 5G as the cost of the devices becomes more affordable. The fixed wireless access segment is a greenfield opportunity for wireless operators to establish new revenue streams with their customers. It is in both of these areas that Sonim plans to gain market share.
 
In 2022, we introduced our tablet product that is responsible for 42% of our revenue in 2022. We will continue to sell tablets in 2023 and will develop additional products to diversify our portfolio.
 
Industrial Enterprise Market Opportunity
 
Within the industrial enterprise market, we primarily focus on providing our solutions for business-critical tasks. In the United States and Canada there are task workers across verticals in our industrial enterprise end market, including transportation and logistics, construction, manufacturing, facilities management and energy and utility, who could benefit from our products. The extreme durability, and enhanced voice and text communication capabilities of our devices, enable these workers to be stationed in remote and hazardous environments, while remaining connected to their central command center at all times.
 
The functionality and durability requirements for workers in the industrial enterprise market significantly differ from that provided by a consumer-focused mobile device. Our solutions provide enterprises with the ability to centrally manage, and control device functions and data stored on the phone remotely. Enterprises seeking to reduce their operating expenses by optimizing workflows can enhance their workers’ productivity by leveraging specialized, purpose-built rugged platforms with functions such as PTT, location tracking and extra-loud audio. These features are especially crucial for business-critical applications across the industrial enterprise.

Public Sector Market Opportunities
 
Historically, U.S. public safety agencies and other critical infrastructure entities like utilities and municipalities have utilized rugged two-way radios running on proprietary LMR networks to ensure reliable and immediate communication. As these closed networks were locally funded, built and controlled, they were designed not to be interoperable across cities and states and other agencies. Over time, these users have incrementally augmented their LMR radios with mobile devices running on commercial wireless networks. These mobile devices enabled public-safety officers to gather real-time information, collected across multiple systems, and to respond and react to changing circumstances.
 
On September 11, 2001, many firefighters perished in part due to the lack of interoperability between the LMR systems of the multiple responding agencies in New York City and surrounding areas. Additionally, commercial cellular communications were halted due to the significant increase in call volumes. Based on the 9/11 Commission Report’s recommendations, Congress passed legislation in 2012 to establish the First Responder Network Authority under the Department of Commerce, which was tasked with deploying a nationwide public safety broadband network.
 
In March 2017, the Department of Commerce and the First Responder Network Authority awarded AT&T a contract to build, maintain and operate a nationwide high-speed broadband network for public safety, or FirstNet, for 25 years. The contract provides AT&T with 20 MHz of spectrum and $7 billion in funding to support this network and established subscriber targets, milestone buildouts and disincentive fees to help ensure that AT&T fulfills its commitments to public safety. The contract also provides AT&T a 25-year lease of FirstNet Band 14 spectrum subject to AT&T enlisting a minimum number of emergency responders across the United States. As of December 2022, FirstNet (Built with AT&T) had signed approximately 24,000 public safety agencies, representing approximately 4.4 million FirstNet connections.
 
Due to AT&T’s focus on growing its number of public safety users, other major U.S. wireless carriers including T-Mobile and Verizon have been focused on establishing and defending their market positions, creating a highly competitive market for public safety users among the major U.S. wireless carriers.
 
We introduced our first devices that supported FirstNet, XP8 and XP5s, in the first quarter of 2018, and XP3 the second quarter of 2019. We launched the next generation of these three devices, the XP10 in the fourth quarter of 2022, the XP5plus in the second quarter of 2022, and the XP3plus in 2021. Through our partnerships with wireless carriers that provide FirstNet and similar networks, as well as wireless carriers seeking to obtain market share through other dedicated cellular networks, we believe we are in a strong position to provide our ruggedized solutions through these channel partners to the public safety market as these competing public safety networks mature. We intend to continue to leverage our access to end customers and end users on public safety networks to increase brand awareness and become the favored provider for ruggedized solutions across the public safety market generally. We believe that the general momentum to convert to cellular based systems from LMR, either dedicated or prioritized for public safety, is a global trend as Western European countries and Australia are considering similar wireless networks.
 
Consumer Durable Market
 
The combined mobile phone market between the U.S. and Canada is estimated to grow to 358 million users in 2023. While the majority of this market has been dominated by Apple and Samsung, there is still a need for more durable, lower cost options for more budget-conscious users. In the past this was usually accomplished by providing a durable case that was both an additional cost to the end consumer as well as adding bulk to the device for added protection. Additionally, consumers would need to sign up for costly service plans to replace cracked screens, the most common repair for smartphones. Sonim believes there is a significant opportunity to bring our expertise in ruggedized design to this market for a lower cost, more streamlined design that will provide added protection against cracked screens and water damage without the higher cost, service plans or bulk of a durable accessory. The target market for a consumer durable device is quite expansive. While we see this segment as a natural extension of our expertise in ultra-rugged devices, the devices are meant for consumers as a lower cost, high-value option with all the expected features of a consumer device and the added protection of key rugged features. Some examples include: a busy budget-conscious mom on the go, an avid hiker who is an outdoor enthusiast, and a task worker supervisor that doesn’t necessarily need an ultra-rugged device but needs something more durable that will not need to be constantly replaced for screen breaks due to the nature of their activities.

Connected Solutions Market
 
The combined mobile hotspot market in the U.S. and Canada is estimated to be 3.5 million new devices in 2023. This is split between LTE and 5G devices with most of the LTE devices being supplied by Asian suppliers and the 5G devices being supplied by U.S. suppliers. With some U.S. suppliers changing their corporate focus, there is a void in quality suppliers that are focused on the mobile hotspot market. There is also a shift in focus from the U.S. and Canadian operators with an effort to minimize the non-5G devices put onto their networks. Sonim believes that there is a significant opportunity to address this market with affordably priced products and take advantage of the LTE to 5G upgrade cycle. As 5G device costs continue to erode, the percentage of 5G devices should greatly increase compared to LTE devices.
 
The combined fixed wireless access market in the U.S. and Canada is estimated to be 4 to 5 million new devices in 2023. The vast majority of these devices are 5G. Mobile network operators are focused on this segment as one of the pillars to achieve new revenue streams from customers as the mobile phone market becomes more saturated. Most of the competition in this segment comes from Asian ODMs. This is a reflection of the economics needed to make their fixed wireless access business work. There is an opportunity for Sonim to provide a U.S.-based alternative that is at comparable prices. This will greatly ease the burden on operators to deal with Asian suppliers as well as to alleviate geopolitical risks.
 
Original Design Manufacturing (“ODM”) Business Model
 
Our new tablet products represent our entry into the ODM business. In this model, we identify a customer, design a product to meet their needs, outsource the production to a third-party partner, and manage the production and quality control of the product. We use our expertise and experience to efficiently and quickly develop new products that are designed based on a customer’s specifications. The model allows us to reduce our risk by preventing us from having to commit resources for the development, production, and the financing of the raw materials and inventory. We are able to efficiently scale production without committing additional resources. We expect to continue to sell products through this ODM model.

● | Ease of use. Our devices are designed to look and function similarly to the latest generation of consumer-focused mobile phones with additional features for various enterprise-specific purposes, and also run on the Android operating system which has a familiar and intuitive interface. They provide familiar characteristics to many single-purpose devices, such as dedicated physical buttons for PTT and barcode scanning and offer a simplified user interface which helps minimize the learning curve for task workers who are transitioning from LMR or data capture devices. Furthermore, all of our mobile phones come equipped with our SonimWare software, which helps IT administrators more quickly provision and deploy our devices to task workers, reducing the cost and effort associated with converting to our solutions. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Consolidation of devices. A large number of devices can lead to excess bulk carried by task workers and can inhibit their mobility in the field. These specialized devices can also be expensive and typically require full replacement after end-of-life, which can be a cumbersome and costly process. By combining commonly used applications and functionality into one ruggedized device with the option for add-ons, enterprises can reduce the need for multiple, single-purpose devices. We believe that replacing outdated single-purpose devices with a Sonim device can enhance fleets’ mobility and economically streamline equipment updates or replacements. 

 
As a result of these key attributes, we believe that our ruggedized, purpose-built mobile phones can increase the productivity of task workers and significantly reduce total cost of ownership for entities deploying our solutions.

● | Invest in sales channel partnerships and brand marketing to drive sales. Our channel partners are leading global wireless carriers, distributors of data devices, communications system integrators and electronics resellers. These channel partners have large sales forces who sell our solutions to end customers in our target markets. They enable us to cost-effectively scale our business without employing a large direct sales force of our own. Our expansion into the consumer durable and connected solutions markets opens up opportunities with additional carrier partners globally. While our rugged product line was primarily targeted towards a post-paid plan user, consumer durable devices will expand our reach into pre-paid markets with large subscriber bases that are intended for a more cost-conscious user. We believe that our investment in marketing the Sonim brand and our solutions to end customers in target markets helps to raise brand awareness, deepen existing channel partnerships, and acquire and retain new channel and end customers for our solutions. 
● | Expand Sonim into the consumer durable market. The current consumer market has many choices in the premium category with high end features. The mid-low tier markets often sacrifice many of these features for a lower price point. We believe we can bridge the gap between the premium category and the mid-low tier segments through our ability to bring key rugged features in a consumer-friendly design at a lower cost. This will eliminate the need for costly service plans as well as rugged accessories. We will focus on multiple price points that focus on best-in-class specifications as compared to current competitors. Key consumer specifications will be screen sized, camera and memory. Added rugged features include reinforced housings to minimize screen breaks, IP68 ratings or higher, and extended battery life. 
● | Sonim value proposition for data devices. The data device market differs greatly from the mobile phone market in that devices are ranged by operators and customers have little choice in the device that they can buy from the operators. Sonim’s strategy with the operators is to offer feature-rich devices that are priced at a level that allows those operators to sell the devices to a wider market than previous 5G devices that had higher prices. The data devices offer customers the ability to get fast data speeds paired with ultra-low latency. The speeds associated with 5G are comparable and frequently faster than what customers are used to with their existing wireline solutions. 
● | Provide development and manufacturing services for data devices including a tablet product. The Company has successfully development and shipped a tablet product since the third quarter of 2022. The strategy has enhanced and grown our internal competence for data products, increased revenue in addition to our ruggedized phone products, and has diversified our product lines to reduce business risks.

● | Position Sonim as the leading solution for the public sector. We believe that we are at the forefront of a public safety market that has a current need for dedicated cellular networks, such as AT&T’s FirstNet, prioritized networks, such as those provided by Verizon, and the devices that enable their use. We intend to leverage the deployment of our solutions over dedicated and prioritized LTE cellular in the public safety market to further position us as a trusted global solution. As public safety agencies continue to shift to these dedicated cellular networks, we intend to deliver mobility solutions to increase security, safety and efficiency. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Position Sonim as a leading solution for industrial workers and logistics. Workers need reliable communications and data collection tools. We believe that our devices will provide not only the functionality that workers need, but also the ruggedness to ensure uptime and reduce loss of productivity due to device breakage. As businesses see the increasing productivity that mobile devices provide for their workers, we believe that they will further value rugged devices as a means of ensuring the ongoing benefit of computerization. 

Our Target Markets
 
We believe that our solutions can improve communication reliability, operational efficiency and safety for end customers and task workers in commercial sectors, public sectors, and for individual retail customers. Our ruggedized mobility solutions target three end markets: industrial enterprise, public sector, and consumers that demand a more durable product.
Industrial Enterprise
 
Transportation and Logistics. Enterprises and fleet workers across supply chain, delivery services and field management rely on mobile devices to operate safely and efficiently in environments that are often susceptible to inclement weather. For enterprises looking to improve supply chain functionality, our mobile resource management applications such as location tracking, mileage tracking, and job dispatch can help businesses monitor operations more efficiently. We believe that a weather-resistant and long-battery ruggedized device, combined with productivity applications and services with the native camera on our XP10 smartphone—provides reliable communication options for transportation and logistics workers. In addition, our solutions reduce the number of devices and tools that these task workers would need to carry in the field by consolidating the functionality of multiple single-purpose devices into one purpose-built mobile device.
 
Construction. We offer workers in the construction industry crush-, puncture-, scratch- and impact-resistant devices, which we believe to be crucial in environments where there is a high risk of such occurrences. Jobsites also value the PTT capabilities that are tightly integrated into Sonim devices. Additionally, we believe our phones and related accessories help promote worker safety and productivity, with support for lone-worker safety applications and with features such as extended battery life and extra loud-speakers. For business decision-makers, we offer devices with consolidated functionality, which enables a total cost of ownership that we believe is significantly lower versus comparable offerings that enable real-time reporting. This can help eliminate costly delays by capturing verbal, visual and location data from job sites more efficiently.
 
Manufacturing. As market demand and competition in the manufacturing sector require more nimble production lines, equipment for reliable communication and safety standard compliance are necessary to improve efficiency and keep workers safe. Our devices’ PTT functionality and extra-loud speakerphones are designed to keep lines of communication open and functional in fast-changing and loud environments, while our glove-friendly touch screen displays allow for workers to have access to real-time data, thus reducing production down time. Additionally, our devices are designed to survive blunt force and can be sanitized and sterilized for safe use in food or medical processing facilities. We believe that these features can enhance the productivity of workers in the manufacturing industry.
 
Facilities Management. Service-based operations in large indoor and outdoor facilities require management of mobile teams. Our mobile phones consolidate radio, guard tour verification, panic button systems and scanners, which otherwise would require separate and single-purpose equipment. Our devices can improve business operations through functionalities such as automated work order dispatch and job completion verification tools delivered via proprietary third-party applications integrated with our devices.
 
Energy and Utilities. The safety standards for mobile phones used in the energy and utility industry are more stringent due to the reactive characteristics of the natural resources being procured and serviced, as well as the potentially high-voltage or explosive environments. We believe we are uniquely positioned to serve these workers because a number of our devices are designed for use in potentially explosive or hazardous environments (rated Non-Incendive or Intrinsically Safe by either the CSA Group, ATEX or IECEx notified bodies), and their resistance to various chemicals and extreme temperatures. Reliable communication devices are often mission- critical for workers to stay safe while performing energy- and utility-related operations.

Public Sector
 
Public Safety. In the United States, AT&T’s FirstNet network and Verizon’s public safety prioritization provide optimized networks for this sector. Through our partnerships with the major wireless carriers, we believe we are in a strong position to provide mission-critical solutions to the public safety market as public safety networks mature. Through enhanced communication capabilities, we believe our devices can decrease the response time of first responders and help public safety workers stay safe and connected in hazardous, isolated or emergency conditions. We believe that the durability of our phones combined with their purpose-built functionality, provide a lower total cost of ownership compared to similar products, which is highly attractive to city and state decision-makers.
 
Federal Government. Whether during natural disasters or day-to-day operations, we believe our devices help provide functionality and reliability that is crucial for federal workers to protect and serve their nation. Our mobile solutions support purpose-built voice communications and data capture applications that allow federal workers to stay connected and quickly make more informed decisions while in the field.
 
Consumer Durables
 
Everyday consumers and small business users. As consumers grow more reliant upon mobile devices to support all of our daily activities, mobile devices are now more than ever being placed into situations and environments that are more prone to physical damage including screen breakage and water damage. Sonim believes that this market is currently underserved with only higher cost devices offering the features that are needed. Sonim’s value proposition will be to offer an overall lower total cost of ownership as a consumer will not need to lose valuable downtime and money repairing or replacing their device as often as other devices in the market.
Data Devices
 
Mobile hotspots are used by businesses, government employees and consumers. Having the ability to access the internet in a secure way wherever the customers go is essential to many users. Whether it is a salesperson visiting their customers, a police officer using their computer in their patrol car, a student working on a paper or a family going on vacation, the need for reliable internet has become a necessity in today’s world. With the fast speed and low latency associated with 5G, there will be new devices and applications that will rely on this technology. Mobile hotspots provide the perfect vehicle for taking advantage of these features.
 
Fixed wireless access provides an economical way for operators to quickly deploy internet to new customers as compared to digging up roads and laying cable or fiber. This service is used by businesses and consumers alike. Historically internet connectivity was effectively a monopoly business with major fixed wireline operators dividing up the country. Consumers had little choice when it came to options for internet service. With 5G, wireless operators are using fixed wireless access as a way to add new revenue streams to their businesses. Additionally, fixed wireline operators are using fixed wireless access as a way to quickly deploy to new areas.
 
Tablets are an example of a data device that we developed for a customer. The tablets are imported to the U.S., branded, and sold to a U.S. retailer. The tablets have a lower selling price and a lower margin than our other devices, but we have increased revenue by scaling the volume to meet our customers’ needs. The tablets have no inventory risk to the Company and are accretive to our net income. We will continue to look for opportunities to develop new products to meet customer’s needs. We will utilize our design, engineering, and production experience to increase the Company’s profitability.

Features of Our Ruggedized Mobile Phones
 
Our mobile phones can withstand a variety of harsh environments and are supported by our industry-leading three-year comprehensive manufacturer’s warranty for our ultra-rugged devices. We developed our devices to meet industry standards for protection from the ingress of water and/or micro-particles (IEC standard 60529). Our devices are rated a minimum of IP-68, allowing them to be submersed in up to six and a half feet of water for up to 30 minutes, and our XP10 smartphone has been further tested and certified to withstand sprays of high-pressure streams (up to 1,450 PSI) of hot (80°C) water (IPx9K). We have additionally designed and manufactured our devices to withstand repeated drops to concrete across all angles and faces, attaining MIL-STD-810G ratings and, in 2011, earning the Sonim XP3300 the title of World’s Toughest Phone by the Guinness Book of World Records after surviving a fall from 82 feet 11.7 inches to concrete. Engineered with a protective glass lens that is up to three times thicker than that of other cellular devices in the market and a unique blend of plastic and rubber used in the housings, our ultra-rugged mobile phones are designed to be resistant to punctures caused by impacts from external objects up to 2J on the display lens and 4J on the housing. Furthermore, we understand that the jobs of our end users often take them into extreme environments. As a result, we have designed our devices to operate from -4°F to +131°F, be usable while wearing work gloves (glove-friendly touch display, large physical buttons), be audible in noisy environments with loud 100+ dB loudspeakers and multiple microphone noise-cancellation technology, and, for our XP5plus and XP10 phones to last throughout an average day based on ordinary use without needing to be recharged with large, extended-life batteries. We have also designed, manufactured and certified our devices to be safe for use in potentially hazardous or explosive environments.
 
In addition, our devices provide a wide range of connectivity options for our end customers (including LTE, 3G, 4G, 5G, GSM, WiFi, NFC, location tracking and Bluetooth for certain of our devices), and our phones support a wide range of global frequencies allowing them to be used almost anywhere in the world where there is cellular coverage. Our phones are certified to work on multiple mobile network operators and come equipped with LTE Band 14 to support FirstNet (built with AT&T). We continue to explore how and when to best support the latest technologies, including 5G, and we plan to incorporate them into our product roadmap when our end market segments require such functionality, and the technology has reached a reasonable level of maturity.

Dispatchers will be able to more precisely locate where a caller is by adding the vertical dimension alongside their horizontal location of latitude and longitude, and in turn more quickly get callers the help they need. NextNav’s technology has demonstrated floor-level accuracy 94 percent of the time in independent testing conducted in 2018 by the CTIA. 

Tablets
 
In the third quarter of 2022 we expanded our product line to tablets as an interim strategy to diversify our business and to grow revenue. We can further enhance and grow our internal competencies as we start to broaden our portfolio. We expect to offer additional data devices in the future.
Accessories
 
Our portfolio of industrial-grade accessories extends beyond the traditional consumer cellular ecosystem of wall chargers and cases. We work with a number of accessory manufacturers and design partners to deliver innovative purpose-built accessories that enhance the functionality and usability of our devices. Our audio accessories take advantage of our SecureAudio Connector, which allows for accessories, like a Remote Speaker Microphone, or RSM, to be physically secured to the device via a screw mechanism that prevents accidental disconnection.

Sales and Marketing
 
As of December 31, 2022, our sales and marketing team consisted of 11 professionals located in the United States, Canada and Europe. We sell our products directly to wireless carriers, through distributors and resellers and directly to end customers. Our marketing efforts consist of product marketing, channel partner/carrier marketing and corporate marketing. Product marketing focuses on ensuring that carrier requirements related to product specifications are in-line with our brand requirements. Channel partner marketing focuses on go-to-market strategy as well as developing supplemental sales tools, carrier and non-carrier marketing campaigns, industry trade show materials and brand awareness. Corporate marketing consists of public relations, social and digital marketing and lead generation operations.
Manufacturing
 
We have outsourced the manufacturing and the final assembly to third-party ODM partners for our new phones and tablets in 2022. The Company managed the material purchases, production, and quality control that was performed by a manufacturing partner for legacy phones through August of 2022.
Competition
 
We operate in a highly competitive environment serving end customers in the industrial enterprise and public sector markets. These markets are highly fragmented, evolving and increasingly competitive. Competition in our industry is intense and has been characterized by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, significant barriers to entry in the form of carrier certification requirements, frequent new product introductions, annual operating system changes and rapid changes in end user requirements.
 
Non-rugged mobile device manufacturers have not historically created devices specifically to compete in the industrial enterprise and public sector markets. These manufacturers typically focus on a different consumer audience and the requirements to manufacture ruggedized phones differ significantly from their core products. Nevertheless, we face competition from manufacturers of non-rugged mobile phones such as Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, or Samsung. to the extent end users decide to purchase traditional devices and add a rugged case for use in environments that we believe are better suited for purpose built ruggedized mobile phones. We also face competition from manufacturers of rugged mobile phones such as Samsung, Bullitt Mobile Ltd. and Kyocera Corporation as well as from large system integrators and manufacturers of private and public wireless network equipment and devices. Competitors in this space include Harris Corporation, JVC KENWOOD Corporation, Motorola Solutions, Inc. and Tait International Limited.

We believe the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our products are the products’ performance, features (including security features), quality, design innovation, reliability, price, customer service, reputation in the industry, brand loyalty and a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem. We believe that our strongest competitive advantages are our products’ durability and reputation in the industry, as well as the push to talk capabilities not available in all competitive devices. Additionally, we believe our XP10 rugged smartphone is one of the most rugged smartphones made anywhere in the world and it is consequently able to be fully sterilized and cleaned. In order to compete, we will be required to continue to respond promptly and effectively to the challenges of technological changes and our competitors’ innovations.
 
With regard to competition from LMR providers, traditional LMR providers have chosen to not fully enter the LTE market primarily to avoid harming their significant existing LMR business. For example, certain major LMR providers have historically achieved over $3.0 billion in annual revenues from device sales. Further, these LMR providers typically do not have stocked products with major U.S. and Canadian wireless carriers. Achieving stocked product status with the wireless carriers requires that a manufacturer incur substantial cost and maintain technical know-how regarding carrier certification requirements.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our competitiveness and future success are dependent on our ability to protect our own proprietary technology and to access other important intellectual property. We protect our freedom to operate in the markets and mitigate intellectual property costs by proactively securing licenses with key patent holders, filing our own patents, trademarks, and copyrights and participating in defensive patent pools. As of December 31, 2022, we held 17 utility and design patents in the United States and 11 outside the United States and have filed 1 utility and design patent applications in the United States. We also have contractual rights to standard essential patents for 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G wireless technologies, some of which require significant royalty payments. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, we held 16 trademarks in the United States and 17 trademarks outside the United States and have filed 9 trademark applications in the United States and 11 outside the United States. We opportunistically negotiate licenses with other patent holders where appropriate for our technology.
 
Our products are built to conform to wireless standards which are covered by numerous essential patents held by third parties. Our wireless carriers require us to provide patent indemnification for the products we sell to them, and in turn we secure intellectual property indemnification from our suppliers.
 
We do not believe that our products infringe on the proprietary rights of any third parties. There can be no assurance, however, that third parties will not claim such infringement by us or our channel partners and end customers with respect to current or future products. In the past, we have had third parties assert exclusive patent or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into a royalty or licensing agreement, any of which could delay the development and commercialization of our products.
 
Our smartphone devices use the standard Android operating system and our feature phones use an operating system based on the Android Open Source Project. We additionally integrate third-party licensed software on commercially reasonable terms. Several Android-based apps and extension enablers of Android are developed internally by our employees.
 
Certain License Agreements
 
In January 2017, we entered into an amended and restated global patent license agreement, as amended in December 2018, or the Ericsson Agreement, with Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (Publ), or Ericsson, pursuant to which Ericsson granted us a license under certain Ericsson patents to manufacture and sell mobile phones that comply with certain telecommunications standards. Under the agreement, we made a one-time payment to Ericsson to partially settle royalty arrears and are obligated to pay Ericsson (i) single-digit U.S. dollar amounts per unit, which amounts are based on the particular product sold and the standards with which such products are compliant, and (ii) quarterly payments to cover the remaining royalty arrears. The Ericsson Agreement continues until January 1, 2024, unless terminated earlier by the parties. Ericsson has the right to terminate in the event (i) we materially breach the agreement and do not cure such breach within 30 days, or (ii) in the event of a change of control of our company, where the successor does not agree to the terms of the agreement. Further, Ericsson may terminate certain rights under the agreement with respect to third-party manufacturers if a third-party manufacturer files an infringement suit relating to any patents owned by Ericsson.

Legislation and Regulation
 
Wireless communication devices use radio spectrum, which is regulated by government agencies throughout the world. In the United States, use of spectrum is regulated by the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, or NTIA, for non-federal government entities and federal government entities, respectively. The FCC and NTIA allocate spectrum for various uses, including commercial wireless services and public safety services, and regulate the use of that spectrum and the devices, such as our products, that operate on that spectrum. The FCC and NTIA also adopt requirements that affect wireless equipment, such as limits on radio emissions and rules requiring that handsets have specified capabilities, such as providing location information to 911 operators. The FCC also regulates the testing and certification for the import and/or sale of certain wireless devices.
 
Other countries also have regulatory bodies that define and implement the rules for using radio spectrum, pursuant to their respective national laws and international coordination under the International Telecommunications Union. Our ability to manufacture and sell products in other countries could be affected by such rules. In addition, any significant variations between the rules in the United States and rules in other countries, including differences in available spectrum bands for wireless communication, could increase the costs of designing and manufacturing our products.
 
Research and Development
 
We allocate significant resources and funds to developing robust and innovative solutions for the end users of our products and ensuring that these solutions meet their exacting requirements for functionality and reliability. Our research and development initiatives are led by our internal teams and are supported by third-party original design manufacturers as needed. Our product management team and our sales and marketing team spend time interacting with a combination of end users and IT administrators in our target markets, wireless carriers and application and accessory ecosystem partners to better understand the market requirements for our solutions. Once defined, our engineering organization develops and tests the solution against these requirements and works to achieve technical certification and approval from the wireless carriers which allows the solutions to be sold to our end users.
Employees
 
We have 54 full time employees and 23 contractors as of December 31, 2022.
 
None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
