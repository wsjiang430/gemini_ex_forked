Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutics, starting with eye care. Our lead product candidate, TP-03 (lotilaner ophthalmic solution, 0.25%), is a novel investigational eye drop to treat blepharitis caused by the infestation of Demodex mites, which is referred to as Demodex blepharitis. Blepharitis (“Blephar” is a reference to eyelid and “itis” is a reference to inflammation) is an ophthalmic lid margin disease characterized by inflammation of the eyelid margin, redness and ocular irritation, including a specific type of eyelash dandruff called collarettes, which are pathognomonic for Demodex blepharitis. Poorly controlled and progressive blepharitis can lead to corneal damage over time and, in extreme cases, blindness. There are an estimated 25 million people in the U.S. who suffer from Demodex blepharitis. 
We designed TP-03 to target and eradicate the root cause of Demodex blepharitis – Demodex mite infestation. The active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API") of TP-03, lotilaner, paralyzes and eradicates mites and other parasites through the inhibition of parasite-specific gamma-aminobutyric acid-gated chloride ("GABA-Cl") channels. 
We intend to further advance our pipeline with lotilaner API to address several diseases across therapeutic and/or prophylactic categories in human medicine, including eye care, dermatology, and other diseases. We are investigating the development of product candidates to address targeted diseases with high unmet medical needs, which currently include TP-03 for the potential treatment of MGD, TP-04 for the potential treatment of rosacea, and TP-05 for potential Lyme disease prophylaxis and community malaria reduction.
TP-03 for the Potential Treatment of Demodex Blepharitis
We designed TP-03 to target and eradicate the root cause of Demodex blepharitis – Demodex mite infestation. The API of TP-03, lotilaner, paralyzes and eradicates mites as well as other parasites through the inhibition of parasite-specific GABA-Cl channels. 
To date, we have completed seven clinical trials for TP-03 in Demodex blepharitis that include a Phase 1 trial (the "Hyperion trial"), four Phase 2 trials, a Phase 2b/3 trial (the "Saturn-1 trial"), and the Phase 3 trial (the "Saturn-2 trial"). Each of these trials for TP-03 met primary, secondary and/or certain exploratory endpoints, with the drug well tolerated. In November 2022, we announced that the New Drug Application ("NDA") submission package for TP-03 for the treatment of Demodex blepharitis was accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), with a stated Prescription Drug User Fee Act ("PDUFA") decision date of August 25, 2023. We believe TP-03 has the potential to be the first therapeutic approved by the FDA and become the definitive standard of care for the treatment of Demodex blepharitis. 
TP-03 for the Potential Treatment of Meibomian Gland Disease (MGD)
We are also exploring the therapeutic potential of TP-03 for a second ophthalmic condition, MGD, commonly characterized as a clogging or destruction of the meibomian glands that secrete a substance that helps stabilize the ocular surface and can result in tear film deficiency, and is one of the leading causes of dry eye disease. There are no FDA-approved therapeutics for MGD. In the U.S., MGD prevalence has been found to be approximately two-thirds of the estimated 34 million dry eye patient population. One species of Demodex mite, Demodex brevis, is known to infest the meibomian gland, and clinical signs of MGD have been shown to be correlated with infestation of Demodex brevis and/or decreasing inflammation of the eye lid due to Demodex. 
In August 2022, we announced the enrollment of our first patient in the Phase 2a clinical trial (the "Ersa trial") studying TP-03 for the treatment of MGD in patients with Demodex blepharitis. We expect to report topline data from the Ersa trial during the second half of 2023.
TP-04 for the Potential Treatment of Rosacea
Rosacea is a chronic skin disease characterized by facial redness, inflammatory lesions, burning and stinging, which can flare up in response to certain triggers such as sun exposure or emotional stress. According to the U.S. National Rosacea Society, approximately 16 million people in the U.S. are affected by rosacea and rosacea prevalence can represent up to 5.4% of the global population. We conducted a Phase 1 clinical study with TP-04 and initiated a Phase 2a trial (the "Galatea trial") in March 2023, for the treatment of TP-04, a novel gel formulation of lotilaner, for the treatment of rosacea. 
TP-05 for the Potential Prevention of Lyme Disease
In December 2022, we announced positive topline results from the completed Phase 1 Callisto trial (the "Callisto trial") and enrollment of the first patient in the Phase 2a clinical trial (the "Carpo trial"). The Callisto and Carpo trials are designed to evaluate TP-05, a novel investigative oral, non-vaccine prophylactic for the potential prevention of Lyme disease. The Callisto trial was a randomized, double-blind, single and multiple-ascending dose trial that evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics ("PK") of TP-05 in healthy subjects. Results from the trial showed that TP-05 was well tolerated with no dose-related or drug-related serious adverse events. PK data from the trial demonstrated rapid absorption and an extended half-life of TP-05 that potentially supports a convenient oral therapy regimen, supporting its potential as a rapid onset, prophylactic therapy for Lyme disease. Additionally, an exploratory ex-vivo tick kill study that utilized serum from TP-05 treated subjects demonstrated potent, rapid killing of adult and nymph ticks. The Carpo trial, evaluating TP-05 for the potential prevention of Lyme disease in humans, is a randomized, double-blind trial that will evaluate the efficacy of TP-05 in killing lab grown, non-disease carrying ticks after they have attached to the skin of healthy volunteers, as well as confirm the safety, tolerability, and blood concentration of TP-05. We expect to report topline data from the Carpo trial during the second half of 2023.
We are investigating the development of TP-05 as an oral formulation that is designed as a prophylactic against Lyme disease to eradicate the tick before it can transmit the Borrelia burgdorferi infection. There are approximately 80 million people in the U.S. at risk of Lyme disease exposure, more than 27 million of which are at moderate to high risk and there are greater than 400,000 reported cases in the U.S. each year, which is believed to be an underestimation of the actual cases. Lyme disease can potentially cause severe, often debilitating symptoms with permanent and irreversible damage. The disease can result in inflammation, nerve, joint and muscle pain or swelling, numbness, shortness of breath and - in severe cases neurological complications such as facial palsy, vision issues and meningitis, including severe headaches and neck stiffness. Lyme disease can often go undetected and untreated because the ticks are not always noticed before they transmit the disease. People who are in high risk areas and/or spend extended amounts of time outdoors in wooded, grassy areas are at higher risk of contracting the infection. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ("CDC") show that the risk of Lyme disease is spreading to new geographical areas, resulting in a significant need for prophylactic solutions. Currently, there are no FDA-approved pharmacological prophylactic options for Lyme disease. We believe TP-05 is currently the only non-vaccine, drug-based, preventive therapeutic in development that targets the ticks, and potentially prevents Lyme disease transmission. It is designed to rapidly provide systemic blood levels of lotilaner, a well-characterized anti-parasitic agent that paralyzes and kills infected ticks attached to the human body before they can transmit the Borrelia burgdorferi infection that causes Lyme disease. The ticks are paralyzed and eradicated by lotilaner through selective targeting of parasite-specific GABA-CI channels.

Our Strategy
Our goal is to transform the treatment of Demodex blepharitis with a first ever FDA approved pharmaceutical therapeutic, and to develop our pipeline of innovative therapies that target certain parasite-mediated diseases with large market opportunities. We intend to achieve these goals by pursuing the following key strategic objectives:

• | Advance TP-03 to eventual approval for the treatment of Demodex blepharitis. In February 2022, we completed enrollment of our second and final TP-03 pivotal trial, the Saturn-2 trial. In May 2022, we announced positive topline results of the Saturn-2 trial, which enrolled 412 adults having, among other things, more than ten collarettes per lid and at least mild lid erythema. All pre-specified primary and secondary endpoints were met, TP-03 was well tolerated and complete resolution of Demodex blepharitis was demonstrated in patients treated with TP-03 (lotilaner ophthalmic solution, 0.25%). We utilized the data from the Saturn-2 and Saturn-1 trials to support the submission of our NDA with the FDA for TP-03 for the treatment of Demodex blepharitis. In November 2022, we announced the acceptance of our NDA by the FDA, with a stated PDUFA decision date of August 25, 2023.


• | Educate ECPs and establish our own specialty sales organization to commercialize TP-03 in the U.S. If approved by the FDA for Demodex blepharitis, we intend to commercialize TP-03 by developing our own sales organization targeting a subset of the approximately 15,000 prescribing ECPs in the U.S. Our commercialization efforts will include educating ECPs on the simplicity and speed of diagnosing Demodex blepharitis through a standard eye examination.


• | Expand the eye care applications of TP-03 for other indications, including MGD. Similar to blepharitis, MGD may also be caused by Demodex infestation, and we intend to explore TP-03 in this indication. We plan to advance the Ersa trial for MGD, with topline results expected during the second half of 2023.


• | Continue to advance and expand our pipeline, bringing novel products utilizing lotilaner to unmet needs across human medicine, including rosacea and, Lyme disease prophylaxis. The mechanism of lotilaner coupled with our insights into disease where it can demonstrate clinical benefit, provides an opportunity to expand into new indications for treatment or prevention. In December 2022, we announced positive topline data from the Callisto trial, designed to evaluate TP-05 for potential Lyme disease prophylaxis. The topline data showed that TP-05 is well tolerated and that safety data supports progression to the Phase 2a Carpo trial, which we initiated in December 2022. Topline data from the Carpo trial is expected in the second half of 2023. We initiated the Galatea trial for the potential treatment of rosacea in March 2023.


• | Evaluate and selectively enter collaborations to maximize the potential of our pipeline and the scope of our eye care product offerings. Apart from the recent out-license agreement (the "China Out-License Agreement") with LianBio Ophthalmology Limited ("LianBio") of TP-03 for the treatment of Demodex blepharitis and MGD within the China Territory as noted above, we have retained our rights globally to all of our indications for use in humans, including our lead product candidate, TP-03, for the potential treatment of Demodex blepharitis and MGD, TP-04 for the potential treatment of rosacea and TP-05 for potential Lyme disease prophylaxis and community malaria reduction. Given the potential to treat patients worldwide we may opportunistically enter into additional strategic collaborations around certain product candidates, disease and/or geographic regions.

Blepharitis: Market Overview
Blepharitis is a common, chronic ophthalmic lid margin disease characterized by inflammation of the eyelid margin, redness and ocular irritation. It is also a progressive disease that often manifests with more severe symptoms if left untreated, such as blurring of vision, missing eyelashes, corneal damage and potentially, in extreme cases, blindness. We believe that the number of Demodex blepharitis patients in the U.S. may be as high as approximately 25 million based on 'Trattler W, et al. Clin Opthalmol. 2022;doi:10.2147/OPTH.S354692' (Titan study), indicating approximately 58% of patients presenting to eye care clinics have collarettes and that at least 45 million people annually visit an eye care clinic as reported by Saydah et al. JAMA Opthalmol. 2020;138(5):479-489.doi:10.1001/jamaopthalmol.2020.0273. In addition, there is growing awareness among ECPs of the pathognomonic sign of Demodex infestation called collarettes or cyclindrical dandruff; which is a specific type of debris found at the base of the eyelashes. Collarettes are composed of partially digested epithelial cells, mite waste products and eggs among other things and can be easily diagnosed by ECPs as part of a standard eye examination. The prevalence of Demodex blepharitis increases progressively with aging, which is one main risk factor for the disease, though other frequently presenting patients can also suffer from dry eye, contact lens intolerance, and cataracts. These patients commonly present to the offices of ECPs for other ophthalmic diseases besides blepharitis, such as cataract surgery evaluation and contact lens discomfort. Accordingly, we believe that there is significant opportunity to increase the diagnosis rate of Demodex blepharitis through ECP and patient education that encourages examination of the disease in standard practice.
Despite the high prevalence of patients with Demodex blepharitis and growing awareness of the disease amongst ECPs, there are no FDA-approved therapeutics for the treatment of blepharitis let alone Demodex blepharitis. Although we believe blepharitis and Demodex blepharitis are significantly under-diagnosed diseases, with limited treatment alternatives, there are already approximately 1.5 million annual Demodex blepharitis diagnoses in the U.S. based on findings from a U.S. prevalence study (the "Titan study") and data that show blepharitis classified per the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification ("ICD-10-CM"). Demodex blepharitis is currently treated with a variety of over-the-counter remedies such as tea tree oil, lid wipes and artificial tears, as well as off-label prescription products, which often show sub-optimal efficacy, are poorly tolerated and may lead to significant irritation and dissatisfaction for patients. Furthermore, these treatments do not typically eradicate the Demodex mites, which are the root cause of Demodex blepharitis.
We have conducted epidemiology and market research on the prevalence of blepharitis and potential adoption of TP-03. Our research indicates approximately 58% of patients presenting to ECP offices have collarettes and, based on Gao et al. (2005): High Prevalence of Demodex in Eyelashes with Cylindrical Dandruff. Invst Ophth and Vis Sci, September 2005, Vol. 46, No. 3089-3094 (the “Gao Study”), all patients with collarettes were also found to have Demodex mites. In addition, our market research suggests the potential for a high level of adoption of TP-03, if approved. In our surveys, we interviewed approximately 250 ECPs, over 90% of whom indicated they would prescribe an FDA approved prescription therapy as a first-line treatment for Demodex blepharitis. Further, patients continue to have underlying risk of Demodex infestation, as there could be a recurrence or reinfestation based on the presence of Demodex mites in the facial pores even after eradication of Demodex mites from the eyelid. Our Phase 2 data from the Mars clinical trial (evaluated the safety and efficacy of TP-03 with a 28-day twice per day (“BID”), dosing regimen, with exploratory endpoints including collarette grade and mite density) and Phase 2b Jupiter clinical trial (a randomized, controlled double-blind trial with mite density and collarette grade as primary and secondary endpoints, respectively) followed patients to one year after four week treatment and showed meaningful recurrence of Demodex blepharitis within six to nine months, which increased considerably one year after treatment. Additionally, the results from the observational extension study of the Phase 2b/3 Saturn-1 trial (the "Saturn-1 Extension study"), showed meaningful collarette reduction in 63% of the patients at one year following a six week treatment. We believe there is a 
significant opportunity to increase the diagnosis rate of Demodex blepharitis and build a significant new market with the potential approval of a therapy that addresses the underlying cause of the disease.
Blepharitis Overview
Blepharitis
Blepharitis is a common chronic ophthalmic lid margin disease, which may lead to or exacerbate ocular surface disease. Blepharitis is characterized by inflammation of the eyelid margin, redness and ocular irritation, and is primarily diagnosed and treated by ECPs, including ophthalmologists and optometrists. Typical signs and symptoms of blepharitis include debris on the eyelashes, redness of the eye and eyelid, missing or misdirected eyelashes, blurring of vision, irritation, lid itchiness and ocular discomfort. Blepharitis is challenging to manage, recurs frequently, and its progression can lead to scarring of the eyelid, loss of proper eyelid and tear-film function, eyelid and lash abnormalities, inflammation of the conjunctiva and surrounding skin, suboptimal surgical outcomes, corneal damage, and potentially in extreme cases, blindness. Further, according to studies we have conducted, approximately 56% of cataract patients have Demodex infestation, which may increase the risk for infection after cataract and refractive surgery. Therefore, treating Demodex blepharitis may potentially improve patient satisfaction with cataract and refractive surgery. Additionally, the primary reason people stop wearing contact lenses is due to discomfort; blepharitis has been shown to cause contact lens intolerance. Therefore, treating Demodex blepharitis may reduce contact lens intolerance. We believe these benefits may lead to better vision and improved activities of daily living for patients.
Multiple factors can cause blepharitis, including infestation by Demodex mites, bacterial infection, clogging of the meibomian glands and seborrheic dermatitis.
The following images illustrate representative eyelids with Demodex blepharitis demonstrating the characteristic sign of collarettes:
Figure 2: Eyelids With Demodex Blepharitis
Demodex Blepharitis
Demodex infestation is a major cause of blepharitis, and we estimate that the number of Demodex blepharitis patients in the U.S. may be as high as approximately 25 million. Although we believe blepharitis and Demodex blepharitis are significantly under-diagnosed diseases, with limited treatment options, there are already an estimated 1.5 million annual Demodex blepharitis diagnoses in the U.S. based on the Titan study and coding for blepharitis classified per the ICD-10-CM. Demodex mites are the most common ectoparasite found on humans and are more likely to cause infestation and disease with aging. Demodex blepharitis typically presents bilaterally in patients with the disease. There are two species of Demodex, folliculorum and brevis, that live on the skin of the face and eyelids. Demodex folliculorum, which is commonly found in the follicle, is the more common sub-species of mite that causes Demodex blepharitis.
The pathognomonic sign of Demodex blepharitis is a specific type of eyelid debris known as the collarette, which is also sometimes referred to as cylindrical dandruff or waxy scurf. Collarettes are composed of partially digested epithelial cells, mite waste products and eggs among other things and can be easily diagnosed by ECPs with a standard eye examination known as the slit lamp examination. Other bothersome signs and symptoms of Demodex blepharitis that can lead to further disease progression include missing or misdirected eyelashes, crusting, redness of the lid margin, inflammation of the lid margin, inflammation of the conjunctiva and/or inflammation of the cornea, also known as blepharoconjunctivitis and blepharokeratitis. Demodex blepharitis is a progressive disease that often manifests with more severe signs and symptoms if left untreated, such as blurring of vision, missing eyelashes, corneal damage and potentially, in extreme cases, blindness. Furthermore, Demodex blepharitis can negatively impact daily activities and create an emotional burden for individuals with the disease.
The following figures illustrate how Demodex folliculorum mites enter and reside in the eyelash follicles:
Figure 3: Demodex folliculorum Mites Entering and Residing in Eyelash Follicles
Demodex infestation can lead to Demodex blepharitis in three main ways:

1) | Mechanical: Overcrowded mites scrape the epithelial cell lining of the eyelash follicles with their claws and lay eggs, causing follicular distention, misdirected lashes, eyelash loss and irritation. Dead mites and collarettes also obstruct the hair follicle opening, leading to inflammation.


2) | Chemical: Mites excrete digestive enzymes as they feed and exude digestive waste when they die, resulting in inflammation, redness, irritation and epithelial hyperplasia.


3) | Bacterial: Bacteria living on the mite surface or in its gut may cause inflammation of the surrounding ocular tissues. As mites scratch and feed on the skin, the partially digested epithelial cells, keratin, mite waste and eggs combine to form collarettes. These collarettes are typically found at the base of the lash but can migrate away as the hair shaft grows.

The following figure illustrates collarettes at the base of an eyelash:
Figure 4: Collarettes Are the Pathognomonic Sign of Demodex Blepharitis
The Gao study confirmed the pathognomonic relationship of the collarette to Demodex infestation. The study included 55 patients seen at the Ocular Surface Center in Miami, Florida to determine the prevalence of Demodex in eyelashes with collarettes. All patients underwent a routine, complete eye examination and external photography. Patients were divided into three main groups: those with collarettes; those without collarettes and those who had been using daily lid scrubs for a full year; and as well as those without collarettes who were not using daily lid scrubs. Of the thirty-two patients in the study, 100% of patients with at least one collarette had Demodex present. Those patients without collarettes were divided into two groups; patients who were using lid scrubs for a full year and those who were not. Only 7% (n=15) of patients without collarettes and who were not performing the daily lid scrubs had Demodex, while 50% (n=8) of those subjects without collarettes, but who were using daily lid scrubs with shampoo for a full year, had Demodex infestation, implying that hygiene alone did not eradicate the mites. All 55 patients were seen at one location and may not be representative of the U.S. population. However, subsequent studies including the two TP-03 pivotal Saturn studies that had >800 patients, consistently demonstrate a correlation between the presence of collarettes and Demodex mites.
Demodex blepharitis can be diagnosed by ECPs with a slit lamp examination, by confirming the presence of collarettes. The slit lamp examination is routinely performed by ECPs as part of standard practice during a customary eye examination, so diagnosing Demodex blepharitis via presence of collarettes would not involve any additional equipment, training or workflow alterations on the part of the ECP.
Current Treatment Options and Their Limitations
Demodex blepharitis is currently treated with a variety of over-the-counter remedies such as tea tree oil, lid wipes and artificial tears, as well as off-label prescription products for dry eye.
These approaches have significant limitations, including:

• | limited efficacy of over-the-counter and off-label treatments as well as device-based treatments administered in clinic by ECPs;


• | insufficient definitive knowledge of diagnostic criteria to guide treatment decisions;


• | prohibitive side effects (significant burning and stinging) from treatments that target Demodex mites (e.g. tea tree oil);


• | current treatments do not typically eradicate the Demodex mites, leading to a chronic and progressive disease; and


• | some treatments may be harmful (e.g. to meibomian gland epithelial cells).

According to the Titan real-world prevalence study, 75% of patients using tea tree oils and 57% of those using lid wipes were found to have a high prevalence of collarettes, indicating that current management tools for this disease are largely ineffective. The Titan study was an IRB-approved, retrospective chart review of 1,032 patients across six U.S.-based ophthalmology and optometry practices conducted by seven investigators. The study was designed to better understand the prevalence of Demodex blepharitis via collarettes in U.S. eye care clinics.
Our Approach: Treating Demodex Mites, a Root Cause of Disease
To address these limitations and high unmet need for effectively treating Demodex blepharitis, we are developing TP-03, formulated as an eye drop, which we believe, if approved, has the potential to become the standard of care for Demodex blepharitis. TP-03 is a novel therapeutic based on the drug, lotilaner, which is designed to paralyze and eradicate mites and other parasites through the inhibition of parasite-specific GABA-Cl channels. To date, TP-03 has successfully met the primary and secondary endpoints, as applicable, in the completed Phase 2b/3 Saturn-1 and Phase 3 Saturn-2 randomized, placebo controlled pivotal trials, as well as each of the four completed Phase 2 trials. TP-03 was generally well tolerated throughout these trials. As a result, we believe that TP-03 has the potential to be the first ever approved therapeutic for Demodex blepharitis.
TP-03 Eye Drops – Mechanism of Action

The active ingredient in TP-03 eye drops is lotilaner, a member of a new class of anti-parasitic molecules called isoxazolines. It is a potent non-competitive antagonist of insect and arachnid GABA-Cl channels. Lotilaner is designed to eradicate Demodex mites by selectively inhibiting GABA-Cl channels, causing mite paralysis and eventual death. It has demonstrated no binding to human GABA-Cl and other ion channels (e.g. hERG) and thus likely has no known impact on the human nervous system. Lotilaner is a lipophilic molecule, which may promote its uptake in the oily sebum of the hair follicle, where the mites reside. In clinical trials, TP-03 is topically applied to the eye twice daily to ensure delivery of the drug to the eyelid margin. Following mite eradication, collarettes eventually clear from the eyelid since they are composed of mite-related waste.

The following figures illustrate the intended paralysis of mites in the hair follicle by TP-03 administration:
Figure 5: Progression of TP-03 Application, Mite Paralysis and Eradication
Clinical Development Program
To date we have completed one Phase 1 trial, four Phase 2 trials, one Phase 2b/3 trial, and one Phase 3 trial for TP-03 in Demodex blepharitis, all of which met primary, secondary and/or certain exploratory endpoints, while demonstrating the drug was well tolerated. The TP-03 pivotal trial results (Phase 2b/3 and 3) supported the TP-03 NDA package submitted to the FDA for the treatment of Demodex blepharitis, and in November 2022, we announced the acceptance of our NDA submission package by the FDA with a PDUFA decision date of August 25, 2023. 
The Saturn-2 Trial
In May 2021, we initiated the Saturn-2 trial. It was a randomized, controlled, multicenter, double-masked trial studying the safety and efficacy of TP-03 for the treatment of Demodex blepharitis. The Saturn-2 trial was similar in design and size to Saturn-1, which met the primary and all secondary endpoints. The Saturn-2 trial's primary endpoint was the proportion 
of patients achieving collarette cure, defined as zero to two collarettes per lid. Secondary endpoints included the eradication of Demodex mites and the proportion of patients achieving a cure based on a composite of collarette cure and erythema cure (eyelid redness). A statistically significant outcome for primary efficacy endpoints is typically one of the requirements for FDA approval of a product. A statistically significant outcome indicates that the probability of the outcome occurring at random is less than the pre-established allowed error level, frequently set at 0.05 (or 1 in 20).
In May 2022, we announced positive topline results of the Saturn-2 trial, our second TP-03 pivotal trial. The Saturn-2 trial enrolled 412 adults having, among other things, more than ten collarettes per lid and at least mild lid erythema. All pre-specified primary and secondary endpoints were met, TP-03 was well tolerated and complete resolution of Demodex blepharitis was demonstrated in patients treated with TP-03 (lotilaner ophthalmic solution, 0.25%).
Primary Endpoint:
•56% of patients on TP-03 achieved complete collarette cure, defined as zero to two collarettes per lid at day 43, compared to 13% on vehicle (p<0.0001).
Secondary Endpoints:
•52% of patients on TP-03 achieved mite eradication defined as zero mites per lash at day 43, compared to 15% on vehicle (p<0.0001).
•31% of patients on TP-03 compared to 9% of patients on vehicle (p<0.0001) achieved complete lid erythema cure at day 43.
•19% of patients on TP-03 achieved a complete composite cure, based on achieving both complete collarette cure and complete lid erythema cure, compared to 4% on vehicle (p<0.0001) at day 43.
Safety Profile:
•Consistent with the results from Saturn-1, Saturn-2 demonstrated that TP-03 was well tolerated with a safety profile similar to the vehicle group. 
▪91% of TP-03 patients reported that the drop comfort was neutral to very comfortable. 
▪There were no serious treatment-related adverse events nor any treatment-related adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation. 
Additional Analysis:
▪89% of patients on TP-03 achieved a clinically meaningful collarette reduction, defined as zero to ten collarettes per lid at day 43 compared to 33% of those on vehicle (p<0.0001). 
The Saturn-1 Trial
The Saturn-1 trial was a randomized, controlled, multi center, double-masked Phase 2b/3 trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of TP-03 in adults with Demodex blepharitis. In September 2020, we commenced the Saturn-1 trial and completed enrollment of 421 patients aged 18 and over having more than ten collarettes on the upper lid and at least mild erythema of the upper eyelid margin. Each patient had at least 1.5 mites per lash on the upper and lower eyelids combined. One drop of TP-03 was self-administered twice per day in each eye for six weeks. Enrolled patients received no treatment for blepharitis symptoms (i.e. lid hygiene) during the trial or 14 days prior to enrollment. The primary endpoint was complete collarette cure (grade zero defined as - zero to two collarettes per lid) and the secondary endpoints included complete mite eradication (mite density of zero mites per lash) and composite cure (the presence of zero to two collarettes on the upper eyelid and the absence of erythema (redness)).
In June 2021, we announced positive results of the Saturn-1 trial. The pre-specified primary and secondary endpoints were met, and complete resolution of Demodex blepharitis signs (e.g. grade zero collarettes) was demonstrated in patients treated with TP-03 (lotilaner ophthalmic solution, 0.25%).
44% of patients on TP-03 achieved the primary endpoint of complete collarette reduction at day 43 compared to 7% on vehicle (p<0.0001). 81% of patients achieved a significant, clinically meaningful collarette count reduction defined as zero to ten collarettes per lid at day 43 compared to 23% of those on vehicle (p<0.0001). Additionally, a significant, clinically meaningful collarette reduction was seen in 23% of patients on TP-03 compared to 11% on vehicle as early as day 8 (p=0.0003). 
The secondary endpoint of complete mite eradication achieved statistically significant results by day 15, and 68% of patients on TP-03 achieved mite eradication compared to 18% on vehicle (p<0.0001) at day 43. 
For composite cure, 13.4% of patients on TP-03 achieved a complete cure based on a composite endpoint of collarette cure and erythema cure compared to 1.0% on vehicle (p<0.0001) at day 43. Results for complete erythema cure (19% of patients on TP-03 compared to 7% of patients on vehicle, p<0.0001) and one grade or more erythema improvement (45% of patients on TP-03 compared to 28% of patients on vehicle, p=0.0002) were also statistically significant. Additionally, 92% of TP-03 patients reported that the drop comfort was neutral to very comfortable. There were no serious treatment-related adverse events nor any treatment-related adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation.
In July 2021, we presented additional data from the Saturn-1 Trial at the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery 2021 Annual Meeting demonstrating high treatment response rates, and reinforcing the potential of TP-03 to be the standard of care for Demodex blepharitis patients. 
•95% of TP-03 patients showed a significant improvement in mite count, achieving ≤0.5 mites per lash
•93% of TP-03 patients improved by at least one collarette grade
We also announced results from an additional Saturn-1 safety analysis, which reinforced TP-03’s positive profile, revealing that TP-03 had no clinically significant adverse effect on multiple safety measures including Corrected Distance Visual Acuity ("CDVA"), corneal staining, and intraocular pressure ("IOP"), and no significant findings from slit lamp biomicroscopy or fundus exam in the study. In addition, no impact to endothelial cell density ("ECD") was demonstrated in a subset of 21 patients. ECD was further evaluated as part of the Saturn-2 trial plan and also demonstrated no impact. We believe that the results from our Saturn-1 trial, along with previously announced data, reinforce TP-03's potential, if approved.
Phase 2 Clinical Trials
We have completed four Phase 2 clinical trials to date, along with one additional ex vivo study, which included our Mars, Jupiter, Io, and Europa clinical trials. Key efficacy endpoints for our Mars and Jupiter clinical trials included collarette grade and mite density and key efficacy endpoints for our Io and Europa clinical trials included collarette cure rate based on collarette grade, which we refer to herein as collarette cure rate, and mite eradication rate. TP-03 met its primary, secondary and/or certain exploratory endpoints, as applicable, in such trials, and showed statistically significant cure and eradication rates in Io and Europa. TP-03 was generally well tolerated throughout these trials. 
Commercial Strategy for Demodex Blepharitis Launch
If approved, we plan to commercialize TP-03 in the U.S. with a specialty sales force, social and digital media, and ECP education campaigns to targeted prescribing ophthalmologists and optometrists. In our work with key opinion leaders and various associations to increase Demodex blepharitis awareness and education, we have highlighted prevalence, impact, and simplicity of diagnosis of Demodex blepharitis. Our goal is to educate ECPs about the prevalence of Demodex blepharitis, simplicity and efficient diagnosis and the positive profile of our products. In addition to educating ECPs, we believe that patient awareness and identification is important and plan to increase awareness through education and marketing efforts directed toward patients.
Consistent with our goal to educate ECPs, we have recently hired a field medical team that is actively communicating with our key ECPs across the country. We have also launched a physician facing disease education campaign geared at increased disease awareness and encouraging ECPs to more proactively diagnose Demodex blepharitis by incorporating eyelid screening as part of their routine exams.
Development of TP-03 for Meibomian Gland Disease (MGD)
Beyond Demodex blepharitis, we intend to explore the clinical potential for TP-03 in MGD, a chronic abnormality of the meibomian glands, which are glands on the inner part of the eyelid that secrete lipids and other molecules that are critical to maintaining a healthy tear film on the surface of the eye. MGD is commonly characterized in part by a widespread clogging or destruction of the meibomian glands that can result in tear film deficiency and is one of the leading causes of dry eye disease. In the U.S., MGD prevalence has been found to be approximately two-thirds of the estimated 34 million dry eye patient population. One species of Demodex mite, Demodex brevis, is known to infest the meibomian gland, and clinical signs of MGD have been shown to be correlated with Demodex brevis infestation. While dry eye is a multi-factorial disease, TP-03 is designed to relieve some of the key elements that may be contributing to MGD by virtue of causing the death of the Demodex brevis mites as well as decreasing the inflammation of the eyelid caused by Demodex blepharitis. In August 
2022, we announced the enrollment of our first patient in the Phase 2 Ersa trial studying TP-03 for the treatment of MGD. We expect to report topline results during the second half of 2023.
There are no FDA-approved therapeutics for MGD, which is currently treated with a variety of over-the-counter remedies such as tea tree oil, lid wipes and artificial tears, as well as off-label prescription products for dry eye. MGD is also treated with in-office device procedures for gland expression (de-clogging) by an ECP. Despite these existing treatments, there is still a significant need for an effective prescription therapeutic in MGD.
The following figures illustrate a representation of Demodex mites infesting the meibomian gland:

TP-04 Topical Formulation for the Treatment of Rosacea
Rosacea
Rosacea is a chronic skin disease characterized by facial redness, inflammatory lesions, burning and stinging, which can flare up in response to certain triggers such as sun exposure or emotional stress. According to the U.S. National Rosacea Society, approximately 16 million people in the U.S. are affected by rosacea and a study estimates rosacea prevalence can represent up to 5.4% of the global population. There are two phenotypes for rosacea: patients who present with papulopustular rosacea ("PPR"), and patients who do not (non-PPR), with approximately 55% of patients presenting with the PPR phenotype and 45% presenting with the non-PPR phenotype. According to primary research we conducted with dermatologists, of patients who are being treated with topicals for rosacea, an estimated 18% of overall rosacea patients are seeking treatments, with PPR patients generally more likely to seek treatment given the noticeable symptoms.
The cause of rosacea remains multifactorial but there is increasing evidence that Demodex mites play a role in the disease. Studies have found a correlation between Demodex infestation and rosacea, with a higher density of Demodex mites found in the skin of rosacea patients than in controls. A proposed theory suggests that the Bacillus oleronius bacteria has a pathogenic role, contributing to skin inflammation and the signs and symptoms of rosacea; these bacteria are also known to be sensitive to the antibiotics typically prescribed to treat rosacea. Meanwhile, Demodex mites have been shown to carry Bacillus oleronius in their digestive tracts, suggesting that Demodex may contribute to rosacea by being a transporter for the bacteria that causes the disease. Furthering that point, there is evidence to suggest that Bacillus oleronius forms a symbiotic relationship with Demodex, and that both species must be present in order to cause the signs and symptoms of rosacea. Other bacteria such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, also potentially carried by Demodex mites, may play a role in the disease as well. 
Current Treatment Options and Their Limitations
Rosacea is currently treated through topical anti-parasitic creams like ivermectin and other topicals including azelaic acid, and antibiotics like metronidazole, as well as other therapies such as alpha agonists. An estimated 50% of rosacea patients are on at least one prescription topical treatment. A current standard of care, is an anti-parasitic drug composed of 1% ivermectin cream, but is only modestly effective, takes 8 to 12 weeks to show efficacy and is around approximately $700 wholesale acquisition cost for a 30-day supply.
Other available products include Galderma's Epsolay, a topical cream containing 5% encapsulated benzoyl peroxide and Journey Medical Corporation's Zilxi, a topical foam containing 1.5% minocycline is being commercialized for the treatment of Subtype II rosacea, characterized by small, dome-shaped erythematous papules that resemble acne but are associated with burning and stinging sensations.
While current treatments can address the symptoms of the disease by reducing redness and decreasing papules and pustules, for the majority of patients, complete clearance of these features is not currently achievable and there still exists an unmet medical need.
Our Approach: TP-04 Topical Formulation for Rosacea
To address this unmet need in the rosacea market, lotilaner is being developed as a topical dermatology product, TP-04, initially for the treatment of a more severe form of rosacea, PPR. It is designed to be active after topical administration in skin with no systemic activity. Lotilaner’s mechanism of targeting and killing Demodex mites has been established through our preclinical study and clinical trials evaluating TP-03 in Demodex blepharitis, which is why we believe it may be effective in another Demodex driven disease. We believe we can improve upon existing treatments in the market, like ivermectin cream (Soolantra), with an API that is potentially more effective (longer half-life, more lipophilic, greater therapeutic window). We believe a longer half-life leads to a more durable and long-lasting treatment and that more lipophilicity is expected to provide better bioavailability in the sebum in the follicle and sebaceous glands where mites reside, thus increasing the opportunity to target and eradicate mites and a greater therapeutic window. We further believe there is potential for TP-04 to be evaluated in combination with topical anti-inflammatory agents or vasoconstrictors.
We have completed the initial preclinical studies for TP-04 and have selected a topical formulation for early clinical studies. We intend to leverage systemic preclinical data from our TP-03 program (such as embryofetal development studies, genotoxicity studies and safety pharmacology studies, and augment with the dermal toxicology studies. We plan to evaluate whether TP-04 is safe and effective at treating the symptoms of PPR in the Galatea study, a Phase 2a trial being conducted in Canada, and in March 2023 announced the initiation of this trial. Prior to commencing clinical trials in the U.S. for TP-04, we will need to obtain an investigational new drug application ("IND") from the FDA.
TP-05 Oral Formulation for the Potential Prophylactic Protection against Lyme Disease
Lyme Disease
Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the U.S., caused by infection of Borrelia bacteria following bite by a tick vector, predominantly ticks of the Ixodes genus (namely Ixodes scapularis in the U.S.). There are approximately 80 million people in the U.S. at risk of Lyme disease exposure, over 27 million of which are at moderate to high risk and there are greater than 400,000 reported cases in the U.S. each year, which is believed to be an underestimation of the actual cases. We estimate a greater than $1.3 billion impact to the U.S. healthcare system as a result of Lyme disease. Lyme disease occurs most commonly in geographical areas where the Ixodes scapularis tick is prevalent, namely in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S., but also in other regions of the U.S. Lyme disease also occurs in certain parts of Europe, typically resulting from a different Ixodes species vector.
The mechanism of Lyme disease infection is well understood. Borrelia bacteria colonizes the salivary glands of the ticks, and the infected saliva is transmitted to the human host when a tick attaches to a person for feeding. The transfer usually occurs at the conclusion of the feeding and therefore, the probability of Borrelia transmission, and thus the risk of Lyme disease, increases with the duration of the tick’s attachment. Borrelia is rarely transferred during the first or even second day of feeding but transfers quite efficiently during and after the third day of feeding (>48 hours). This window from the time of bite to the time of transmission offers an opportunity for intervention to prevent Lyme disease if the tick can be killed prior to the transfer of the Borrelia bacteria.
Lyme disease can be a serious condition that may affect multiple organ systems and produce a broad range of symptoms. Early symptoms include a localized rash, fever and fatigue. More severe, sometimes chronic, symptoms may evolve as the infection spreads, including fever, muscle and joint pain, peripheral and central neurological deficits and lymphocytic meningitis. Lyme disease can be successfully treated with oral antibiotics when diagnosed sufficiently early, but chronic symptoms can commonly persist beyond antibiotic treatment. Because many people are either undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, the treatment of Lyme disease with antibiotics may be commonly delayed or absent.
Current Lyme Prophylaxis Options and Their Limitations
Lyme disease is currently prevented through behavior modification – avoiding areas where ticks are prevalent, wearing clothing which minimizes tick exposure, using insect repellants, and physically removing ticks that have attached. With the exception of removing attached ticks, none of these approaches prevents the transmission of Borrelia post-bite.
Moreover, there are currently no FDA-approved small molecules or biologics for the prevention of Lyme disease. A vaccine for Lyme disease, LYMERix, was developed and launched by SmithKline Beecham in 1999. Approximately 1.5 million doses of the vaccine were sold in 1999, but the product was quickly pulled from the market following negative press and a class-action litigation claiming a dangerous side effect profile. We are aware of a second vaccine currently under development by Valneva in partnership with Pfizer for Lyme disease, VLA-15, an mRNA-based vaccine being developed by Yale University, and a pre-exposure prophylaxis injectable therapy being developed by MassBiologics involving a human anti-Lyme monoclonal antibody.
Our Approach: TP-05 Oral Formulation for the Prophylactic Protection against Lyme Disease
Since Borrelia is usually transferred during the second or third day following a tick bite, our approach is to eradicate the tick before it can transmit the bacteria. To do this, we are developing TP-05 as an oral formulation of lotilaner. We are targeting potentially at least 30 days of prophylactic protection against Lyme disease with a simple oral regimen of TP-05. Given that lotilaner was developed specifically, in part, to eradicate ticks with systemic administration to domesticated animals such as dogs or cats, the pharmacology of lotilaner for Lyme prophylaxis is well understood. Similar to its mechanism against Demodex mites, lotilaner is a potent non-competitive antagonist of tick GABA-Cl channels. Antagonism of these channels in ticks induces paralysis and eventual death. The high selectivity for insect and arachnid GABA-Cl channels over human channels where there has been no demonstrated binding, is a highly advantageous part of the profile of the molecule. Extensive preclinical systemic toxicology and safety pharmacology studies have been performed by third parties to date and support advancing TP-05 into clinical development. Lotilaner has a long, approximate 30-day systemic half-life in dogs, which we believe could provide for a convenient oral administration.
In December 2022, we announced positive topline results from the Phase 1 Callisto trial for TP-05, a novel, oral, non-vaccine therapeutic for the prevention of Lyme disease. The Callisto trial was a randomized, double-blind, single and multiple-ascending dose trial that evaluated the safety, tolerability, and PK of TP-05 in healthy subjects. Results from the trial showed that TP-05 was well tolerated with no dose-related or drug-related serious adverse events. Pharmacokinetic data from the trial demonstrated rapid absorption and an extended half-life of TP-05 that potentially supports a convenient oral regiment supporting its potential as a rapid onset, prophylactic therapy for Lyme disease. Additionally, exploratory ex-vivo tick kill modeling that utilized serum from TP-05 treated subjects demonstrated potent, rapid killing of adult and nymph ticks. In December 2022, we also announced the initiation of the Carpo trial, evaluating TP-05 for the potential prevention of Lyme disease in humans. The Carpo trial is a randomized, double-blind trial that will evaluate the efficacy of TP-05 in killing lab grown, non-disease carrying ticks after they have attached to the skin of healthy volunteers, as well as confirm the safety, tolerability, and blood concentration of TP-05. 
There are currently no FDA-approved pharmacological prophylactic options for Lyme disease. We believe TP-05 is currently the only non-vaccine, drug-based, preventive therapeutic in development designed to kill ticks to potentially prevent Lyme disease transmission. It is designed to rapidly provide systemic blood levels of lotilaner, a well-characterized anti-parasitic agent potentially sufficient to paralyze and kill infected ticks attached to the human body before they can transmit the Borrelia burgdorferi infection that causes Lyme disease. 
Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls ("CMC")
We do not currently own or operate and currently have no plans to establish facilities for manufacturing, storing, distributing or testing our product candidates. We rely and expect to continue to rely for the foreseeable future on contract manufacturing organizations ("CMOs") to manufacture and supply our preclinical and clinical materials to be used during the development of our product candidates. We have assembled a team of employees and consultants to oversee our technical quality and CMOs.
The product candidate TP-03 includes the lotilaner, API, formulated into a topical eye drop formulation. Only one dose strength of TP-03 is currently being developed, 0.25% lotilaner solution.
We believe that the existing capacity of our current API supplier will be sufficient to support commercial scale-up, validation and commercial launch activities if TP-03 is approved. Our current supplier currently manufactures current good manufacturing practice ("cGMP") lotilaner at multiple geographically distinct facilities.
Although we have relied on a single supplier for both non-clinical and clinical supply for lotilaner under cGMP protocols and a single CMO to manufacture TP-03 and to perform analytical testing services, it is our intent to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide lotilaner and drug product manufacturing and analytical testing services. The drug product manufacturing is a compounding and aseptic filling operation that we believe could be transferred to additional CMOs as necessary. We have identified suppliers for TP-04 topical formulation for rosacea and TP-05 oral formulation for Phase 1/2 trials for Lyme disease.
Our third-party service providers, our third-party supply chain providers, their facilities and the TP-03 used in our clinical trials or for commercial sale are required to be in compliance with the requirements of cGMP. The cGMP regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures, including requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and packaging containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. Product candidates used in late-stage clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP requirements and manufacturing specifications and processes must satisfy FDA or other authorities’ requirements before any product is approved and before we can manufacture commercial products. Our third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of TP-03 to assess compliance with applicable regulations. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party providers and supply chain providers, to comply with such statutory and regulatory requirements could subject us to possible legal or regulatory action, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, suspension of production, warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions. Any of these actions could have a material impact on clinical supplies of TP-03 or our other product candidates. Contract manufacturers at times encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid technological advancement, significant competition and an emphasis on intellectual property. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing approaches and new therapies that may become available in the future. We believe that the key competitive factors affecting the success of any of our product candidates will include efficacy, combinability, safety profile, convenience, cost, level of promotional activity devoted to them and intellectual property protection.
While there are no currently available on-label prescription pharmaceutical treatments available for the treatment of blepharitis or Demodex blepharitis specifically, a number of other treatments are currently available for the treatment of blepharitis in the U.S. Current treatments for blepharitis in the U.S. include over the counter and off-label remedies such as tea tree oil, lid wipes and artificial tears. We are aware of other companies developing prescription therapies for blepharitis, including Azura Ophthalmics, Aperta Biosciences, LLC, Formosa Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Glaukos Corp., Hovione Scientia, Nicox SA, Premark Pharma, Quorum Innovations and Viatris. To our knowledge, Azura Ophthalmics, Aperta Biosciences, LLC and Glaukos Corp. are the only companies currently focused on Demodex blepharitis and Nicox SA and Premark Pharma are the only companies with blepharitis programs that have completed Phase 2 trials.
Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
Sales and Marketing
If TP-03 receives marketing approval, we plan to commercialize TP-03 in the U.S. by developing our own sales organization targeting a subset of the approximately 15,000 prescribing ECPs in the U.S. Throughout our commercialization efforts, we have commenced and intend to further educate ECPs on Demodex blepharitis and how to properly diagnose it by having patients look down during a standard slit lamp examination. Given the importance of increasing awareness and educating patients with blepharitis, we have deployed focused social and digital marketing campaigns for TP-03. During 2022, we began the expansion of our commercial organization to support our business growth and the commercial leadership needed for TP-03 commercial launch readiness in the second half of 2023. We expect this commercial expansion to continue with a meaningful ramp during 2023 as part of our TP-03 commercial launch-readiness activities. 
Outside the U.S., we intend to further develop commercialization strategies for TP-03, which may include collaborations with other companies. In March 2021, we executed an out-license agreement with LianBio, granting exclusive commercial rights of TP-03 for the treatment of Demodex blepharitis and MGD within the China Territory. The terms of this agreement are further described below within License Agreements: LianBio Agreement.
Intellectual Property
We protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology with a combination of patent rights that we own or license in certain fields of use, trademark rights, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions. We seek not only to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology in select key global markets, but also to supplement our intellectual property portfolio with new filings and applications to enhance such protection and support commercialization of current and future product candidates. To that end, we continue to seek protection for our technological innovations and branding efforts by filing new patent and trademark applications when and where appropriate. In the normal course of business, we intend to pursue, when possible, composition, method of use, dosing and formulation patent protection, as well as manufacturing and drug development processes and technology.
Our patent portfolio includes a combination of issued patents and pending patent applications licensed from third parties, as well as those assigned solely to us based on our ongoing development activities. The patents and applications in our portfolio can be categorized as related to TP-03, TP-04, TP-05 or future pipeline product candidates and alternative technologies. Some of our issued patents and patent applications are exclusively licensed to us in therapeutic fields of use from Elanco. The patents and patent applications owned by or licensed to us worldwide include approximately 40 issued patents and approximately 57 pending patent applications.
We in-license certain of such patents and patent applications from Elanco. These patents and patent applications relate to lotilaner and are issued or pending in, for example, the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, several European territories, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, the Russian Federation, South Africa and Taiwan. The licensed-in portfolio includes approximately 38 issued patents and approximately 4 pending patent applications; the issued patents and at least some of the pending patent applications include composition of matter claims. The estimated natural expiration date of the issued in-licensed patents is approximately 2029 with a potential extension until 2032.
Approximately 36 of our owned patents and pending patent applications include treatment and composition of matter claims which relate to our TP-03 product candidate with respect to our lead indication (e.g., isoxazoline parasiticides for the treatment of Demodex blepharitis), as well as other conditions. These pending patent applications include applications in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, the Russian Federation, and South Africa. We have two granted patents with treatment claims, U.S. Pat. No. 10,835,517 issued on November 17, 2020, and U.S. Pat. No. 11,197,847 issued on December 14, 2021. The estimated natural expiration date of these issued patents are 2038, and if additional patents issue on these pending applications of ours, the estimated natural expiration dates are between approximately 2038 and 2040.
Our continuing research and development activities, technical expertise and contractual arrangements supplement our existing intellectual property protection and help us maintain our competitive position, and we rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary information and technologies, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable, or where such patents would be difficult to enforce. In order to maintain such trade secrets and other proprietary information, we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors.
We also protect our brand through trademark rights. We are the registered owner of approximately nine U.S. pending trademark applications. In order to supplement the protection of our brand, we also own at least three registered internet domain name.
License Agreements
January 2019 Elanco In-License Agreement for Skin and Eye Diseases or Conditions in Humans
In January 2019, we entered into an agreement with Elanco granting us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to certain intellectual property for the development, marketing, and commercialization of lotilaner for the treatment, palliation, prevention or cure of any eye or skin disease or condition in humans (as amended, the "Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement"). We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize products comprising lotilaner and must achieve certain developmental milestones within specified achievement deadlines. If we fail to meet these obligations, Elanco has the right to terminate the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement. We utilize the intellectual property licensed 
under the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement in our TP-03 and TP-04 product candidates. We are permitted to have certain third parties manufacture lotilaner for us and, upon Elanco's consent, additional third parties.
We made a $1.0 million upfront payment at execution of the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement in January 2019 and also made a required $1.0 million clinical milestone payment in September 2020, associated with the first two U.S. pivotal trials for the treatment of Demodex blepharitis. We paid an additional $2.0 million for our second pivotal trial milestone in April 2021, which was recorded in research and development expense in the accompanying Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company made a contractual payment of $2.5 million to Elanco following the receipt of $25 million of proceeds from LianBio during the second quarter of 2021. In June 2022, the Company made a contractual prepayment of $1.5 million that can be applied towards any milestones that become due under the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement and/or the Company’s in-license agreement with Elanco, granting it a worldwide license to certain intellectual property for the development and commercialization of lotilaner for the treatment, palliation, prevention, or cure of “all other” diseases and conditions in humans (i.e., beyond that of the eye or skin), as amended in June 2022 (the “All Human Uses Elanco Agreement”). In December 2022, the Company recognized $0.4 million of cost of license fees and collaboration revenue in the accompanying Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 upon receipt of $10 million of cash proceeds from LianBio for the achievement of a clinical development milestone, which was applied against the $1.5 million prepayment. 
In accordance with the terms of the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement, we are obligated to make further cash payments to Elanco upon our achievement of various clinical milestones up to an aggregate maximum of $3.0 million and various sales milestones up to an aggregate maximum of $79.0 million. If we receive payments from sublicensees, we are obligated to pay Elanco a variable percentage beginning in the low double-digits of such proceeds and decreasing after certain milestones are met, except for sublicense revenue generated after achieving regulatory approval for the use of lotilaner to treat or cure any eye or skin disease or condition in humans. We owe Elanco tiered royalties during the royalty term in the mid-to-high single digits on our future net sales and those of our sublicensees. The royalty term for any licensed product in a given country commences on the date of first commercial sale of such licensed product and ends on the latest of (i) expiration of the last-to-expire of the licensed patents which has at least one valid claim, (ii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity and (iii) ten years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. The Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement shall expire on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the applicable royalty term with respect to such licensed product in such country. The achievement deadlines for eye-related diligence milestones range between 18 months after contract execution to six years after contract execution. The achievement deadlines for dermatological diligence milestones range between 24 months after contract execution to nine years after contract execution.
Either party may terminate the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement upon a material breach by the other party, solely in the country pertaining to such breach, that is not cured within 60 days after receiving written notice thereof. If we fail to comply with our development obligations under the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement, and fail to remedy such failure or cure such breach within 60 days, Elanco will have the right to terminate the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement. If we fail to meet any diligence milestones by the achievement deadlines set forth in the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement for any reason other than those outside of our reasonable control, and such milestones remain unmet for 120 days after Elanco notifies us thereof, Elanco may terminate the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement. If we fail to meet certain dermatological milestones by the achievement deadlines set forth in the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement for any reasons other than those outside of our reasonable control, and such milestones remain unmet for 120 days after Elanco notifies us thereof, Elanco may limit our field of use under the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement to the treatment, palliation, prevention or cure of eye diseases or conditions in humans only. If Elanco terminates the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement for our failure to achieve a development milestone by the specified achievement deadline, then we must grant Elanco a non-exclusive, sublicensable, royalty free license to our patents and know-how relating to lotilaner to develop, manufacture and commercialize lotilaner and any licensed products for the treatment, palliation, prevention or cure of any eye or skin disease or condition in humans. Elanco may also terminate the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement if we, our affiliates or sublicensees initiate proceedings to oppose Elanco’s licensed patents and such proceeding is not withdrawn within 30 days of Elanco providing notice to us; provided that Elanco may not terminate the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement for a challenge by a sublicensee if we terminate the sublicense with such sublicensee within such 30 day period.
Under the terms of the Eye and Derm Elanco Agreement, we granted Elanco a worldwide, sublicensable, royalty-free, perpetual license to our patents related to lotilaner and the licensed products and to our know-how to research, develop, make and commercialize lotilaner and the licensed products for all applications in non-human animals, agricultural application, seed treatment applications and urban pest applications related to structural, turf, lawns and gardens. We also granted Elanco an exclusive royalty-free, perpetual license to any intellectual property we conceive from our use of lotilaner applications in non-human animals, agricultural applications, seed treatment applications and urban pest applications related to structural, turf, lawns and gardens.
Elanco retains the sole responsibility to prosecute the patents they license to us and has the first right to enforce the licensed intellectual property against third parties in the licensed field of use but cannot settle or dispose of any such action without our written consent.
September 2020 Elanco In-License Agreement for All Other Diseases or Conditions in Humans
In September 2020, we entered into an agreement with Elanco granting us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to certain intellectual property for the development, marketing, and commercialization of lotilaner for all applications in humans other than the treatment, palliation, prevention or cure of any eye or skin disease or condition (the "All Human Uses Elanco Agreement"). We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize products comprising lotilaner and must achieve certain developmental milestones within specified achievement deadlines. If we fail to meet these obligations, Elanco has the right to terminate the All Human Uses Elanco Agreement. We utilize the intellectual property licensed under the All Human Uses Elanco Agreement in our TP-05 product candidates. We are permitted to have certain third parties manufacture lotilaner for us and, upon Elanco's consent, additional third parties.
Under the terms of the All Human Uses Elanco Agreement, we issued 222,460 shares of common stock to Elanco at the execution of the September 2020 Agreement, with an estimated fair value of $3.1 million ($14.0003 per share, approximating the issuance price of our Series C preferred stock in September 2020). 
We are required to make additional cash payments to Elanco upon the achievement of various clinical milestones for an aggregate maximum of $4.0 million and various commercial and sales threshold milestones for an aggregate maximum of $77.0 million. In addition, we are obligated to pay contractual royalties to Elanco for sales in certain countries. If we receive payments from sublicensees, we are obligated to pay Elanco a variable percentage beginning in the low double-digits of such proceeds and decreasing after certain milestones are met, except for sublicense revenue generated after achieving regulatory approval for the use of lotilaner to applications in humans other than to treat or cure any eye or skin disease or condition. We owe Elanco tiered royalties during the royalty term in the mid-to-high single digits on our future net sales and those of our sublicensees. The royalty term for any licensed product in a given country commences on the date of first commercial sale of such licensed product and ends on the latest of (a) expiration of the last-to-expire of the licensed patents which has at least one valid claim, (b) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity, and (c) ten years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. The All Human Uses Elanco Agreement shall expire on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the applicable royalty term with respect to such licensed product in such country. The achievement deadlines for diligence milestones range between 24 months after contract execution to six years after contract execution.
In March 2021, the Company issued 187,500 shares of its common stock to Elanco to maintain the All Human Uses Elanco Agreement. These issued shares were valued at $5.5 million, based on our closing stock price of $29.30 per share on the date this issuance became contractually required and is reported within research and development expense on the accompanying Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the year ended December 31, 2021. In December 2022, we achieved a clinical milestone related to the initiation of our Phase 2a clinical trial for TP-05 which triggered the recognition of $0.5 million of research and development expense on the accompanying Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the year ended December 31, 2022, which partially offset the $1.5 million prepayment made to Elanco. 
Either party may terminate the All Human Uses Elanco Agreement upon a material breach by the other party, solely in the country pertaining to such breach, that is not cured within 60 days after receiving written notice from the other party. If we fail to comply with our development obligations under the All Human Uses Elanco Agreement, and fail to remedy such failure or cure such breach within 60 days, Elanco will have the right to terminate the All Human Uses Elanco Agreement. If we fail to meet any diligence milestones by the achievement deadlines set forth in the All Human Uses Elanco Agreement for any reason other than those outside of our reasonable control, and such milestones remain unmet for 120 days after Elanco notifies us of the failure to meet such diligence milestone, Elanco may terminate the All Human Uses Elanco Agreement. If Elanco terminates the All Human Uses Elanco Agreement for our failure to achieve a development milestone by the specified achievement deadline, then we must grant Elanco a non-exclusive, sublicensable, royalty free license to our patents and know-how relating to lotilaner to develop, manufacture and commercialize lotilaner and any licensed products for all applications in humans other than the treatment, palliation, prevention or cure of any eye or skin disease or condition. Elanco may also terminate the All Human Uses Elanco Agreement if we, our affiliates or sublicensees initiate proceedings to oppose Elanco’s licensed patents and such proceeding is not withdrawn within 30 days of Elanco providing notice to us; provided that Elanco may not terminate the All Human Uses Elanco Agreement for a challenge by a sublicensee if we terminate the sublicense with such sublicensee within such 30 day period.
Under the terms of the All Human Uses Elanco Agreement, we grant to Elanco a non-exclusive worldwide, sublicensable, royalty-free, perpetual license to our patents related to lotilaner and the licensed products and to our know-how to research, develop, make and commercialize lotilaner and the licensed products for all applications in non-human animals, agricultural applications, seed treatment applications and urban pest applications related to structural, turf, lawns and gardens. 
We also grant to Elanco an exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual license to any intellectual property we conceive from our use of lotilaner for all applications in non-human animals, agricultural applications, seed treatment applications and urban pest applications related to structural, turf, lawns and gardens.
Elanco retains the sole responsibility to prosecute the patents they license to us and has the first right to enforce the licensed intellectual property against third parties in the licensed field of use but cannot settle or dispose of any such action without our written consent.
LianBio Agreement
On March 26, 2021, we entered into a development and license agreement (the “China Out-License”) with LianBio for its exclusive development and commercialization rights of TP-03 (lotilaner ophthalmic solution, 0.25%) in the China Territory for the treatment of Demodex blepharitis and MGD. 
Through December 31, 2022, we received payments from LianBio totaling $80.0 million comprised of initial consideration of $15.0 million and $65.0 million for the achievement of specified milestone events.
We will be eligible to receive further consideration from LianBio upon the achievement of additional TP-03 events, including: (i) additional development milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $25.0 million (includes $2.5 million for a milestone triggered in February 2023), (ii) China-based TP-03 sales threshold milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $100.0 million, (iii) tiered low-to-high-teen royalties for the China Territory TP-03 product sales, and (iv) vesting of a LianBio equity warrant upon certain regulatory milestones. The term of the China Out-License will expire upon the expiration of the royalty term in the China Territory, as defined in the agreement, unless earlier terminated. LianBio may also terminate the China Out-License for any reason upon ninety days’ prior notice to us. 
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the U.S. at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products such as those we are developing. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. We will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or trials or seek approval of our product candidates. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the U.S. and other countries, as appropriate, along with subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and resources.
U.S. Drug Regulation
In the U.S., we are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, which regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the "FDCA"), and its implementing regulations. FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the U.S. Drugs also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. or foreign requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-marketing may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business, market acceptance of our products, and our reputation.
Our product candidates are considered small molecule drugs and must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. The process generally involves the following:

• | completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice ("GLP") requirements;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the U.S. and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;


• | approval by an independent IRB or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, GCP, requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept the submission for review;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements, and of selected clinical investigational sites to assess compliance with GCP;


• | potential FDA audit of the preclinical study and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA filing;


• | payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA;


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the U.S.; and


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Migration Strategy ("REMS") and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.

The data required to support an NDA are generated in two distinct developmental stages: preclinical and clinical. The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process can take many years and the actual time required to obtain approval, if any, may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or condition being treated.
Preclinical Studies and IND Submission
Before testing any drug product candidate in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for certain safety/toxicology studies. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the U.S.
An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA and clinical trials may proceed under such IND at such time, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development along with any subsequent changes to the investigational plan.
Clinical Trials
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries, including the website maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, ClinicalTrials.gov.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the U.S. may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may still submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA. The FDA may agree to accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection, if deemed necessary, and the practice of medicine in the foreign country is consistent with the U.S.
Clinical trials in the U.S. generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined.

• | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, tolerability and safety of the drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.


• | Phase 2 clinical trials generally involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose and dosing schedule required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.


• | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the product for its intended use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product to provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.


• | A Phase 1/2 clinical trial has elements of a Phase 1 trial and a Phase 2 trial. We have designated our TP-04 and TP-05 trials as Phase 1/2 trials since we intend to go beyond the typical safety and tolerability assessments of a Phase 1 trial and intend to have these trials include additional efficacy assessments as well.


• | A Phase 2b/3 clinical trial has elements of a late Phase 2 trial and a Phase 3 trial. We have designated Saturn-1 as a Phase 2b/3 trial as it is both our first multi-center trial based in the U.S., and also a pivotal trial for the U.S.

Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol.
Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Equivalent, and similarly detailed, obligations will apply to the conduct of clinical trials in third countries including the European Union (“EU”).
NDA Review and Marketing Approval
Following completion of clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information, and other information in a request for approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications. The application must include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-
sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of FDA. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be marketed in the U.S.
Under the PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by an application user fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for each marketed human drug. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a qualifying small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product NDA also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all submitted NDAs before it accepts them for filing to determine if they are sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, and the FDA may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. 
Under PDUFA, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs through a two-tiered classification system, standard review and priority review. According to PDUFA performance goals, the FDA endeavors to review applications subject to standard review within ten months, whereas the FDA’s goal is to review priority review applications within six months, depending on whether the drug is a new molecular entity. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements.
The FDA generally accepts data from foreign clinical trials in support of an NDA if the trials were conducted under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the FDA nevertheless may accept the data in support of an NDA if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection, if deemed necessary. Although the FDA generally requests that marketing applications be supported by some data from domestic clinical studies, the FDA may accept foreign data as the sole basis for marketing approval if (1) the foreign data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice, (2) the studies were performed by clinical investigators with recognized competence, and (3) the data may be considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection or, if the FDA considers the inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means.
Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA also closely analyzes the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process.
After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications and potentially subject to other requirements. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, including 
the potential requirement to conduct additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, or to conduct additional preclinical studies or manufacturing changes. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
Post-Approval Requirements
Following approval of a new product, the product is subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to facility registration and drug listing monitoring and record keeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drugs, including after they are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.
Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication.
The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ("REMS"), to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes that a REMS is needed, the NDA sponsor must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the FDA without an approved REMS, if required. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation, and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, its manufacturer or the NDA holder, including recalls.
The FDA may withdraw approval of a product if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Corrective action could delay drug distribution and require significant time and financial expenditures. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls;


• | fines, warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical trials;


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;


• | suspension or revocation of product approvals;


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

Other Regulatory Matters
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. For example, in the U.S., sales, marketing and scientific and educational programs also must comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, transparency laws, government price reporting, and health information privacy and security laws. These laws include the following:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of an item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act;


• | the federal civil False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties, sometimes pursued through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment of government funds that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government;


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA"), which imposes criminal liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense, or knowingly and willfully making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 


• | HIPAA and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, on certain covered entity health care providers, health plans and health care clearinghouses as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;


• | federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;


• | the FDCA, which prohibits, among other things, the adulteration or misbranding of drugs, biologics and medical devices, including off-label or pre-approval promotion;


• | the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS") information regarding direct or indirect payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals (and certain other practitioners as of 2022), as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non- governmental third-party payers, including private insurers, state laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, state laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report information on the pricing of certain drug products, state and local laws that require the licensure and registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, and state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Furthermore, states are constantly adopting new laws or amending existing laws, requiring attention to frequently changing regulatory requirements. For example, California has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"). The CCPA created new transparency requirements, granted California consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) 
several new rights with regard their personal information, and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allow for a new cause of action for data breaches. In addition, in November 2020, California voters approved the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) ballot initiative which introduced significant amendments to the CCPA and established and funded a dedicated California privacy regulator, the California Privacy Protection Agency (“CPPA”). The amendments introduced by the CPRA went into effect on January 1, 2023, and new implementing regulations are expected to be introduced by the CPPA. Failure to comply with the CCPA may result in, among other things, significant civil penalties and injunctive relief, or potential statutory or actual damages. In addition, California residents have the right to bring a private right of action in connection with certain types of incidents. These claims may result in significant liability and potential damages. The CCPA could impact our business activities depending on how it is interpreted and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information. We have implemented processes to manage compliance with the CCPA and we continue to assess the impact of the CPRA, and other state legislation, on our business as additional information and guidance becomes available.
Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, compliance oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.
U.S. Patent-Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of any future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO"), in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application ("ANDA") or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full 505(b)(1) NDA. 
However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
European Union Drug Development
Similar to the U.S., the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the European Union Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the regime of the Clinical Trials Directive, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority ("NCA"), and one or more ethics committees. Under the regime of the Clinical Trials Directive all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
In order to streamline the regulation of clinical trials across the EU, the EU legislator has adopted Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, or the EU Clinical Trials Regulation. The new EU Clinical Trials Regulation, which repeals and replaces the EU Clinical Trials Directive, introduces a complete overhaul of the existing regulation of clinical trials for medicinal products in the EU. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure through a single entry point, the “EU portal”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. The EU Clinical Trials Regulation is applicable as of January 31, 2022 and is applicable directly in all countries of the EEA (which is comprised of 27 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein). Clinical trials authorized under the current Clinical Trials Directive before January 31, 2023 can continue to be conducted under the Clinical Trials Directive until January 31, 2025. An application to transition ongoing trials from the current Clinical Trials Directive to the new Clinical Trials Regulation will need to be submitted and authorized in time before the end of the transitional period. The new Clinical Trials Regulation is intended to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EEA.
European Union Drug Review and Approval
In order to market any product outside of the U.S., a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety, and efficacy, and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales, and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trial or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions.
Marketing Authorization
In the EEA, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are a number of types of marketing authorizations.

• | The Community MA is adopted by the European Commission in the form of a decision through the Centralized Procedure. The decision, which is based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ("CHMP") of the EMA, is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional, on approval by the EMA for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union.

Under the Centralized Procedure, the CHMP established at the EMA is responsible for conducting an initial scientific assessment of a product. The maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MA under the Centralized Procedure is 210 days, excluding clock stops when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP.
Accelerated evaluation may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP 
accepts such a request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the Centralized Procedure if it determines that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.

• | MAs based on the Mutual Recognition Procedure or the Decentralized Procedure are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product is first authorized by a Reference Member State this may be recognized by other Concerned Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. Alternatively, a product can be approved simultaneously in various EU Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the EU Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State. The competent authority of the Reference Member State prepares a draft assessment report, a draft Summary of Product Characteristics ("SmPC") and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the "Concerned Member States") for their approval. If the Concerned Member States raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling or packaging proposed by the Reference Member State, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the Reference Member State and the Concerned Member States).

Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payers, such as government health programs, commercial insurance, and managed healthcare organizations. In the U.S., for example, principal decisions about reimbursement for new products are typically made by CMS or by Medicare’s contractors and third-party payers or insurance plans. These entities decide whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed based on clinical needs and economic impact. To date no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payer-by-payer basis.
Increasingly, third-party payers are requiring that drug companies provide them with discounts usually in the form of rebates from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Further, such payers are examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of newly launched drugs. There may be especially significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs as several large payers have implemented new to market blocks that can last anywhere between six to twelve months. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific product candidates on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of our products. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
If we successfully commercialize any of our product candidates, we may participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Participation is required for federal funds to be available for our covered outpatient drugs under Medicaid and, if applicable, Medicare Part D. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, we would be required to pay a mandatory rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for our drugs under Medicaid and, if applicable, Part B of the Medicare program.
Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program also participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part D. The 340B drug pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B ceiling price for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients.
In addition, in order to be eligible to have its products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, a manufacturer also must participate in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs ("VA") Federal Supply Schedule ("FSS") pricing program. Under this program, the manufacturer is obligated to make its innovator and single source products available for procurement on an FSS contract and charge a price to four federal agencies, the VA, U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD"), Public Health Service and U.S. Coast Guard - that is no higher than the statutory Federal Ceiling Price ("FCP"). Manufacturers also are obligated to calculate and submit to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis, their Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price (“Non-FAMP”), which the VA uses to calculate the FCP. Moreover, pursuant to regulations issued by the DoD Defense Health Agency to implement 
Section 703 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, manufacturers are required to provide rebates on utilization of their innovator and single source products that are dispensed to TRICARE beneficiaries by TRICARE network retail pharmacies.
The requirements under the Medicaid, 340B, FSS, and TRICARE programs could reduce the revenue we may generate from any products that are commercialized in the future and could adversely affect our business and operating results. If we fail to comply with any applicable obligations under governmental pricing programs that we participate in, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, significant civil monetary penalties, sanctions and fines, and those could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.
In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Pharmaceutical products may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products and may also compete with imported foreign products. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing.
Healthcare Reform
The U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. The Affordable Care Act made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate. The Affordable Care Act also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. 
There have been judicial challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, as well as efforts by Congress to modify, and by agencies to alter the implementation of, certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, Congress eliminated, starting January 1, 2019, the tax penalty for not complying with the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate to carry health insurance. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amended the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the donut hole.
It is possible that the ACA, as currently enacted or may be amended in the future, as well as other healthcare reform measures including those that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria, and less favorable payment methodologies, or other downward pressure on coverage and payment and the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement or restriction on coverage under Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction or restriction by private payers. 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, effective April 1, 2013, required by the Budget Control Act of 2021, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (“ATRA”). Subsequent legislation extended the 2% reduction, generally to 2031. Sequestration is currently set at 2% and will increase to 2.25% for the first half of fiscal year 2030, to 3% for the second half of fiscal year 2030, and to 4% for the remainder of the sequestration period that lasts through the first six months of fiscal year 2031. ATRA, among other things, also reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Other new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our drugs, if approved, and accordingly, our financial operations.
Additionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Moreover, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private third-party payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates and in establishing their formulary placement.
Further, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, into law. 
The IRA introduces several changes to the Medicare Part D benefit, including a limit on annual out-of-pocket costs and a change in manufacturer liability under the program which could negatively affect the profitability of our product candidates. The IRA sunsets the current Part D coverage gap discount program starting in 2025 and replaces it with a new manufacturer discount program. Failure to pay a discount under this new program will be subject to a civil monetary penalty. In addition, the IRA establishes a Medicare Part B inflation rebate scheme effective January 2023 and a Medicare Part D inflation rebate scheme effective October 2022, under which, generally speaking, manufacturers will owe rebates if the price of a Part B or Part D drug increases faster than the pace of inflation. Failure to timely pay a Part B or D inflation rebate is subject to a civil monetary penalty. The IRA also creates a drug price negotiation program under which the prices for Medicare units of certain high Medicare spend drugs and biologicals without generic or biosimilar competition will be capped by reference to, among other things, a specified non-federal average manufacturer price starting in 2026. Failure to comply with requirements under the drug price negotiation program is subject to an excise tax and/or a civil monetary penalty. Congress continues to examine various policy proposals that may result in pressure on the prices of prescription drugs with respect to the government health benefit programs and otherwise. The IRA or other legislative changes could impact the market conditions for our product candidates.
