Overview
 
Harvard Bioscience, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a leading developer, manufacturer and seller of technologies, products and services that enable fundamental advances in life science applications, including research, pharmaceutical and therapy discovery, bio-production and preclinical testing for pharmaceutical and therapy development. Our products and services are sold globally to customers ranging from renowned academic institutions and government laboratories to the world’s leading pharmaceutical, biotechnology and contract research organizations. With operations in North America, Europe and China, we sell through a combination of direct and distribution channels to customers around the world.
Recent Developments
 
Global Supply Chain and Economic Environment
 
The global supply chain has experienced significant disruptions due to electronic component and labor shortages and other macroeconomic factors which have emerged since the onset of COVID-19, leading to increased cost of freight, purchased materials, and manufacturing labor costs, while also delaying customer shipments. We expect these supply chain trends to continue into 2023. These conditions, in addition to the overall impacts on the global economy, have negatively impacted our results of operations and cash flows.
 
Additionally, during 2022 the global economy has experienced high levels of inflation, rising interest rates, significant fluctuations in currency values, and increasing economic uncertainty, particularly in Europe. Our results of operations have been negatively impacted by higher costs of raw materials, labor and freight resulting from inflationary pressures. These factors and global events including the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, a softening economy in Europe, and rising interest rates on our debt have had a negative impact on our results of operations.
 
COVID-19
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on our operations to date and the future impacts of the pandemic and any resulting economic impact remain largely unknown and continue to evolve. Many countries worldwide continue to issue COVID-19 related restrictive orders in an attempt to control the effects of the pandemic. In particular, during the beginning of 2022, China implemented area-wide shutdowns in order to control the spread of COVID-19, which continued in different parts of China throughout 2022. Such shutdowns had an adverse impact on our financial results for fiscal 2022.

If business interruptions resulting from the current macroeconomic conditions or COVID-19 described above were to be prolonged or expanded in scope, the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would likely be negatively impacted. If the impacts of the supply chain disruptions are more severe than we expect, it could result in longer lead times and further increased costs, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Our History and Strategy 
 
Our business began in 1901 under the name Harvard Apparatus. It was founded by Dr. William T. Porter, a Professor of Physiology at Harvard Medical School and a pioneer of physiology education. We have grown over the years with the development and evolution of modern life science research and education. Our early inventions included ventilators based on Dr. Porter’s design, the mechanical syringe pump for drug infusion in the 1950s, and the microprocessor-controlled syringe pump in the 1980s.
 
In 1996, a group of investors acquired a majority of the then existing business of our predecessor, Harvard Apparatus, Inc. Following this acquisition, our focus was redirected to acquiring complementary companies with innovative technologies while continuing to grow the existing business through internal product development. Since 1996, we have completed multiple business or product line acquisitions related to our continuing operations. Harvard Bioscience, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware in September 2000 and became the successor entity to Harvard Apparatus, Inc. by merger in November 2000.
 
In 2018, we acquired Data Sciences International, Inc. (“DSI”), a global leader in products, services and solutions focused on preclinical testing. The DSI product portfolio, which is largely complementary to our cellular and molecular technology (“CMT”) product portfolio, expanded our product portfolio to address the continuum from research and discovery to preclinical testing with principal application in pharmaceutical and therapy testing. 
 
In 2019, we initiated a restructuring program to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs which entailed consolidating and downsizing several sites and reducing headcount in Europe and North America. This program was completed in 2021.
 
During 2022, we completed a review of our business and product portfolio and identified opportunities to rationalize our product portfolio, improve our cost structure and optimize our sales organization. In connection with this review, we identified certain non-strategic products for discontinuation and further reduced our headcount in Europe and North America. We believe that these actions, which were completed in 2022, will allow us to focus on product opportunities that drive sustainable revenue growth with attractive gross margins and improved profitability.
 
Our Products
 
As noted above, our products and services enable fundamental advances in life science applications, including research, pharmaceutical and therapy discovery, bio-production and preclinical testing.
 
We have organized our product line activities into two product families, CMT and Preclinical.    
 
Our CMT product family is primarily composed of products supporting research related to molecular, cellular organ and organoid technologies, with additional application in the emerging field of bio-production of pharmaceuticals and therapeutics. The principal customers for our CMT products include academic and government laboratories, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and contract research organizations.
 
Our Preclinical product family includes four business lines that support the preclinical research and testing phase for drug development, and in particular testing related to data collection and analysis for safety and regulatory compliance. Preclinical products are primarily sold to pharmaceutical, biotechnology and contract research organizations, as well as larger academic labs.

We sell our products under several brand names, including Harvard Apparatus, DSI, Buxco, Biochrom, BTX, Heka, Hugo Sachs, Multichannel Systems MCS GmbH (“MCS”), and Panlab.
 
Our solutions range from simple to complex, and generally consist of hardware/firmware and software products, augmented with consumables, options, upgrades and post-sales (scientific, installation and data) services. Sales prices of these products and services range typically from $1,000 to over $100,000. Our products include spectrophotometers that analyze light to detect and quantify a wide range of molecules as well as cell analysis and electroporation and electrofusion systems to influence and/or analyze cellular processes. Other products and services focus on tissue and organ responses to new drugs and encompass wireless monitors, and signal acquisition and analysis functionality. We also feature products that monitor physiological processes in living organisms to study behavior. Many of our proprietary products are leaders in their fields. 
 
In addition to our proprietarily manufactured products, we distribute products developed by other manufacturers. These distributed products accounted for approximately 15% and 14% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Resale of such products enables us to act as a single source for our customers’ research needs. They consist of a large variety of complementing instruments or accessories as well as consumables used in experiments involving fluid handling, molecular and cell analysis and tissue, organ and animal research.
 
Below is a description of each product family.

Customers 
 
Our end-user customers are primarily research scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, hospitals, government laboratories, including the United States National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), and contract research organizations (“CROs”). Our pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers have included pharmaceutical companies and research laboratories such as Pfizer, Amgen, Inc., AstraZeneca plc, Genentech, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson. Our academic customers include major colleges and universities including Harvard University, Cambridge University, Johns Hopkins University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Yale University, the University of California system, Baylor College of Medicine, and the University of Texas and Imperial College London. Our CRO customers include Labcorp, Charles River Laboratories and Wuxi AppTec. We have a wide range of diverse customers worldwide and no customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues in 2022.
Sales
 
We conduct direct sales in the United States, China and major European markets. We sell primarily through distributors in other countries. For the year ended December 31, 2022, revenues from direct sales to end-users represented approximately 63% of our revenues; and revenues from sales of our products through distributors represented approximately 37% of our revenues.
Direct Sales
 
We have a global sales organization managing both direct sales and distributors. Our websites and marketing collateral serve as the primary sales tool for our product lines, which includes both proprietary manufactured products and complementary products from various suppliers.
Sales through Distributors
 
We engage distributors for the sales of our own branded and private label products in certain areas of the world and for certain product lines.
 
Marketing
 
We have a centralized marketing group, which encompasses product management, and market communications. Marketing maintains value-proposition based product roadmaps, collaborates with research and development on timing and investment for new products, supports direct and distributor sales activities, sets the global pricing of our products and conceives the storylines on how to sell our products. Marketing also maintains digital presence across the web and social media platforms, creates electronic leads and analyzes opportunities for new product portfolio extensions.
Research and Development
 
Our principal research and development mission is to develop products that address growth opportunities within the life science research process as well as to maintain and optimize our existing product portfolios. We maintain development staff in many of our manufacturing facilities to design and develop new products and to re-engineer existing products to bring them to the next generation. Our research and development expenses were approximately $12.3 million and $10.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We anticipate that we will continue to make investments in research and development activities to advance our position in the industry as a provider of life science equipment, software and services. We plan to continue to pursue a balanced development portfolio strategy of originating new products from internal research and acquiring products and technologies through business and technology acquisitions or collaborations, as appropriate.
Manufacturing
 
We manufacture and test the majority of our products in our principal manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Sweden, Spain and Germany. We have considerable manufacturing flexibility at our various facilities, and each facility can manufacture multiple products at the same time. We maintain in-house manufacturing expertise, technologies and resources. We seek to maintain multiple suppliers for key components that are not manufactured in-house, and while some of our products are dependent on sole-source suppliers, we have made investments in new talent in procurement and other functions to reduce exposures related to sole-source suppliers, and are accelerating these efforts given the dynamics of the global supply chain in 2022. Our manufacturing operations primarily involve assembly and testing activities along with some machine-based processes. Going forward we will continue to evaluate our manufacturing facilities and operations in order to optimize our manufacturing footprint.
 
See “Part I, Item 2. Properties” of this report for additional information regarding our manufacturing facilities.

Competition
 
The markets into which we sell our products are highly competitive, and we expect the intensity of competition to continue or increase. We compete with many companies engaged in developing and selling tools for life science research. Many of our competitors have greater financial, operational, sales and marketing resources and more experience in research and development and commercialization than we have. Moreover, our competitors may have greater name recognition than we do, and many offer discounts as a competitive tactic. These competitors and other companies may have developed or could in the future develop new technologies that compete with our products, which could render our products obsolete. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to make the enhancements to our technologies necessary to compete successfully with newly emerging technologies. We believe that we offer one of the broadest selections of products to organizations engaged in life science research. We have numerous competitors on a product line basis. We believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of product performance, including quality, reliability, speed, technical support, price and delivery time.
 
We compete with several companies that provide instruments for life science research including, Lonza Group Ltd., Becton Dickinson, Eppendorf AG, Kent Scientific Corporation, Danaher Corporation, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., PerkinElmer, Inc., Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. Instem plc, Emka Technologies and TSE Systems.
 
We cannot forecast if or when these or other companies may develop competitive products. We expect that other products will compete with our products and potential products based on efficacy, safety, cost and intellectual property positions. While we believe that these will be the primary competitive factors, other factors include, in certain instances, availability of supply, manufacturing, marketing and sales expertise and capability.
 
Seasonality
 
Sales and earnings in our third quarter are usually flat or down from the second quarter primarily because there are a large number of holidays and vacations during such quarter, especially in Europe. Our fourth quarter revenues and earnings are often the highest in any fiscal year compared to the other three quarters, primarily because many of our customers tend to spend budgeted money before their own fiscal year ends.
Intellectual Property
 
To establish and protect our proprietary technologies and products, we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality provisions in our contracts. Patents or patent applications cover certain of our new technologies. Most of our more mature product lines are protected by trade names and trade secrets only.
 
We have implemented a patent strategy designed to provide us with freedom to operate and facilitate commercialization of our current and future products. Our success depends, to a significant degree, upon our ability to develop proprietary products and technologies. We intend to continue to file patent applications covering new products and technologies where it is appropriate to do so taking into account factors such as the likely scope of coverage, strategic value, and cost.
 
Patents provide some degree of protection for our intellectual property. However, the assertion of patent protection involves complex legal and factual determinations and is therefore uncertain. The scope of any of our issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to offer meaningful protection. In addition, our issued patents or patents licensed to us may be successfully challenged, invalidated, circumvented or unenforceable so that our patent rights would not create an effective competitive barrier. Moreover, the laws of some foreign countries may protect our proprietary rights to a greater or lesser extent than the laws of the United States. In addition, the laws governing patentability and the scope of patent coverage continue to evolve, particularly in areas of interest to us. As a result, there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from any of our patent applications or from applications licensed to us. As a result of these factors, our intellectual property positions bear some degree of uncertainty.
 
We also rely in part on trade secret protection of our intellectual property. We attempt to protect our trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, employees and consultants. Our employees and consultants also sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their interests in patents and copyrights arising from their work for us. Although many of our United States employees have signed agreements not to compete unfairly with us during their employment and after termination of their employment, through the misuse of confidential information, soliciting employees, soliciting customers and the like, the enforceability of these provisions varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and, in some circumstances, they may not be enforceable. In addition, it is possible that these agreements may be breached or invalidated and if so, there may not be an adequate corrective remedy available. Despite the measures we have taken to protect our intellectual property, we cannot provide assurance that third parties will not independently discover or invent competing technologies or reverse engineer our trade secrets or other technologies. Therefore, the measures we are taking to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate.

We do not believe that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of any third party. We cannot assure, however, that third parties will not claim such infringement by us or our licensors with respect to current or future products. We expect that product developers in our market will increasingly be subject to such claims as the number of products and competitors in our market segment grows and the product functionality in different market segments overlaps. In addition, patents on production and business methods are becoming more common and we expect that more patents will be issued in our technical field. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of management’s attention and resources, cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Moreover, such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be on terms advantageous to us, or acceptable at all, which could seriously harm our business or financial condition.
 
“Harvard” is a registered trademark of Harvard University. The marks “Harvard Apparatus” and “Harvard Bioscience” are being used pursuant to a license agreement entered into in December 2002 between us and Harvard University.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are generally not subject to direct governmental regulation other than the laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses in the domestic and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. In particular, other than our amino asset analyzer product, our current products are not subject to pre-market approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration for use on human clinical patients. In addition, we believe we are materially in compliance with all relevant environmental laws.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 455 employees, which included 436 full-time employees. Some of our employees in Europe have statutory collective bargaining rights. We have never experienced a general work stoppage or strike, and management believes that our relations with our employees are good. Additional information about our employees follows:
