Company Overview
Our platform, The Digital Forge, is an easy-to-use, reliable and intelligent additive manufacturing platform powering engineers, designers and manufacturing professionals globally. The Digital Forge combines precise & reliable 3D printers and metal and composite proprietary materials with its cloud-based learning software offering to empower manufacturers to create more resilient and flexible supply chains. Markforged is based in greater Boston, Massachusetts, where we have our own in-house manufacturing facility where we design industrial 3D printers, software and metal and composite proprietary materials. We also own a design and manufacturing facility located in Hoganas, Sweden, and maintain several sales and sales support offices globally.
Designed to scale into the future, our software-enabled platform delivers clear value today to thousands of customers (including both direct customers and customers of our value added resellers that have purchased one or more of our products) around the world. Our customers have printed millions of parts, meeting customer needs across the entire product development lifecycle, including design-phase, tooling, production and aftermarket spares and replacement parts as well as mid-volume and high-volume production parts. Blue chip customers in leading-edge industries such as aerospace, military and defense, industrial automation, space exploration, healthcare and automotive rely on our platform for mission-critical, end-use parts on-demand and at the point-of-need.
Our portfolio of rugged 3D printers include: (i) desktop printers that produce quality parts in settings where space is limited, (ii) industrial composite printers that provide powerful, predictable functionality through their software, sensors, materials and print modes and (iii) metal printers that can fabricate strong, complex metal parts in a variety of advanced metals both in low volume and in higher volumes utilizing our metal binder jetting solution. Across all our models, our powerful yet easy-to-use platform, and our industrial-grade materials, enable engineers to make functional parts for manufacturing environments and other demanding applications.
Our proprietary software provides a single platform to interact with many of our hardware devices, driving consistent reliability for our customers. From simple file storage and versioning to accessible live telemetry, our products are designed to address the unseen minutiae that can inhibit manufacturers’ productivity. In a manufacturing ecosystem inundated with non-intuitive user experiences, the simplicity and power of our software drives adoption of our platform to empower manufacturing at the point of need.
Today, manufacturers face many limitations from idea generation to finished industrial goods. Part design is inherently limited by traditional subtractive manufacturing methods, such as Computer Numerically Controlled (“CNC”) machining. In addition, in many cases, the existing manufacturing workforce does not have the necessary skills to meet the demands of the next generation of manufacturing, which is embracing digital technologies.

Our patented Continuous Fiber Reinforcement (“CFR”) process uses continuous strands of composite fibers to make parts as strong as and capable of replacing aluminum. Our Metal X system is capable of printing 17-4 PH Stainless Steel, Copper, H13 Tool Steel, Inconel 635, and A2 and D2 Tool Steel to solve those demanding applications that require metal. These products connect to our secure cloud infrastructure and are controlled via web browser, providing a single, simple digital workflow for printing both carbon fiber and metal for organizations that scale from one user to thousands. We have the ability to leverage data from our existing global fleet of printers connected to cloud architecture to enhance our research and development capabilities for the future benefit of our customers. The data generated by our fleet of thousands of connected printers flows into Blacksmith, an AI-powered, closed-loop manufacturing solution, which is currently offered as a software subscription.
Industry Background
Traditional Manufacturing Faces Many Limitations.
Engineers and product developers are constrained by the physical parameters of conventional manufacturing processes. These parameters define the design possibilities, adding cost and lead time to manufacturing programs and placing firm boundaries on the performance of parts and products. Additive manufacturing lifts many of these limitations, opening up new design capabilities that allow engineers to harness and sustain measurable advantages in durability, weight and customizability.
Traditional manufacturing faces significant limitations that impact profitability and market responsiveness. In mature economies, like the United States, manufacturers find it increasingly difficult to hire the skilled technicians required to operate the legacy equipment that powers a majority of manufacturing operations. According to a 2020 report from The Economist, the generation of specialized tool and die makers that are exiting the labor market and the emerging workforce that is replacing these individuals are trained on completely different educational foundations built on information technology and digital aptitude.
More broadly, modern manufacturing equipment and labor require complex supply chains made up of multiple hubs and nodes to function. Failure in any single supply node has the potential to compromise the entire supply chain. Digital manufacturing decouples part production from these complex systems, shortening supply chains by bringing manufacturing production onshore right at the point of need.
Additive Manufacturing has the Potential to Overcome Many of these Limitations.
Additive manufacturing as a category has the potential to overcome many of the limitations of conventional manufacturing. The new design capabilities provide significant possibilities for superior products that drive higher performance and more closely match customer preferences. The easy-to-use interface that operates our printers is more applicable to an emerging workforce that consists of digital natives trained in IT educational foundations. With additive manufacturing technology, manufacturers may now combat supply chain constraints, allowing them to respond more quickly to sharp changes in demand signals. Machines the size of microwave ovens that require no skilled labor can now help manufacturers circumvent expensive and time-consuming supply chains by printing parts when and where they are needed.
Most 3D Printing Solutions Today are Focused on Design and Prototyping Applications.
Despite the apparent benefits of additive manufacturing relative to conventional manufacturing, it has taken the industry nearly four decades to arrive at a solution that is widely adopted for applications beyond one-offs and prototypes. Part of the reason for such slow adoption is that before Markforged, there were only two limited categories of 3D printers available. Additionally, both categories were engineered as point solutions for a single factory, making distributed digital manufacturing across a network of printers cumbersome or infeasible. For these reasons, neither of these choices was appropriate for the manufacturing floor or distributed manufacturing at scale.
Markforged is Delivering the Promise of Additive Manufacturing Today.
We invented The Digital Forge, a platform designed to overcome both the constraints of conventional manufacturing as well as the limitations of legacy 3D printing solutions. Through The Digital Forge, manufacturers can produce metal and composite parts that are functionally applicable for the most demanding manufacturing applications. The parts printed on The Digital Forge are based in either a variety of metals, or a variety of continuous fibers, each providing high-strength materials for manufacturing applications. Moreover, the software that powers The Digital Forge was designed to be cloud-first. In contrast to legacy additive solutions, Markforged’s printers can be accessed and controlled from anywhere in the world and entire libraries of part inventory can be digitized and printed only when needed. This smart, simple, empowering and robust platform is designed to give engineers, designers and manufacturing professionals the power to solve their manufacturing problems today and build anything they imagine.
Our Growth Strategy
Our future growth is driven by five key strategies:
•Continue to Fuel Integrated Platform with Software Solutions. Our integrated platform is designed to scale in both capability and size over time. As we invest additional resources into the feature set of our platform, we expect to be able to solve more customer problems and applications. As we solve more problems, customers will print more parts. As we print more parts, more data will be generated, making our premium software solutions, including Simulation, Blacksmith and enterprise-grade fleet management, smarter. As our premium software solutions get smarter, we will be able to print better, more accurate parts. As we print better parts, more customers will adopt our premium software solutions, which will continue to drive this growth and improvement cycle more rapidly. 
 •Expand Customer Use Cases and Applications. As we develop printers that are faster, larger and more precise, such as the FX20, and add new industrial materials to our capabilities, we continually expand the possible use cases for our customers. We regularly release new printers, software functionality and materials that customers may apply to a variety of new problems and use cases. 
 •Drive Deeper, More Efficient Go-To-Market Coverage. As we grow our global distribution footprint and drive optimizations in our go-to-market model, we will grow our sales. 
 •Expand Position as a Trusted Brand. Due to the innovative technology that we have invented, which is addressing significant global problems in manufacturing, we have the opportunity to invest resources to build a meaningful industrial technology brand. As our brand grows, we expect to generate more organic interest in our products, lowering our cost-to-acquire customers, which will facilitate our growth and improvement cycle and help expand our business. 
 •Target Strategic M&A Opportunities. We expect to continue to grow inorganically by acquiring companies with technologies and people to complement our platform and team. 
 Our Competitive Strengths
•Markforged delivers accessible, industrial-strength parts. We offer a range of proprietary composite and metal printers and materials that address numerous industrial applications. We invented and patented the CFR composite additive manufacturing process. The capabilities that CFR enables are unmatched by our competitors, and a significant portion of our customers use our CFR materials today to replace traditionally manufactured steel and aluminum parts. Because sometimes only metal will suit the application, we offer two different types of metal 3D printers: Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) and binder jet. The Metal X, our FFF solution, is well suited to custom parts which can be too costly and can take too long to obtain with conventional metal manufacturing processes. And, once an application is ready for production, our PX100 metal binder jetting solution provides higher-throughput end-use metal parts. 
 •Markforged offers customers a clear and tangible ROI. We provide simple, cost-effective and reliable solutions to manufacture mission critical parts. With The Digital Forge platform, our customers can realize significant cost and time savings, relative to conventional manufacturing, which in turn drives purchases of incremental printers and further development of new applications. For example, one global consumer products customer that purchased its first printer in 2019 realized 45 times cost savings on a key application tool for its automated assembly line. Since the initial purchase, that customer has purchased more than 30 printers primarily focused on this application. 
 •Markforged’s integrated, modern software platform drives faster innovation. We built our entire platform on cloud-based architecture, bringing benefits traditionally confined to Software as a Service (“SaaS”) space to hardware. This architecture connects us to our customer’s printers in the field, creating a fleet of connected printers generating data to power our AI-learning algorithms that in turn guides the future development of our 3D printers with each part printed. 
 The Digital Forge
The Digital Forge is the intuitive additive manufacturing platform for modern manufacturers, bringing the power and speed of agile software development to industrial manufacturing. Composed of hardware, software and materials working as a unified platform, it is purpose-built to integrate into our customers’ existing manufacturing ecosystems and eliminate the barriers between design and functional parts. The Digital Forge adopters can achieve immediate benefits through savings of time and money on end-use parts. Through increased adoption, the platform can drive competitive advantages by making our customers’ entire operations more efficient and responsive.
3D Printers
We offer a rugged line of 3D printers all designed around one goal - empower manufacturers to print parts at the point of need. Our machines combine high build quality, intuitive user experience and broad platform connectivity to produce reliable, repeatable results.
We offer three principal categories of 3D printers and systems:
•Desktop: Our Desktop 3D Printers are precision-built professional machines designed to reliably print quality parts. These printers deliver precise results with a smaller form factor, making them ideal when space is at a premium. 
 •Industrial: Our Industrial 3D Printers provide best-in-class predictability and functionality through sensors, software, materials and print modes. 
 •Metal: Our Metal 3D Printers fabricate complex metal parts in a variety of advanced metals. 
 Materials
We offer the only industrial 3D printing family for fabricating composite, continuous fiber and metal parts on the same platform. All the materials available for printing on The Digital Forge offer a high degree of flexibility for part design and manufacturing. Our 3D printers are simple to use and do not require intensive buildouts or trained technicians. We currently offer the following materials:
•Composite: Onyx, Onyx FR, Onyx ESD, ULTEM 9085 Filament, Smooth TPU 95a, Precise PLA, and Nylon.
 •Continuous Fiber: Carbon Fiber, Carbon Fiber FR, Aramid Fiber (Kevlar®), HSHT Fiberglass, and Fiberglass.
 •Metal: 17-4 PH Stainless Steel, Copper, Inconel 625, H13 Tool Steel, and A2 and D2 Tool Steel. 
 Our customers can print the right material for the right applications. If a customer requires strength and low weight, composites can replace metal parts and accelerate production times. If customers need something to withstand high temperatures and provide wear resistance, metals can be utilized. In addition, customers can combine parts made of different materials for even higher-performing parts using the CFR process.
CFR augments traditional Fused Filament Fabrication (“FFF”) technology, enabling our printers to reinforce FFF parts with continuous fibers. A CFR-capable machine uses two extrusion systems for two unique materials: one for conventional FFF polymer filament, and a second for long strand continuous fibers. Continuous fibers are laid down in-layer, replacing FFF infill. As a result, a CFR-capable printer can print both traditional FFF-only parts or CFR parts (FFF parts reinforced with continuous fibers).
CFR represents a step-change improvement in part performance for only an incremental increase in effort. CFR parts are significantly stronger (up to 25 times stronger than ABS plastics) and can replace machined aluminum parts. The process is inherently flexible: simple enough for anyone to use and powerful enough to enable deep customization of part mechanical properties. This means that an engineer can reinforce a part with continuous fibers with two clicks of a button and customize reinforcement on a layer-by-layer basis on the same platform. With five available fibers and multiple reinforcement techniques that can be granularly configured, parts can be highly customized for applications. We believe the capabilities that CFR enables are unmatched by current alternatives.
Software
Our software pairs advanced 3D printing software with the first connected additive manufacturing platform. Our software is an integrated platform designed to help customers get from design to part quickly. It empowers users to take control of their manufacturing workflow in three ways:
•Advanced part slicing and printing. Our software is an integrated, connected platform designed to take customers from CAD to functional part quickly. The browser-based workflow is secure, fast and intuitive. Users can design parts for printing with a single click, or drill deeply into part settings to specially optimize part properties. Our software fully integrates with all of Markforged’s 3D printers, enabling customers to create builds, print parts, and monitor prints in a seamless workflow. 


•Integrated cloud part repository. A secure part library enables customers to dynamically manage engineering projects of any size. Our software’s part files are securely stored and can be versioned, edited and printed anywhere. Easy-to-use filters and folders enable customers to quickly store and find the parts they need when they need it. 
 •Real time enterprise-grade fleet management accessible through premium software subscriptions. Our premium software subscription provides a single place to manage our customers’ printer fleets in real time, whether in one spot or worldwide. Users can benefit from automatic updates while getting analytics, usage data and live telemetry. Our premium software updates automatically, unlocking new features and continuously improving printer performance. Support is fully integrated into the software experience and is directly accessible from both part and printer pages. 
 •Simulation. Incorporating 3D printing into tooling and end-use applications requires confidence in the strength of the parts. By replacing slow and costly design/print/break testing cycles with virtual testing, the Markforged Simulation software feature can enable manufacturers to expand their use of additive manufacturing into the most demanding production applications. 
 Customers
We have thousands of customers (including both direct customers and customers of our value added resellers that have purchased one or more of our products) around the world, and have printed millions of parts, meeting customer needs across the entire product development lifecycle, including prototyping, tooling, production and aftermarket spare and replacement parts. Our customers range from small and medium-sized organizations to Fortune 100 manufacturers in leading edge industries such as aerospace, military and defense, industrial automation, space exploration, healthcare and automotive who utilize our platform for mission critical end-use parts on-demand and at the point-of-need.

Our research and development team is responsible for designing, developing and enhancing our products, as well as performing product testing and quality assurance activities. Members of our research and development team specialize in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, material science, product realization and software engineering.
Research and development expense totaled $42.4 million and $32.2 million in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We expect our research and development expense to continue to increase for the foreseeable future as we enhance existing products, develop new products for current markets and introduce new products in new markets.
The majority of our research and development operations are conducted in our facility in Watertown, Massachusetts. We also maintain a design facility for our binder jetting solution located in Hoganas, Sweden.
 Sales and Marketing
We primarily sell our products and services through a global channel of third-party value-added reseller partners (“VARs”). We have approximately 100 VARs spanning the globe with over a thousand full-time employees who market, sell and support our platform. Our VAR channel allows us to have global scale, engage deeply with our customers and provide significant operating leverage to our business. We have and will continue to optimize our VAR network focused on global manufacturing.
Our global marketing team drives new customer acquisition, retention and expansion of existing customers and the demonstration and capabilities set of our products.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
Our goal is to create an excellent customer experience by shipping quality products on time and providing meaningful support after delivery, all while working safely. We work toward this goal by being selective with our resources, dedicating our focus to areas where we see a strategic advantage, and working with high quality outsourced partners to manage the rest. Our printer manufacturing operations include both our internal manufacturing facility in Billerica, Massachusetts as well as third-party contract manufacturers who source materials, manufacture components and assemble products in accordance with our specifications and quality standards. We currently source and manufacture our consumable materials, which provides flexibility, increased responsiveness and a distinct competitive advantage.
Our Competition
The industry in which we operate is fragmented and competitive. We compete for customers with a wide variety of conventional and additive manufacturing solution providers. We believe that the market is in its early phases of adoption of additive manufacturing technology, and that the potential for growth will be significant as our target customers seek more flexible, customized, software-enabled manufacturing processes to shorten their supply chains and compete globally.
We believe we compare favorably to other industry participants on the basis of the following competitive factors applicable to our products:
•cloud-based, AI-learning software platform; 
 •proprietary CFR process;

An “open door” policy is maintained at all levels of the organization and any form of retaliation against an employee is strictly prohibited.
The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the physical and mental well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees and contractors. We provide our employees with a wide range of benefits, including benefits directed to their health, safety and long-term financial security.
Intellectual Property
 
Our ability to drive innovation in the additive manufacturing market depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights, both in the United States and abroad, through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as through contractual provisions and restrictions on access to our proprietary technology which includes nondisclosure and invention assignment agreements with our consultants and employees and through non-disclosure agreements with our vendors and business partners. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in both general and product-specific terms of use. Unpatented research, development, know-how and engineering skills make an important contribution to our business, but we pursue patent protection when we believe it is possible and consistent with our overall strategy for safeguarding intellectual property.
As of December 31, 2022, we own 55 issued United States patents, 36 issued foreign patents and have 109 pending or allowed patent applications. Our patents and patent applications are directed to, among other things, additive manufacturing and related technologies.

 We have 2 issued United States trademarks and 23 issued foreign trademarks, including “Markforged” in the European Union, Australia, Canada, China, Israel, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. We have 4 pending United States trademark applications and 2 pending foreign applications.
 Government Regulations
We are subject to various laws, regulations and permitting requirements of federal, state and local authorities, including related to environmental, health and safety; anti-corruption and export controls. We believe that we are in material compliance with all such laws, regulations and permitting requirements.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to domestic and foreign environmental laws and regulations governing our operations, including, but not limited to, emissions into the air and water and the use, handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances. A certain risk of environmental liability is inherent in our production activities. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, the generation, use, storage, registration, handling and disposal of chemicals and waste materials, the presence of specified substances in electrical products, the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air or water, the cleanup of contaminated sites, including any contamination that results from spills due to our failure to properly dispose of chemicals and other waste materials and the health and safety of our employees. We are required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain operations.
The export of our products internationally from our production facilities subjects us to environmental laws and regulations concerning the import and export of chemicals and hazardous substances such as the United States Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) and the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances (“REACH”). These laws and regulations require the evaluation and registration of some chemicals that we ship along with, or that form a part of, our systems and other products.
Export and Trade Matters
We are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations imposed by governments around the world with jurisdiction over our operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, as well as the laws of the countries where we do business. We are also subject to various trade restrictions, including trade and economic sanctions and export controls, imposed by governments around the world with jurisdiction over our operations. For example, in accordance with trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and the U.S. Department of Commerce, we are prohibited from engaging in transactions involving certain persons and certain designated countries or territories. In addition, our products are subject to export regulations that can involve significant compliance time and may add additional overhead cost to our products. In recent years, the United States government has a renewed focus on export matters related to additive manufacturing. Some of our products are already more tightly controlled for export, and other of our products may in the future become more tightly controlled for export. For example, the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 and regulatory guidance thereunder have imposed additional controls and may result in the imposition of further additional controls, on the export of certain “emerging and foundational technologies.” Our current and future products may be subject to these heightened regulations, which could increase our compliance costs.
