Item 1. Business
Our Company
We are a Canadian headquartered, Delaware incorporated precious metals exploration, development and production company with the objective of becoming a leading silver producer. We were formed on February 2, 2011, when our predecessor Precious Metals Opportunities LLC, which was formed in December 2009, converted to a Delaware corporation. On March 1, 2011, Los Gatos Ltd. Merged with and into us to form Sunshine Silver Mines Corporation. In 2014, we changed our name to Sunshine Silver Mining & Refining Corporation.
In conjunction with the initial public offering (“IPO”) completed on October 30, 2020, the Company effected a reorganization (the “Reorganization”) in which (i) the Company changed its name from Sunshine Silver Mining & Refining Corporation to Gatos Silver, Inc., (ii) Silver Opportunity Partners LLC, which held the Company’s interest in the Sunshine Complex in Idaho, comprised of the Sunshine Mine and the Sunshine Big Creek Refinery, became a wholly owned subsidiary of a newly created Delaware corporation named Silver Opportunity Partners Corporation (“SOP”), (iii) all equity interest in SOP was distributed to the Company’s shareholders, and (iv) each share of the Company’s common stock was split at a ratio of two-for-one (the “Reverse Split”). The Reverse Split did not have any effect on the stated par value of the Company’s common stock and the rights and privileges of the holders of shares of Common Stock were unaffected. All common stock and options outstanding immediately prior to the Reverse Split were appropriately adjusted by dividing the number of shares of common stock into which the options are exercisable or convertible by two and multiplying the exercise or conversion price thereof by two.
Our primary efforts are focused on the operation of the LGJV in Chihuahua, Mexico. The LGJV was formed on January 1, 2015 when we entered into the Unanimous Omnibus Partner Agreement with Dowa Metals and Mining Co., Ltd. (“Dowa”) to further explore, and potentially develop and operate mining properties within the LGD. The entities comprising the LGJV are Minera Plata Real S. de R.L. de C.V. (‘‘MPR’’), Operaciones San Jose de Plata S. de R.L. de C.V (“OSJ”). (collectively, the ‘‘LGJV Entities’’), following the merger of Servicios San Jose de Plata S. de R.L. de C.V. (“Servicios”) into MPR effective July 15, 2021. The LGJV Entities own mineral rights and certain surface associated with the LGD. The LGJV ownership is currently 70% Gatos Silver and 30% Dowa. On September 1, 2019, the LGJV commenced commercial production at CLG, which produces silver containing lead concentrate and zinc concentrate. The LGJV’s lead and zinc concentrates are sold to third-party customers. Pursuant to the Unanimous Omnibus Partner Agreement, Dowa has the right to purchase 100% of the zinc concentrate produced from the CLG, at rates negotiated in good faith based on industry pricing benchmarks, and agreed between Dowa and MPR. The Unanimous Omnibus Partner Agreement currently requires unanimous partner approval of all major operating decisions (such as annual budgets, the creation of security interests on property, and certain major expenditures).
In addition to our 70% interest in the LGD, we have 100% ownership of the Santa Valeria property, located in Chihuahua, Mexico, which comprises 1,543 hectares and could provide additional opportunities for resource growth.

Our Principal Projects
We are currently focused on the production and continued development of the CLG and the further exploration and development of the LGD:

● | The CLG, located within the LGD, described below, consists of a polymetallic mine and processing facility that commenced commercial production on September 1, 2019 and currently processes over 2,800 tonnes per day (“tpd”) of ore. The Los Gatos Technical Report estimates that, as of July 1, 2022, the deposit contains approximately 6.07 million diluted tonnes of proven and probable mineral reserves (mineral reserves and mineral resources stated herein are on a 100% basis unless otherwise stated and mineral resources are stated exclusive of mineral reserves) with approximately 2.32 million diluted tonnes of proven mineral reserves and approximately 3.75 million tonnes of probable mineral reserves. Average proven and probable mineral reserve grades are 244 g/t silver, 4.48% zinc, 2.14% lead and 0.27 g/t gold. As of July 1, 2022, the measured and indicated mineral resource (exclusive of reserves) was 1.94 million tonnes grading 96 g/t silver, 3.01% zinc, 1.56% lead and 0.19 g/t gold with 0.38 million tonnes of measured resource and 1.55 million tonnes of indicated resource and the inferred mineral resource (exclusive of reserves) was 2.09 million tonnes grading 113 g/t silver, 4.30% zinc, 2.45% lead and 0.20 g/t gold at the CLG. The mineral reserve estimates contained in the Los Gatos Technical Report have an effective date of July 1, 2022 and exclude material that was mined before that effective date. From July 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022, approximately 525,000 tonnes of material was processed by the CLG mill. This processed material included mineral reserve tonnes, and to a lesser extent mineral resource tonnes as well as mineralized material not included in the mineral resource. The mineral resource estimates for the CLG have an effective date of July 1, 2022 and have not been updated since that time. The mineral resource estimates contained in the Los Gatos Technical Report are presented on an undiluted basis without adjustment for mining recovery.

● | The LGD, located in Chihuahua, Mexico, is approximately 120 kilometers south of Chihuahua City and is comprised of a 103,087 hectare land position, constituting a new mining district. The LGD consists of multiple mineralized zones. Two of the identified mineralized zones, Cerro Los Gatos and Esther have reported mineral resources. The Los Gatos Technical Report estimates that the Esther deposit contains 0.28 million tonnes of indicated mineral resources at average grades of 122 g/t silver, 4.30% zinc, 2.17% lead and 0.14 g/t gold, and 1.20 million tonnes of inferred mineral resources at average grades of 133 g/t silver, 3.69% zinc, 1.53% lead and 0.09 g/t gold. The mineral resource estimates for the Esther deposit have an effective date of July 1, 2022 and have not been updated since that time. The mineral resource estimates contained in the Los Gatos Technical Report are presented on an undiluted basis without adjustment for mining recovery. The deposits in the LGD are characterized by predominantly silver-lead-zinc epithermal mineralization. A core component of the LGJV’s business plan is to explore the highly prospective, underexplored LGD with the objective of identifying additional mineral deposits that can be developed, mined and processed, possibly utilizing the CLG plant infrastructure. The history in relation to the LGD is described below.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prior to our initial acquisition of exploration concession rights in April 2006, very limited historical prospecting and exploration activities had been conducted in the LGD. We were able to acquire mineral concessions covering 103,087 hectares and, through our exploration, discovered a virgin silver region containing potential high-grade epithermal vein-style mineralization throughout the LGD concession package. In 2008, we negotiated surface access rights with local ranch owners and obtained the environmental permits for drilling and road construction necessary for the development of the CLG. Through 2015, we purchased all the surface lands required for the CLG development. Environmental baseline data collection began in May 2010 and was completed in 2016 and approved in 2017 to prepare for the development of future environmental studies required for the CLG. In 2014, we partnered with Dowa to finance and develop the CLG and pursue exploration in the LGD and, as noted above, entered into the Unanimous Omnibus Partner Agreement in early 2015.
We believe that we have strong support from the local community, with about 195 employees from the local community working across multiple areas involving the continued underground development, construction of the surface facilities and operation of the CLG. Over 99% of the approximate 845 employees at the CLG are from Mexico, highlighting our commitment to the local workforce.

Our primary areas of focus have been operating and developing the CLG, defining and expanding the mineral reserves and mineral resources associated with the CLG and exploring and delineating resources within the LGD. As of December 31, 2022, 1,879 exploration and definition drill holes have been completed in both CLG and the LGD, totaling 449,474 meters. In 2022, LGD exploration drilling was completed at Esther, Cascabel, Wall-e and El Valle targets and detailed mapping occurred and Wall-e and Cascabel. Definition and expansion drilling was completed around CLG both from surface and underground. 
Our objectives at the CLG are to, among other things:

● | continue strong operating and cost performance;
--+------------------------------------------------


● | maximize margins and extend the LOM;
--+-------------------------------------


● | complete key capital projects and other initiatives to enhance mining efficiencies and reduce operating costs; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | perform additional in-fill and step-out drilling to convert mineral resources to reserves and delineate mineral resources and reserves from the recently discovered mineralization below the South-East zone of the CLG (“South-East Deeps”).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our objectives at the LGD are to realize the district potential through, among other things:

● | detailed mapping and drill testing at the Esther, Amapola and El Lince Area deposits;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | district mapping and geophysics in the Rio Conchos basin and additional exposed and underlying andesite in the region to identify additional drill targets; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | continued expansion of the LGJV’s interest in prospective mineral and surface rights.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the years ended December 31,2022, 2021 and 2020, the LGJV achieved the following production from CLG:

Strategic Developments
Our business strategy is focused on creating value for stakeholders through the ownership and advancement of the CLG and the LGD and through the pursuit and the development of other attractive silver-focused projects. The following outlines key strategic developments since January 1, 2021:

● | Extinguished the Los Gatos Working Capital Facility (“WCF”): On March 11, 2021, the $60 million WCF provided to the LGJV by Dowa was extinguished. The WCF carried an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus 3%. In addition, we were required to pay an arrangement fee on the borrowing, calculated as 15.0% per annum of 70.0% of the average daily principal amount outstanding during the relevant fiscal quarter. By extinguishing the WCF, we reduced the borrowing costs of the LGJV.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Repurchased an 18.5% interest in the LGJV to increase our ownership to 70.0%: On March 11, 2021, we repurchased an approximate 18.5% interest in the LGJV from Dowa, increasing our ownership to 70.0%. With increased ownership, we have and expect to further benefit from the production at the CLG, supported by the expected cash flow generation profile of the operation. In addition to increasing our economic interest in the CLG, this repurchase also provides us with greater exposure to potential upside from additional exploration within the LGD.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Extinguished the Dowa Term Loan: On July 26, 2021, the Term Loan provided to the LGJV by Dowa was extinguished. The Term Loan carried an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.35%. In addition, we were required to pay an arrangement fee on the borrowing, calculated as 2.0% per annum of 70.0% of the outstanding principal balance.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Secured a Revolving Credit Facility (the “Credit Facility”): On July 12, 2021, we entered into the Credit Facility with Bank of Montreal (“BMO”) that provides for a $50 million revolving line of credit with an accordion feature. On March 7, 2022, we amended the Credit Facility with BMO, to address potential loan covenant deficiencies, which resulted, inter alia, in the credit limit being reduced to $30 million until the Company delivered a new LOM CLG financial model with updated mineral reserves and waivers of certain defaults, events of default, representations and warranties and covenants arising out of the facts that led to the potential reduction in metal content of the Company’s previously stated mineral reserve figures.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On December 19, 2022, we entered into an amended and restated Credit Facility with BMO extending the maturity date and re-establishing a credit limit of $50 million, with an accordion feature.

● | Demonstrated Excellent Operational Performance. For 2022, we reported record silver production at the CLG, exceeding our 2022 guidance. Silver production was 10.3 million ounces in 2022, up 36% from 7.6 million ounces in 2021, and above the high-end of the most recent 2022 guidance range of 9.35 million to 9.65 million ounces. Zinc, lead and gold production also increased during 2022, with zinc and gold near the high-end of guidance, and lead near the guidance midpoint. Compared with 2021, zinc production increased by 22%, lead production by 10%, and gold production by 2%. The higher silver production for the year ended 2022 was primarily due to higher silver ore grades and higher mill throughput rates. Production sequencing in 2022 was from the highest-grade sections of the orebody, as considered in the LOM plan included in the Los Gatos Technical Report. We expect to produce 7.4 to 8.2 million ounces of silver, 57 to 63 million pounds of zinc, 36 to 40 million pounds of lead and 5.4 thousand to 6.2 thousand ounces of gold in 2023.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Optimization of Assets and Capital Improvements. Mill throughput averaged 2,847 tpd during the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of 9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 and significantly exceeding the mill design rate of 2,500 tpd. During 2022 the mill achieved a record 2,662 tpd, which was 7% higher than in 2021. Silver, zinc and lead recoveries for the year ended 2022 were also higher than in 2021. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we completed the construction and commissioning of the CLG paste plant and three production stopes were successfully filled with paste backfill by December 31, 2022. The paste plant is expected to increase operational flexibility and productivity as well as help to lower operating costs going forward. Construction of the CLG zinc concentrate leach plant is progressing well and is expected to be commissioned in the second quarter of 2023. The concentrate leach plant is expected to reduce the amount of deleterious content in zinc concentrates being sent to Dowa. As agreed with Dowa, the initial payment towards the priority payment due to them was reduced to reflect a portion of both the construction and future estimated operating costs of the new leaching plant, subject to the successful construction and operation of the plant. The LGJV expects to spend $45 million on sustaining capital during 2023 of which $25 million is expected to be incurred on underground development to access the lower levels of the Northwest and central zones and to further develop to the Southeast zone. The remainder of capital expenditures for 2023 is expected to be primarily associated with equipment replacements and rebuilds, dewatering infrastructure, and for completion of the fluorine leach plant for zinc concentrates which we expect to commission during the second quarter of 2023.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Discovery of South-East Deeps zone at CLG. In 2022, through the LGJV, we discovered mineralization below the South-East zone of the CLG. This newly identified zone extends approximately 415 meters below the reported mineral reserve.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Additional Strategic Developments in 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we completed a full re-estimation of the Company’s mineral resource and mineral reserve with published 2022 Technical Reports. The mineral resources and mineral reserves were completely rebuilt from base data, including data compilation of surface drilling, underground drilling, underground mapping and production data, comprehensive data validation, structural and geological interpretation, resource estimation, reconciliation to actual production, and a new mine design including updates to operating and capital costs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We also relocated our corporate office from Denver, Colorado to Vancouver, British Columbia providing improved access to experienced mining managerial talent and strengthened the executive management team including appointments of a Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, and Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Technical Services, all with extensive experience working for larger multinational companies. In 2022, the LGJV paid three dividends to its partners during 2022, totaling $55 million, of which the Company’s share was $29.3 million, net of withholding taxes and after initial priority dividend payments to Dowa.
We believe the following provide us with significant competitive advantages:

● | Our Assets are High Quality: As noted above, the CLG achieved strong operational performance in 2021 with further improvements in 2022. Per the Los Gatos Technical Report, the CLG is expected to produce an average of 7.4 million ounces of silver per annum at low LOM all-in-sustaining-costs over the LOM.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our Assets are Located in Established Mining Region: The CLG and the LGD are located in one of the world’s premier silver mining regions: the Mexican Silver Belt, which was the world’s largest silver producing region in 2021. Mexico is highly ranked among silver mining jurisdictions worldwide and has a long history of successful mineral development and operations. We have access to experienced and capable mining employees in Mexico.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Further optimization potential at CLG: At the CLG, we apply continuous improvement practices designed to reduce costs, and improve throughput and recoveries. For example, during 2023 we are completing a scoping study on the possible expansion of the grinding circuit to 3,500 tpd to better utilize the capacity in the existing flotation circuit.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Growth Potential in our Mineral Reserves and Resources from Further Exploration of the CLG and the LGD: Through the LGJV, we have continued our in-mine and near-mine exploration program in the CLG and our exploration activities in the LGD. In the CLG, we expect to convert inferred resources from higher-grade areas located adjacent to planned mine development. We expect there to be further LOM extension opportunity in the South-East Deeps area of the CLG. We also believe the LGD is a highly-prospective area with 103,087 contiguous hectares of mineral rights. The LGD is located in the Mexican Silver Belt, a geologic zone that hosts numerous significant silver producing operations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The LGD represents an underexplored property within this productive belt, where there has been little historical workings or previous exploration. On November 22, 2022 we disclosed our exploration strategy for the LGD which entails a focus on two key areas: an exposed section of andesite running from the northwest boundary of the district to Esther and the CLG, and a large basin southeast of the CLG underlain by andesite and which we anticipate may contain other large district-scale fault structures conducive to large deposits. We are currently prioritizing exploration efforts on areas closer to the CLG and areas with the highest potential to leverage existing surface and underground infrastructure. We expect to incur drilling and exploration expenditures of approximately $13 million in 2023.At the CLG there is currently five active drill rigs on surface and three underground, with the primary focus being on CLG life extension including drilling of the South-East Deeps zone and gradually shifting focus towards exploration drilling of the LGD in the second half of 2023. We also plan to conduct detailed mapping of the district and undertake a geophysics program aiming to define structures and future drilling targets across the property. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Management Team and Board of Directors are Highly Experienced: We have an experienced management team with a track record of successfully identifying, financing and developing mineral discoveries. Our Chief Executive Officer, Dale Andres; Chief Financial Officer, André van Niekerk; Senior Vice President of Evaluations and Technical Services, Tony Scott; and General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer, Stephen Bodley, each has significant experience in effectuating, operating and improving successful mining projects. Our Board of Directors is comprised of senior mining, financial and business executives who have broad domestic and international experience in mineral exploration, development and mining operations. Our Board of Directors has been established with individuals who have career backgrounds at notable mining companies. We believe that the specialized skills and knowledge of the management team and of the Board of Directors will significantly enhance our ability to cost-effectively operate the CLG and extend its LOM, to explore and develop the LGD and to pursue other growth opportunities.

1. | Mineral Resources are reported on a 100% basis and are exclusive of Mineral Reserves.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Mineral Resources, which are not Mineral Reserves, do not have demonstrated economic viability. The estimate of Mineral Resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, marketing, or other relevant issues.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | The SEC definitions for Mineral Resources in S-K 1300 were used for Mineral Resource classification which are consistent with Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (CIM (2014) definitions).
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | The quantity and grade of reported Inferred Mineral Resources in this estimation are uncertain in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to define these Inferred Mineral Resources as an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource. It is uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading Inferred Mineral Resources to an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource category.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Specific gravity has been assumed on a dry basis.
---+--------------------------------------------------


6. | Tonnage and contained metal have been rounded to reflect the accuracy of the estimate and numbers may not sum exactly.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7. | Mineral Resources exclude all Mineral Resource material mined prior to July 1, 2022.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


8. | Mineral Resources are reported within stope shapes using a $42/tonne or $52/tonne NSR cut-off basis depending on mining method with an Ag price of $22/oz, Zn price of $1.20/lb, Pb price of $0.90/lb and Au price of $1,700/oz. The metal prices used for the Mineral Resource are based on the three-year trailing prices from June 2019 to June 2020 and long-term analyst consensus estimates for the LOM.

Competition
There is aggressive competition within the mining and precious metals industry. We compete with other precious metals mining companies, as well as other mineral miners, in efforts to obtain financing to explore and develop projects. Many of these mining companies currently have greater resources than we do. In the future, we may compete with such companies to acquire additional properties.
In addition, we also encounter competition for the hiring of key personnel. The mining industry is currently facing a shortage of experienced mining professionals, particularly experienced mine construction and mine management personnel. This competition affects our operations. Larger regional companies can offer better employment terms than smaller companies such as us.
We also compete for the services of mine service companies, such as project coordinators and drilling companies. Potential suppliers may choose to provide better terms and scheduling to larger companies in the industry due to the scale and scope of their operations.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
We are subject to stringent and complex environmental laws, regulations and permits in the jurisdiction in which we operate. These requirements are a significant consideration for us as our operations involve, or may in the future involve, among other things, the removal, extraction and processing of natural resources, emission and discharge of materials into the environment, remediation of soil and groundwater contamination, workplace health and safety, reclamation and closure of waste impoundments and other properties, and handling, storage, transport and disposal of wastes and hazardous materials. Compliance with these laws, regulations and permits can require substantial capital or operating costs or otherwise delay, limit or prohibit our development or future operation of our properties. These laws, regulations and permits, and the enforcement and interpretation thereof, change frequently and generally have become more stringent over time. If we violate these environmental requirements, we may be subject to litigation, fines or other sanctions, including the revocation of permits and suspension of operations. Pursuant to such requirements, we also may be subject to inspections or reviews by governmental authorities.
Permits and Approvals
We were issued the major government approvals required to construct and operate the CLG facilities during 2017. While there are multiple approvals from multiple levels of government, the key government approval for the project is the MIA (Environmental Impact Assessment), issued in July 2017 and valid until 2041. As the mine plan changes, it may be necessary to conduct environmental studies and collect and present to governmental authorities data pertaining to the potential impact that our current or future operations may have upon the environment. Since the original MIA approval was granted in 2017, we have successfully achieved three amendments to the MIA approval to reflect changes to the mine plan and facilities. 
We have the approvals necessary to extract the mineral reserve as described in the Los Gatos Technical Report with the exception of the operation of the fluorine leach project which was submitted for assessment during 2022. While there is no certainty on when or if the amendment will be successful, the rejection of this project would not be expected to materially impact economics of the CLG operation.

Hazardous Substances and Waste Management
We could be liable for environmental contamination at or from our or our predecessors’ currently or formerly owned or operated properties or third-party waste disposal sites. Certain environmental laws impose joint and several strict liability for releases of hazardous substances at such properties or sites, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. A generator of waste can be held responsible for contamination resulting from the treatment or disposal of such waste at any off-site location (such as a landfill), regardless of whether the generator arranged for the treatment or disposal of the waste in compliance with applicable laws. Costs associated with liability for removal or remediation of contamination or damage to natural resources could be substantial and liability under these laws may attach without regard to whether the responsible party knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the contaminants. In addition to potentially significant investigation and remediation costs, such matters can give rise to claims from governmental authorities and other third parties for fines or penalties, natural resource damages, personal injury and property damage.
Mine Health and Safety Laws
All of our current properties are located in Mexico and are subject to regulation by the Political Constitution of the United Mexican States, and are subject to various legislation in Mexico, including the Mining Law, the Federal Law of Waters, the Federal Labor Law, the Federal Law of Firearms and Explosives, the General Law on Ecological Balance and Environmental Protection and the Federal Law on Metrology Standards, as well as the accompanying regulations and regulatory authorities. Mining, environmental and labor authorities may inspect our operations on a regular basis and issue various citations and orders when they believe a violation has occurred under the relevant statute. Regulations and the results of inspections may have a significant effect on our operating costs.
At this time, it is not possible to predict the full effect that the new or proposed statutes, regulations and policies will have on our operating costs, but it may increase our costs and those of our competitors.
Other Environmental Laws
We are required to comply with numerous other environmental laws, regulations and permits in addition to those previously discussed. These additional requirements include, for example, various permits regulating road construction and drilling at the Mexican properties.
We endeavor to conduct our mining operations in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. However, because of extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements, violations during mining operations occur from time to time in the industry.
Facilities and Employees
We own and lease land at our other exploration properties in Mexico and at the LGD through our ownership interest in the LGJV.
As of January 31, 2023, we had two full-time employees in the United States, twelve full time employees in Canada and eight full-time employees in Mexico, and the LGJV had approximately 839 employees in Mexico. The LGJV had approximately 597 unionized employees in December 2022. We believe that our employee relations are good and plan to continue to hire employees as our operations expand at the LGJV. The health and safety of our employees and the employees of the LGJV is our highest priority, consistent with our business culture and values. In addition to tracking common lagging indicators, such as injury performance, we focus on leading indicators such as high potential incidents and safety observations, as well as other proactive actions taken at site to ensure worker safety. We are committed to operating in accordance with high ethical standards and believe this is a key motivational factor for our employees. In 2022, we updated our Code of Conduct as well as other core compliance policies and conducted training and compliance certification with all our employees and the employees of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. We continue to emphasize employee development and training to empower employees both at the corporate level and at the LGJV level to enhance employees’ potential and benefit the business. We leverage both formal and informal programs to identify, foster, and retain top talent at both the corporate and the LGJV level.
