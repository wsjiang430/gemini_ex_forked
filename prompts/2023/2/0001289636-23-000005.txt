Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a technology company providing solutions that enhance the efficiency, safety, and reliability of industrial combustion appliances while mitigating potential environmental impacts related to the operation of these devices. Our legacy business is primarily focused in the upstream, midstream, and downstream transmission segments of the oil and gas industry. However, in recent years, we have completed many installations of our burner-management solutions in other industries that we believe will be applicable as we expand our addressable market over time. We specialize in the engineering and design of burner and combustion management systems and solutions used on a variety of natural and forced draft applications. We sell our products and services primarily throughout North America. Our experienced team of sales and service professionals are strategically positioned across the United States and Canada providing support and service for our products.
Principal Products and Services
Across the energy industry, there are numerous demands for heat generation and control. Applications such as combustors, enclosed flares, gas production units, treaters, glycol and amine reboilers, indirect line-heaters, heated tanks, and process heaters require heat to support the production and or processing function. This heat is generated through the process of combustion, which must be controlled, managed, and supervised. Combustion and the resulting generation of heat are integral to the process of separating, treating, storing, incinerating, and transporting oil and gas. Factors such as specific gravity, the presence of hydrates, temperature and hydrogen sulfide content contribute to the need for heat generation in oil and gas production and processing applications. Our burner-management systems ignite, monitor, and manage pilot and burner systems that are utilized in this process. Our technology affords remote operation, reducing the need for employee interaction with the appliance's burner for purposes such as re-ignition or temperature monitoring. In addition, our burner-management systems can help reduce emissions by safely reigniting a failed flame, thereby improving efficiencies and up-time. Our extensive service and combustion experience provides customers with solutions that are consistent with industry trends and regulatory requirements to mitigate environmental impacts and reduce emissions through optimized burner operation. 
Oil and gas companies, including upstream, midstream, downstream, pipeline, and gathering operators, utilize burner-management systems to achieve increased safety, greater operational efficiencies, and improved compliance with industry regulations. Without a burner-management system, a field employee must discover and reignite an extinguished burner flame, then restart the application manually. Therefore, without a proper burner-management system, all application monitoring must be accomplished in-person, directly on-site. This requirement for on-site monitoring, in an operational environment with limited field personnel, can result in the potential interruption of production for long periods of time and increased risks associated with reigniting a flame, which can lead to site hazards, including explosions and the possibility of venting gas into the atmosphere. In addition, without a burner-management system, burners often operate for longer durations, frequently with lower efficiency, resulting in increased equipment fatigue and greater expense related to fuel consumption. 
We continue to assess regulatory requirements applicable to our customers. We believe our burner-management systems and services offer solutions for customers to meet compliance standards where applicable. In addition to product sales, we dispatch specialized service technicians to provide maintenance and installation support throughout the United States and Canada. 
We initially developed our first burner-management controller in 2005. Since that time, our systems have become widely adopted throughout the United States and Western Canada. Profire burner-management systems have been designed to comply with widely accepted safety and industrial codes and standards in North America, including those prescribed and certified by the Canadian Standards Association (CSA), Underwriters Laboratories (UL), and Safety Integrity Level (SIL) standards. 
Our systems and solutions have been widely adopted by exploration and production companies (E&P), midstream operators, pipeline operators, as well as downstream transmission and utility providers. Our customers include, Antero, ATCO, Chevron, CNRL, Concho Resources, Devon Energy, Dominion Energy, EQT, Kinder Morgan, National Grid, Ovintiv, Oxy, Range Resources, Williams, XTO, and others. Our systems have also been sold and installed in other parts of the world including many countries in South America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Though firmly established and primarily focused on North American oil and gas markets, we continue to invest in expansion efforts in developing sales in diversified industries where our combustion technology can be utilized.
Environmental, Social and Governance Focus
As guiding principles and core to our strategy, our products and solutions are developed with a focus on safety, environmental impacts, reliability, and efficiency. Protecting human life, protecting the environment, and protecting our customers’ investments are essential to our business objectives. Our products play a crucial role in supporting our customers’ existing and future initiatives regarding improving workplace safety and environmental impacts.
Our burner-management technology is designed to monitor, operate, and manage a wide array of complex industrial heat-applications. Providing our customers with safety-approved and certified technology, purposefully designed and built to meet regulatory requirements and process needs, is a critical component of our customers’ safety protocols and initiatives.
Proper burner and combustion management control, coupled with peripheral solutions, increase site and location safety while reducing emissions. Profire technology and solutions are integrated into a variety of applications to significantly reduce the release of methane and volatile organic compounds into the environment. 
Profire burner-management controls and complementary solutions provide users with the ability to monitor field equipment remotely. This reduces truck rolls and the need for field personnel to travel to and manually inspect burner malfunctions in remote sites and locations. By dramatically reducing the number and frequency of physical trips to site, our automated solutions help our customers improve safety, reduce emissions, and decrease operating costs. 
Operator safety is at the heart of our burner-management solution technology. Integration of our solutions and products helps our customers increase the likelihood that their employees return home safe each day. Adding greater physical distance between humans and the combustion process, as well as ensuring gas supplies are properly shut off when no flame is present, are two of the critical elements of how our burner-management solutions help protect human life.
Principal Markets and Distribution Methods
Our principal market is the oil and gas industry of the United States and Western Canada, specifically, the Permian, Marcellus, Niobrara, Bakken, STACK, SCOOP and Eagle Ford US basins as well as the Duvernay and Montney and other formations located in Canada. We place a strong emphasis on developing and fostering direct relationships with end users on many fronts including environmental, health and safety, automation, engineering, and field operations leaders and team members. 
Due to the nature of our legacy business, we collaborate with and sell to many Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) who build production, processing, and heating equipment as well as other strategic partners that deliver Instrumentation and Electrical (I&E) services in the industry. These channels provide us with a relatively easy-to-scale augmentation to our sales and service teams. 
Leveraging our core technology, platforms and combustion expertise, we have started to achieve success and complete projects in new diversified markets. Through direct sales, new OEM and strategic re-sell relationships, we have found opportunities to diversify our market footprint and expand into industries that reside outside of our traditional oil and gas segments. Some industries of focus include biogas, biomass, power generation, agriculture, heat treat and metal manufacturing, mining, hydrogen production and petrochemical. 
Competition
Profire has several competitors including ACL, Combustex, SureFire, and Platinum. These companies offer similar products and services to Profire, but at a smaller scale. While price is a significant method of competition within the oil and gas industry, we believe the most important competitive factors are performance, quality, reliability, durability, product support and service expertise. We believe a quality-focused approach will support us in remaining competitive. 
Through our develop of products with enhanced capabilities, we have begun to compete with companies such as Honeywell Thermal, Emerson, Fireye, and Siemens in connection with larger, more complex applications. As we continue to expand further into downstream oil and gas applications and outside of traditional oil and gas markets, we expect this competition to intensify.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
We operate under release date purchase orders with the majority of our suppliers, including our international-based supply chain. This allows for our procurement team to work closely with our suppliers to navigate market fluctuations and the changing needs of our customers. In the past, we have not experienced any sudden or dramatic increase in the prices of the major parts or components needed for our systems. However, as industry activity levels fluctuate and global economic pressures change, we have experienced upward pressure on the prices of system components, which may persist for some time.
Some of the components that we resell, such as some of our valve products, are available from a limited number of suppliers. If our access to such products becomes constricted, we could experience a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Many of the component parts we use are relatively low-priced and historically have been readily available through multiple suppliers and manufacturers; however, we have seen sudden and dramatic increases in the price as well as decreases in supply of some of these components. The persistence of these pressures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We have been proactively working with additional contract manufacturers and vendors to reduce these supply chain risks and have been combating the prices increases with increased prices on the products we sell to our customers. 
We utilize third-party contract manufacturers, to assemble our burner-management system controllers, along with other proprietary products. We believe this has provided us with improved manufacturing efficiencies. Additionally, the use of third-party fabricators enables us to concentrate our capital on liquidity maintenance, research and development projects, and other strategies that align with our core competencies instead of investments in manufacturing equipment. Under the direction of our product engineers, the manufacturers are able to procure all electronic parts, specialty cases and components, and from those components assemble the complete system. Using specialty equipment and processes provided by us, our control systems are tested on-site by the manufacturer, and if the finished product is acceptable, it is shipped to us for distribution. We subsequently perform our own quality-control testing and ensure the programming for each system is ready for the anticipated environment of the customer. Shipments to us from our manufacturers are usually limited to a few hundred units at a time, so that in the event any one shipment is lost or damaged, inventory levels are not seriously impacted. The entire manufacturing process is typically completed within 90 to 120 days of the manufacturer receiving our purchase order and having all the necessary components on-hand. Due to global supply chain challenges over the past two years, we have experienced significant increases to some of the long lead time components used in our systems.
Our burner-management system manufacturers are located in Alberta, Canada. 
We believe we have adequate alternative manufacturing sources available if we lose the services of our current manufacturers. While such a loss might result in a temporary short-term disruption, we do not expect it would result in a materially adverse impact on our ability to meet demand for our products or results of operations, financial condition and cash flows for a significant period of time. We periodically evaluate alternative manufacturing options to ensure our current fabricators are competitive in price, manufacturing quality and fulfillment speed, and to ensure we have the ability to scale our production levels based on customer demand and market conditions.
Dependence upon Major Customers
During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues. Nonetheless, the loss of a major customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We have filed or acquired several patent applications for various product innovations. We intend to continue to assess the strategic and financial value of each potential patent as we develop various intellectual properties. 
While our patents and patent applications as a group are important, we do not consider any patent or applications to be of such importance that the loss or expiration thereof would have a material adverse effect on our business.
Need for Governmental Approval of our Principal Products or Services
We are required to obtain certain safety certifications/ratings for our combustion-management systems before they are released to the market. We have received the appropriate certifications including CSA, Intertek, and UL certifications for our burner-management systems.
Although sales of our products and services have not been dependent on industry regulations, we believe industry regulations have enhanced our sales environment in certain geographies. We believe that increased regulation in the areas of lower emissions and higher safety standards for our customers—especially when coupled with consistent enforcement—may influence potential customers to purchase our products or services and could even increase quantities purchased by existing customers.
Effects of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulation on our Business
We believe that our products and services can help our customers achieve and maintain regulatory compliance and in some instances, exceed industry standards, regarding emissions, safe burner ignition methods, data logging, or other safety or environmental compliance requirements or standards that may impact our customers and markets. Examples of such regulations include:
•B149.3-10, which has evolved in recent years and is effective for Alberta, Canada, governs the safety precautions that must be met concerning the ignition of the pilot and the main burner in Alberta. It requires a programmable control to be used if the controller complies with certain certification requirements promulgated by the CSA.
•Regulation 7 of the Air Quality Control Commission regulations in Colorado requires that combustion devices be equipped with an auto-igniter which will automatically attempt to relight the pilot flame in the combustion chamber of a control device. The auto-igniter requirement is to reduce the risk of volatile organic compound emissions. 
•R307-503, as passed by the Utah Department of Air Quality, mandates that all open and enclosed flares have an auto-igniter designed to automatically attempt to relight the pilot flame of a flare in order to combust volatile organic compound emissions.
•Order 25417, in North Dakota, requires producers to condition crude oil before transportation and prove oil temperature is above 110 degrees Fahrenheit, to burn off toxic gases from the oil.
Our burner-management systems help companies comply with these regulations and other clean air and emissions reduction initiatives and requirements. On behalf of our customers, we monitor regulatory requirements that impact their businesses and industries. We are currently monitoring the impact of the Methane Waste Prevention Act of 2021, the Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator Act, EPA New Source Performance Standards as part of 40 CFR Subpart OOOO and OOOOa, and others. We believe our burner-management systems and ancillary products can help customers meet the more stringent standards being proposed. We have assigned sales and service professionals to specific geographic areas to ensure we have a strong presence in the states and provinces with specific safety and emissions regulations.
We are focused on providing products and services that exceed existing regulatory and industry safety standards. We believe demand for our products may increase as regulators and our customers continue to tighten safety and efficiency standards in the industry and as our customers demand technological solutions. In addition to satisfying regulatory and safety requirements, we believe our customers continue to recognize the operational efficiencies that can be realized through the use of our burner-management systems and related products. However, significant changes in the regulatory environment could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition in either positive or negative ways depending on the nature of the change. 
Research and Development
We place strong emphasis on product-oriented research and development relating to the development of new or improved products and systems. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we spent $1,432,000 and $1,120,080, respectively, on research and development programs.
Cost and Effects of Compliance with Federal, State and Local Environmental Laws
Our business is affected by local, provincial, state, federal and foreign laws and other regulations relating to the gas and electric safety standards and codes presently existing in the oil and gas industry, as well as laws and regulations relating to worker safety and environmental protection.
During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, we did not incur material direct costs to comply with applicable environmental laws. There can be no assurance, however, that this will continue to be the case in the future as environmental laws and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry are routinely subject to change.
Corporate Structure
We were incorporated on May 5, 2003 in the State of Nevada. We have four wholly-owned subsidiaries: Profire Combustion, Inc., an Alberta, Canada corporation; Prochem, ULC, an Alberta, Canada unlimited liability corporation; Profire Holdings, LLC, a Utah limited liability company; and Midflow Services, an Ohio limited liability company. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 107 employees, 103 of whom were full-time employees.
