Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of next generation targeted therapies for women’s cancers. Our team has spent the past decade characterizing the structure and function of the estrogen receptor, or ER, a key driver of breast cancer in approximately 75% of patients, in order to develop more potent, oral therapies that completely inactivate this signaling pathway. Our lead product candidate, OP-1250, is a novel oral therapy with combined activity as both a complete ER antagonist, or CERAN, and a selective ER degrader, or SERD, which we believe will drive deeper, more durable responses than existing therapies. OP-1250, both as a monotherapy and in combination with inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6, or CDK4/6, demonstrated robust anti-tumor activity in a range of preclinical xenograft models of breast cancer, including in ESR1 and PIK3CA mutations and central nervous system, or CNS, metastasis. In August 2020, we initiated an ongoing Phase 1/2 monotherapy dose escalation and expansion study evaluating OP-1250 for the treatment of recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic ER-positive, or ER+, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, or HER2-, breast cancer. We reported initial data from the Phase 1a dose escalation portion of this study in November 2021, which provided proof-of-concept for OP-1250 as a monotherapy treatment for ER+/HER2- breast cancer. We reported additional monotherapy data from the Phase 1b dose expansion portion of this study in October 2022 and initiated the Phase 2 portion of the study. In 2022, we also initiated Phase 1b/2 dose escalation and expansion studies evaluating OP-1250 in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors palbociclib and ribociclib and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase alpha, or PI3Ka inhibitor, alpelisib. In December 2022, we reported initial data from the Phase 1a dose escalation portion of the study in combination with palbociclib which demonstrated attractive combinability including no drug-drug interaction, or DDI, between the two agents. In July 2022, we were granted Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for OP-1250 for patients with ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer that has progressed following one or more lines of endocrine therapy with at least one line given in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. Based on the clinical results we have achieved to date, we are advancing OP-1250 through to late-stage clinical development both as a monotherapy and in combination with other targeted agents. We own worldwide development and commercialization rights to OP-1250. We believe OP-1250’s oral formulation and dual mechanism of action directly address the limitations of current endocrine therapies, such as fulvestrant and tamoxifen, and position OP-1250 as a potential endocrine therapy of choice for the treatment of ER+ breast cancers. Our goal is to transform the standard of care for women living with cancers by developing more effective therapies that apply our deep understanding and collective expertise in endocrine-driven cancers, nuclear receptor activities and mechanisms of acquired resistance.
We are initially focused on developing therapies for the treatment of breast cancer, which represents approximately 30% of all new diagnoses of cancer in women. In 2022, the American Cancer Society, or ACS, estimated there were approximately 288,000 new cases of female breast cancer and over 43,250 deaths from metastatic breast cancer in the United States. Treatment decisions are based on a combination of individual patient characteristics and tumor biology, most importantly the expression of three proteins: ER, progesterone receptor, or PR, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, or HER2. Approximately 75% of all breast cancers are ER+, and approximately 68% are HR+/HER2-, highlighting the central role of the ER in driving a large majority of breast cancer. Approximately 6-10% of breast cancer patients present with metastatic disease at diagnosis and a further 20-30% of patients initially diagnosed with early-stage disease ultimately develop metastatic disease. The current five-year survival rate for patients with ER+ metastatic breast cancer is approximately 30%. In 2020, the breast cancer therapy market totaled $22.3 billion, and it is set to grow at a CAGR of 8.7%, reaching $51.3 billion in 2030. All key breast cancer populations will experience strong sales growth. We expect sales in the HR+/HER2- population to rise from $11.3 billion in 2020 to $30.6 billion in 2030.

The ER is a nuclear receptor that functions as a ligand regulated transcription factor. When bound to estrogen, the ER directs the expression of genes that are essential for breast cancer cells’ survival and proliferation. For more than four decades, researchers have been developing new approaches and therapies to prevent activation of the ER pathway, thereby inhibiting the ability of the ER to drive tumor cell growth. In 1977, the first endocrine therapeutic, the anti-estrogen tamoxifen, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of breast cancer. Tamoxifen is still commonly used today but is challenged by the development of acquired drug resistance, which in some cases may be due to its partial agonist activity. In search for a different mechanism to target the estrogen pathway, aromatase inhibitors, or AIs, were developed in the 1990s to block the synthesis of estrogen and deprive the ER+ cells of its activating ligand. However, up to 50% of patients taking AIs develop arthralgia, leading to suspension of treatment in up to 15% of patients. Additionally, most patients with metastatic breast cancer have been shown to ultimately develop resistance to AIs, the most common of which is the development of a ligand-independent activating mutation in the estrogen receptor gene, ESR1. AIs are also not used to treat pre-menopausal women without the addition of ovarian suppression.
In 2002, fulvestrant was approved as a treatment for hormone receptor positive, or HR+, metastatic breast cancer patients and is typically used as a second- or third-line endocrine agent. Fulvestrant was designed to be a CERAN, and later discovered to also be a SERD, and represented a breakthrough for the field with improved outcomes for patients whose disease had progressed on prior endocrine therapy. However, fulvestrant has several limitations including its suboptimal drug exposure and route of administration as a monthly intramuscular injection. Despite these drawbacks, fulvestrant achieved worldwide sales of over $1.1 billion in 2019.
More recently, the field has focused on the discovery and development of oral agents that have fulvestrant’s dual mechanism of action to completely inactivate and degrade the ER. Some of these oral SERD agents are CERANs, such as OP-1250, but others have partial agonist activity despite being SERDs and thus are not CERANs. These agents can be considered selective ER modulators, or SERM/SERDs. SERM/SERDs reduce the levels of the ER but they do not entirely eliminate it. Notably, naturally-occurring estrogen itself leads to ER degradation when binding the ER.
We designed our lead product candidate, OP-1250, based both on a detailed structural understanding of the ER and on known alterations to this structure induced by fulvestrant and other ligands. We have demonstrated in nonclinical studies that OP-1250 functions both as a CERAN and a SERD, but is distinguished from fulvestrant in several noteworthy ways, including:

● | OP-1250 is orally bioavailable while fulvestrant is a highly insoluble compound that must be administered monthly by intramuscular injection into the buttocks;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | OP-1250 has favorable biodistribution properties leading to significantly higher drug concentrations in the plasma and tumor than those achieved with fulvestrant; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | OP-1250 has demonstrated the ability to shrink tumors in head-to-head nonclinical studies with fulvestrant, in contrast to fulvestrant, which has only been shown to inhibit tumor growth.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on these differences, we believe that OP-1250 has the potential to demonstrate clinical outcomes superior to fulvestrant. Furthermore, OP-1250 has the potential to benefit patients with metastatic breast cancer, initially for patients who have previously received endocrine therapy, as well as those who are treatment naïve in the metastatic setting, and advance into the adjuvant setting for early-stage ER+ breast cancer. In multiple nonclinical animal models of anti-cancer activity, including patient-derived xenografts with tumors containing activating mutations in the ER, OP-1250 monotherapy led to tumor shrinkage or in some cases tumor eradication, as well as long-term post-treatment survival. In each of these nonclinical models, the effect of OP-1250 was superior to that of fulvestrant, an effect which we determined was driven both by improved pharmacokinetics, or PK, properties, and higher plasma and tumor drug concentrations. In nonclinical studies, OP-1250 demonstrated robust CNS penetration, and in an intracranial breast cancer brain metastases xenograft study, OP-1250 demonstrated the ability to shrink tumors and improve survival in mice. OP-1250 has

the potential to address a critical unmet medical need as 10-15% of ER+ breast cancer patients develop brain metastases for which there are currently limited treatment options. In addition, we believe that combining OP-1250 with HER2 targeted agents may represent an opportunity to improve upon recent advancements in the treatment of CNS disease in patients that express both ER and HER2, as up to 50% of patients with metastatic HER2+ breast cancer develop CNS disease, and the majority of patients with HER2+ breast cancer also express ER. In nonclinical studies, the addition of OP-1250 to HER2 inhibitors improved tumor growth inhibition in both ER+/HER2+ cell line-derived xenograft and patient-derived xenograft models.
As summarized in our pipeline figure below, our plan is to develop our wholly-owned lead product candidate, OP-1250, in a number of ER+ breast cancer indications, both as a monotherapy and in combination with approved targeted therapies that have shown improved outcomes with other endocrine therapies.

​
In August 2020, we initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical study of OP-1250 in patients with recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer whose disease has progressed on endocrine therapy. Phase 1a consisted of monotherapy dose escalation to evaluate the safety and PK of OP-1250 and to determine the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose, or RP2D. In November 2021, we reported interim Phase 1a data, with OP-1250 demonstrating attractive PK with oral bioavailability and dose-proportional exposures supporting once daily dosing; favorable tolerability with no maximum tolerated dose defined, and no clinically significant bradycardia, ocular toxicity or diarrhea; and evidence of single-agent activity in patients who had advanced on multiple prior therapies in the advanced setting, including CDK4/6 inhibitors, and confirmed partial responses in patients with baseline estrogen receptor 1, or ESR1, activating mutations.
In 2022, we completed enrollment in our Phase 1b dose expansion at two dose levels (60 mg and 120 mg daily) and selected 120 mg daily as our RP2D to advance into Phase 2 efficacy evaluation. Phase 2 efficacy

evaluation initiated in the second half of 2022 with approximately 80 patients expected to be enrolled across three cohorts: patients with measurable disease (n=50), patients with non-measurable disease (n=15), and patients with CNS metastasis (n=15). The first two primary cohorts, patients with measurable disease and patients with non-measurable disease, were fully enrolled in the fourth quarter of 2022.
In October 2022, we reported preliminary Phase 1b clinical data at the 34th EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium, with OP-1250 demonstrating attractive PK with oral bioavailability and high drug exposure, supporting once daily dosing; favorable tolerability with no dose-limiting toxicities and no maximum tolerated dose defined; and strong anti-tumor activity and durable benefit with 41% of patients seeing reductions in target tumor lesions, a 39% clinical benefit rate, or CBR, at our RP2D of 120 mg (seven out of 18 CBR-eligible patients) and six partial responses (four confirmed and two unconfirmed) out of 57 efficacy-evaluable patients. We believe that with this profile, OP-1250 has the potential to become the endocrine therapy of choice for the treatment of ER+/HER2- breast cancer. We anticipate presenting Phase 2 clinical data for OP-1250 as a monotherapy in the second half of 2023.
Based on our clinical results to date, we intend to discuss plans to initiate a pivotal Phase 3 monotherapy trial in second- and third-line advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients at an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, prior to initiating such trial in what we expect to be the second half of 2023. 
In January 2022, we initiated a Phase 1b dose escalation study evaluating OP-1250 in combination with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib for the treatment of recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic ER+/HER2 breast cancer. We presented preliminary results from this Phase 1b study in December 2022 at the 2022 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Across 12 patients, the combination of up to 120 mg of OP-1250 with 125 mg of palbociclib was shown to be well tolerated with no DDI, no induced metabolism of palbociclib, and exposure of OP-1250 in combination with palbociclib was consistent with the observed monotherapy OP-1250 exposure levels. In addition, there was no dose-related increase in the incidence or severity of adverse events, and neutropenia events observed were consistent with the expected profile of palbociclib plus an endocrine therapy. In the third quarter of 2022, we initiated the Phase 2 dose expansion portion of this study with 120 mg of OP-1250 in combination with 125 mg of palbociclib. We anticipate presenting results from this Phase 2 study in the second quarter of 2023.
Concurrently, in the third quarter of 2022, we initiated a Phase 1b dose escalation study of OP-1250 in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitor, ribociclib, and PI3Ka inhibitor, alpelisib, which have both been shown to lead to improvements in both progression-free and overall survival. These studies are ongoing and we anticipate presenting data from the Phase 1b clinical study for OP-1250 in combination with ribociclib in the second half of 2023. In July 2022, we were granted Fast Track designation from the FDA for OP-1250 for the treatment of ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer that has progressed following one or more lines of endocrine therapy with at least one line given in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor.
In July 2020, we entered into a non-exclusive agreement with Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Inc., or Novartis, to evaluate the combination of OP-1250 and Novartis’ KISQALI® (ribociclib), a CDK4/6 inhibitor, as well as PIQRAY® (alpelisib), their PI3Ka inhibitor. Under the terms of the collaboration, Novartis will be responsible for funding a capped majority of the costs for the Phase 1b clinical study, as well as supplying their drugs. In November 2020, we entered into a non-exclusive agreement with Pfizer Inc., or Pfizer, to evaluate the safety and tolerability of OP-1250 in combination with Pfizer’s CDK4/6 inhibitor IBRANCE® (palbociclib) in patients with recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer. Under the terms of the non-exclusive agreement, we will be responsible for conducting the clinical study for the combined therapy and Pfizer is responsible for supplying IBRANCE® (palbociclib) at no cost to us. As part of the collaboration, the parties granted to each other a non-exclusive, royalty- free license under certain of the parties’ respective patent rights in the combination of IBRANCE® and OP-1250 to use the parties’ respective study drugs in research and development, solely to the extent reasonably needed for the other party’s activities in the collaboration. All inventions and data developed in the performance of the clinical trials for the combined therapies (other than those specific to each component study drug), will be jointly owned by the parties.

We expect to present additional monotherapy and combination therapy data in 2023 and initiate a pivotal Phase 3 monotherapy trial of OP-1250 in the second- and third-line settings of ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in the second half of 2023, subject to feedback from the FDA and EMA.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to discover, develop and commercialize next generation targeted therapies for women’s cancers. The key elements of our business strategy to achieve this goal include:

● | Applying our deep understanding of nuclear receptors — particularly the ER — and mechanisms of resistance to develop novel therapeutic approaches for endocrine-driven cancers. Our team has spent over a decade characterizing the structure and function of the ER and its role in driving tumor cell proliferation in HR+ breast cancer. Our knowledge of the ER’s functional domains combined with our medicinal chemistry expertise has allowed us to develop a potent and oral compound that both completely inactivates and strongly promotes degradation of the ER in nonclinical studies. We believe OP-1250’s oral formulation and dual mechanism of action as a CERAN/SERD directly address the limitations of current endocrine therapies, such as fulvestrant and tamoxifen, and has the potential to drive deeper, more durable responses.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Rapidly advancing our lead product candidate, OP-1250, through clinical development as a monotherapy for ER+/HER2 breast cancer. We are currently evaluating OP-1250 monotherapy in a Phase 1/2 dose escalation and expansion clinical study in patients with recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic ER+/HER2 breast cancer whose disease has progressed on endocrine therapy. We plan to initiate a pivotal Phase 3 trial for OP-1250 as a monotherapy agent in the second- and third-line setting of ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in the second half of 2023, subject to feedback from the FDA and EMA.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Establishing OP-1250 as the endocrine therapy of choice with targeted therapy combinations for the treatment of metastatic ER+ breast cancers. We believe OP-1250’s differentiated product profile has the potential to overcome many of the limitations of current endocrine therapy options. While targeted chemotherapy and other targeted anti-body drug conjugates continue to show promising data and will likely gain further favorability as a treatment option, we believe these new treatment options will replace traditional chemotherapy, not endocrine therapies. Our goal is to successfully demonstrate improved efficacy and a favorable tolerability profile in combination with other targeted therapies in order to position OP-1250 as the endocrine therapy of choice in the first-line setting for advanced or metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exploring additional clinical opportunities for OP-1250, including metastatic breast cancer with brain metastases and other hormone sensitive tumors. Metastatic breast cancer is the second most common cancer associated with brain metastases in the United States. Of women with ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer, 10% to 15% will develop brain metastases, which present a significant challenge to systemic therapy. The primary treatment for CNS metastases is typically surgery, radiation, or a combination of both and these patients tend to have a poor prognosis. In nonclinical studies, OP-1250 demonstrated robust CNS penetration, and in an intracranial breast cancer brain metastases xenograft study, OP-1250 demonstrated the ability to shrink tumors and improve survival in mice. In addition, we believe that combining OP-1250 with HER2 targeted agents may represent an opportunity to improve upon recent advancements in the treatment of CNS disease in patients that express both ER and HER2, as up to 50% of patients with metastatic HER2+ breast cancer develop CNS disease, and the majority of patients with HER2+ breast cancer also express ER. In nonclinical studies, the addition of OP-1250 to HER2 inhibitors improved tumor growth inhibition in both ER+/HER2+ cell line-derived xenograft and patient-derived xenograft models.

development and commercialization rights to OP-1250. We have established clinical collaborations with both Novartis and Pfizer and we intend to continue evaluating opportunities to work with partners that meaningfully enhance our capabilities with respect to the development and commercialization of OP-1250. In addition, we intend to commercialize our product candidates in key markets either alone or with partners in order to maximize the worldwide commercial potential of our programs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expanding our portfolio of therapies focused on women’s oncology through both internal research activities and business development efforts. We are applying our internal drug discovery capabilities to identify and evaluate novel targeted therapies that can improve the lives of women with cancer. We have an active discovery research team exploring additional opportunities for targeted therapies for breast cancer. We will also continue to explore opportunities to acquire products and technologies that align with our core areas of expertise and complement our existing portfolio.

Our Opportunity
Epidemiology and classification of breast cancer
Breast cancer is the second-most common cancer worldwide, with nearly two million new diagnoses per year. In 2022, the ACS estimated there were approximately 288,000 new cases of female breast cancer and over 43,250 deaths in the United States, making it the second-leading cause of cancer death in women. Approximately 2,700 men are also diagnosed with breast cancer each year in the United States. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease which is grouped into several clinical subtypes based on the expression of three proteins: ER, PR and HER2. Both ER and PR are hormone receptors, and tumors that express either of these receptors are referred to as HR+. It is unusual for a tumor to express PR in the absence of the ER, therefore most tumors are referred to as either ER+ or ER-. Tumors that express HER2 are denoted HER2+, and tumors that do not express ER, PR or HER2 are classified as triple negative breast cancer. Approximately 78% of all breast cancers are HR+, and approximately 68% are HR+/HER2-, highlighting the central role of ER signaling in driving a large majority of breast cancer. The percentage breakdown of all breast cancers by subtype are shown in Figure 2.

Treating breast cancer
Early-stage breast cancer
Breast cancer stage is determined by the size of the tumor and whether or not the cancer has spread to lymph nodes. A tumor that is confined to the breast with or without the involvement of local, ipsilateral lymph nodes is considered early-stage breast cancer. Treatment for patients with early-stage breast cancer involves two components. First, there is local treatment of the breast, chest wall and local lymph nodes, if any, with surgery, either a lumpectomy or mastectomy, and potentially radiation. Second, based on the biology and characteristics of the tumor, patients may also be offered systemic therapy, referred to as adjuvant therapy, in order to decrease the risk of recurrence of breast cancer anywhere in the body. Systemic therapy can be given either after surgery (adjuvant) or prior to surgery (neoadjuvant) or a combination of both.
The initial standard of care for patients with early-stage ER+ breast cancer is at least five years of adjuvant endocrine therapy. The endocrine treatment options for early-stage disease are AIs, such as anastrozole, exemestane or letrozole, or an ER antagonist such as a tamoxifen. For patients diagnosed with early-stage ER+ breast cancer who undergo surgical and adjuvant/neoadjuvant treatment, the five-year survival rate is over 90%.
Metastatic breast cancer
When cancer has spread beyond local lymph nodes, either to distant lymph nodes, bones or visceral organs, the cancer is now considered metastatic. Approximately 6-10% of breast cancer patients present with de novo metastatic disease, also referred to as stage IV disease, at initial diagnosis. In addition, approximately 20-30% of patients diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer will develop metastatic disease. In contrast to the goals of 

13



adjuvant therapy, treatments for metastatic disease are palliative with the desired outcome of controlling symptoms and extending survival as long as possible. The current five-year survival rate for patients with ER+ metastatic breast cancer is approximately 30%.
While there are national guidelines and recommendations for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, the actual treatment decision is based on a combination of individual patient characteristics and tumor biology, including whether they received adjuvant therapy and if so, how quickly the cancer recurred. There is significant overlap in the agents that are recommended, but guidelines vary in the sequence in which these agents are used. In the past five years, several new classes of targeted therapies have been approved to be used in combination with endocrine agents for the treatment of HR+/HER2- breast cancer. Inhibitors of CDK4/6, such as palbociclib, ribociclib and abemaciclib, used in combination with an AI or fulvestrant, led to significant increases in progression-free survival and overall survival. Alpelisib, a PI3Ka inhibitor, was approved in 2019 in combination with fulvestrant for the treatment of HR+/HER2- breast cancers that have mutations in PIK3CA. Figure 3 shows the endocrine treatment options available for ER+ metastatic breast cancer, and an example of the sequence of treatments, by agent and line of therapy.
Figure 3. Available endocrine options and example of sequential alternating of endocrinebased therapy in ER+ metastatic breast cancer
​
When moving a patient from one line of therapy to the next, the standard of care is to switch to an endocrine agent with a different mechanism of action depending upon last therapy, co-morbidities, and individual patient characteristics.
Metastatic breast cancer is the second most common cancer associated with brain metastases in the United States. About 10% to 15% of women with metastatic breast cancer develop brain metastases. Brain metastases present a significant challenge to systemic therapy, and the primary treatment for CNS metastases is typically surgical resection, radiation, or a combination of both. Given the limited treatment options available for these patients, the prognosis remains poor, making it an area of continued, high unmet medical need. In addition, brain metastases in breast cancer patients are a major cause of morbidity, associated with progressive neurologic deficits that result in a reduced quality of life.

14



ER signaling in cancer
The ER is a nuclear receptor that functions as a ligand regulated transcription factor. When bound to estrogen, the ER directs the expression of genes that are essential for breast cancer cells’ survival and proliferation. The ER has three modular functional domains:

● | The amino terminal domain, which contains the activation function 1, or AF1, the activity of which can be increased by multiple cell proliferative signaling pathways;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The DNA binding domain, which directs the ER to bind to a specific set of ER-responsive genes; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The ligand binding domain, which contains the activation function 2, or AF2, which is turned on when bound to estrogen.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Activation of either AF1 or AF2 can drive transcription and cancer cell proliferation.
Figure 4. ER is a tripartite protein with two distinct transcription factor activation domains,AF1 and AF2
​
​
​
Classes of endocrine therapies and their limitations
For more than four decades, researchers have been developing new approaches and therapies to prevent activation of the ER pathway, thereby inhibiting the ability of the ER to drive tumor cell growth. Figure 5 describes the two major classes of endocrine therapies, AIs and ER antagonists. In 2020, worldwide sales for endocrine and targeted therapies treating ER+ breast cancer patients totaled $20.5 billion.

15



Figure 5. Classes of endocrine therapies
Antagonists with partial agonist activity
In 1977, the first endocrine therapeutic, tamoxifen, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of breast cancer. Although tamoxifen directly competes with estrogen and prevents activation of the AF2 transcription factor activation domain, it does not block AF1 activity and therefore does not completely inhibit ER function (Figure 6). As a consequence of this partial agonist activity, tamoxifen mimics estrogen in some circumstances and promotes proliferation. In addition, some breast cancers can develop resistance to these partial agonists by activation of upstream AF1 signaling pathways, such as mTOR, PI3K, MAPK, c-SRC, EGFR, FGFR and IGFR. Therefore, while tamoxifen is commonly used today, it is challenged by acquired drug resistance and a relatively short duration of response.
Figure 6. Partial agonists, such as tamoxifen, are unable to completely block ER activation
In search of a different mechanism to target the estrogen pathway, AIs were developed in the 1990s to block the synthesis of estrogen and deprive the ER+ tumor of its activating ligand. However, most patients with metastatic breast cancer have been shown to ultimately develop resistance to these therapies. Similar to tamoxifen, resistance to AIs, such as anastrozole, exemestane or letrozole, can develop by multiple mechanisms, including activation of the AF1 pathway and development of mutations. Mutations in ESR1 that confer estrogen-independent ER activity arise in up to 50% of patients receiving treatment with an AI in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in the first-line metastatic setting.
SERDs
In the search for more potent ER antagonists, researchers focused on another class of ER drugs that were described as SERDs. This classification arose from the observation that certain ligands bind tightly to ER 

16



leading to ER degradation. The field shifted drug discovery efforts to SERDs based on the hypothesis that degrading ER would be more efficacious than inhibiting it. However, similar to tamoxifen, many compounds with SERD activity are not complete ER antagonists nor do they achieve complete degradation of the ER. Recent experiments conducted by us and third parties in nonclinical models of breast cancer suggest that ER degradation, as achieved by many SERDs, on its own is not sufficient to effectively treat tumors and that the ability to completely inhibit ER function is best achieved through complete antagonism.
CERANs
A CERAN is a molecule that completely blocks the ability of both AF1 and AF2 to stimulate gene transcription (Figure 7). CERANs inhibit activation of the AF2 transcription factor activation domain and inactivate AF1 activity by recruiting nuclear receptor corepressors of the N-CoR/SMRT family. Previous work by one of our co-founders identified specific interactions between fulvestrant-bound ER and N-CoR and that the strength of these interactions correlated with the ability of fulvestrant-bound ER to inactivate gene transcription through the transcription factor activating domain, AF1.
Figure 7. Complete antagonists turn off AF2 and recruit N-CoR to inactivate AF1
​
In 2002, fulvestrant was approved as a treatment for HR+ metastatic breast cancer and is typically used as a second- or third-line endocrine agent. Fulvestrant represented a breakthrough for the field based on its dual- mechanism of action as a CERAN and SERD which led to improved efficacy outcomes for patients. However, fulvestrant, the only FDA-approved anti-estrogen lacking agonist-type effects in in vivo uterotropic assays in immature or ovariectomized mice and rats, has several limitations including:

● | Painful and inconvenient route of administration. Fulvestrant is a highly insoluble compound with poor oral bioavailability and therefore must be given intramuscularly. Fulvestrant is administered every 28 days in two 5 ml intramuscular injections into the buttocks. Injection site reactions occur in approximately 10% of patients and include sciatica, neuralgia, neuropathic pain, and peripheral neuropathy.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Suboptimal drug exposure limits efficacy. In a nonclinical mouse model, an increase in antitumor activity and ER degradation was observed as the dose of fulvestrant was increased from 25 mg/kg to 200 mg/kg. However, researchers estimated that achieving an equivalent level of fulvestrant in humans to a 200 mg/kg dose in mice would require a dose that is eight times higher than is currently clinically achievable. Furthermore, xenograft models created using patient-derived tumors containing ESR1 mutations show that even plasma levels substantially higher than those achievable in humans at the approved dose fail to demonstrate optimal antitumor effect.

We own worldwide development and commercialization rights to OP-1250. Our plan is to develop OP-1250 for the treatment of a number of ER+ breast cancer indications, both as a monotherapy and in combination with approved targeted therapies that have shown improved outcomes with other endocrine therapies.
​
Our solution, OP-1250
OP-1250 is an oral small molecule clinical-stage product candidate for the treatment of endocrine-driven cancers. OP-1250 was designed by our scientific team based both on a detailed structural understanding of the ER and on known alterations to this structure induced by fulvestrant and other ER ligands. We have demonstrated in nonclinical studies that OP-1250 functions both as a CERAN, inactivating both AF1 and AF2 transcriptional activation functions, and a SERD, promoting degradation of the ER. We believe OP-1250’s oral formulation and dual mechanism of action directly address the limitations of current endocrine therapies, such as fulvestrant and tamoxifen, and position OP-1250 as a potential endocrine therapy of choice for the treatment of ER+ breast cancers.
Phase 1/2 monotherapy clinical study
Our Phase 1/2 monotherapy clinical development plan for OP-1250 is outlined in Figure 8 below. We initiated the Phase 1a dose escalation portion of our Phase 1/2 monotherapy clinical study in July 2020 and reported initial results across 41 patients in November 2021. In December 2021, we initiated the Phase 1b dose expansion portion of our monotherapy clinical development plan by expanding enrollment at two doses of 60 mg and 120 mg once daily. We enrolled a total of 68 patients across these two doses through the end of July 2022 and reported interim results in October 2022. In the third quarter of 2022, we selected 120 mg as our recommended Phase 2 dose, or RP2D, and initiated enrollment in the Phase 2 portion of our monotherapy study including targeting a total enrollment of 50 patients with measurable disease, 15 patients with non-measurable disease, and 15 patients with CNS metastasis. Our first two primary cohorts of 50 patients with measurable disease and 15 patients with non-measurable disease were fully enrolled in the fourth quarter of 2022.

Phase 1a dose-escalation results
We reported the first clinical data from the Phase 1a dose-escalation portion of the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical study of OP-1250 in November 2021, with a data cut-off of November 1, 2021. These initial data provide proof-

of-concept for OP-1250 as a once-daily oral monotherapy in women with recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer.
PK, safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of once-daily OP-1250 monotherapy were evaluated in the open-label, dose-escalation portion of the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical study (NCT04505826). As of November 1, 2021, a total of 41 patients with recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer were enrolled across seven dose cohorts (30 mg, 60 mg, 90 mg, 120 mg, 150 mg, 210 mg, and 300 mg once-daily). This was a heavily pretreated population with 95% of patients previously treated with a CDK4/6 inhibitor (nine patients, or 22%, received two or more prior CDK4/6 inhibitor regimens), 68% of patients received prior fulvestrant, and 42% received prior chemotherapy in the advanced setting. Overall, patients received a median of three prior lines of anti-cancer therapy and two prior lines of endocrine therapy in advanced settings. Of 39 patients whose circulating tumor DNA, or ctDNA, was assessed, ESR1 mutations were detected in 49% at baseline.
PK analyses demonstrated dose-proportional increases in OP-1250 exposures across all evaluated doses, high oral bioavailability and steady-state plasma levels with minimal peak-to-trough variability. OP-1250 was generally well tolerated, and no dose-limiting toxicities were reported at any of the seven dose levels studied. A maximum tolerated dose was not reached. The majority of reported adverse events were grade 1 or 2 at all dose levels, and the most common treatment-related adverse events, or TRAEs, as assessed by study investigator were nausea (49%), fatigue (34%), vomiting (22%) and headache (17%). No clinically significant bradycardia, ocular toxicities or diarrhea occurred. As of the data cut-off of November 1, 2021, three patients had grade 4 neutropenia attributed to study drug by the investigator. Two of these patients presented with fever and neutropenia. A RP2D range of 60 mg to 120 mg was identified for further evaluation based on PK, favorable tolerability, and initial evidence of anti-tumor activity.
Early evidence of anti-tumor activity was observed in patients across all dose levels tested in the Phase 1a dose escalation portion of the study. Patients were scheduled for tumor assessments at eight-week intervals. Patients were considered efficacy-evaluable for overall response rate, or ORR, if they had response evaluation criteria in solid tumors, or RECIST,-measurable disease at baseline and at least one post-baseline tumor assessment or discontinued treatment prior to their first post-baseline assessment, and for CBR if they were enrolled at least 24 weeks prior to the data cut-off date.
As of the data cut-off date of November 1, 2021, three partial responses were observed among 24 efficacy-evaluable patients, including two confirmed partial responses and one unconfirmed partial response. The patient with the unconfirmed partial response demonstrated robust target lesion reduction of 100% but remained unconfirmed due to progressive disease with a new lesion appearing at a follow-up visit. All three responses occurred in patients with ESR1 mutations and who had previously received CDK4/6 and aromatase inhibitors, and fulvestrant. As of the data cut-off date, 32% of patients (13/41) remained on treatment with efficacy data continuing to mature, including both patients with confirmed partial responses.

Phase 1b/2 monotherapy dose expansion clinical study
We reported interim clinical results from the Phase 1b monotherapy dose expansion portion of the Phase 1/2 study of OP-1250 in October 2022 at a poster session of the 34th EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics in Barcelona, Spain, with a data cut-off of September 2, 2022. The results continued to demonstrate that at doses of 60 mg and 120mg once daily, OP-1250 is well-tolerated, achieves high drug exposure, and has encouraging anti-tumor activity across both wild-type and ESR1 mutant tumors.
PK, safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of once-daily OP-1250 monotherapy were evaluated in the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical study (NCT04505826). As of September 2, 2022, 68 patients with recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer were treated across two doses of 60 mg and 120 mg orally once per day. This group was heavily pretreated with 69% having received 2 or more prior lines of therapy and 32% having received prior chemotherapy in the advanced setting. Almost all patients (96%) received prior treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor, and 65% received prior treatment with fulvestrant. Of 46 patients whose ctDNA was assessed, 59% had activating mutations in ESR1 at baseline.
We anticipate presenting Phase 2 clinical data for OP-1250 as a monotherapy in the second half of 2023.
Figure 9. Baseline patient characteristics for OP-1250 monotherapy Phase 1b expansion study
​
Pharmacokinetics
OP-1250 demonstrated favorable PK characterized by high oral bioavailability and dose proportional exposure. With an approximately 8-day half-life, OP-1250 exhibited the desired low peak-to-trough variability in a 24-hour period at steady state, supporting once daily dosing with complete inhibition of the ER for the full dosing interval. 

20



A RP2D of 120 mg once per day orally was selected based on overall PK, tolerability and efficacy. Dosing at the RP2D yielded drug exposure that exceeded targeted efficacy thresholds based on pre-clinical models.
Figure 10. OP-1250 steady-state plasma concentration-time profiles
​
Tolerability
Treatment with OP-1250 was well tolerated at both the 60 mg and 120 mg dose levels with no dose-limiting toxicities. The most common TRAEs that occurred in at least 15% of subjects as assessed by the treating physician were nausea (42%), fatigue (25%) and vomiting (15%). Of the 68 patients treated, one patient experienced Grade 3 neutropenia concurrent with progressive disease, and three patients experienced Grade 4 neutropenia at the 120 mg dose. Of these cases, one patient had dosing interrupted for one week, restarted therapy at 60 mg and subsequently had a confirmed response with no further incidence of neutropenia. The two other patients discontinued treatment with recovery of their neutrophil counts. These events have occurred at a low rate and are manageable and reversible.

Efficacy
Six partial responses across the two doses had been observed as of the data cut-off date of September 2, 2022 among 57 efficacy-evaluable patients (per RECIST measurable lesions and at least one on-treatment tumor assessment), including four confirmed partial responses and two unconfirmed partial responses awaiting confirmation at a follow-up scan. Strong anti-tumor activity was observed with 41% of patients demonstrating reduction in target lesions and evidence of activity in both wild-type and mutant estrogen receptors across both doses. As of the data cut-off date, 31% of patients (21/68) remained on treatment with efficacy data continuing to mature.

Phase 1b/2 combination dose escalation and expansion clinical studies
Our clinical development strategy for OP-1250 includes exploring the potential for combination treatment of advanced or metastatic breast cancer with other targeted therapies. We are initially focused on exploring the potential for OP-1250 in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors palbociclib and ribociclib and PI3Ka inhibitor, alpelisib. In December 2021, we initiated the Phase 1b dose escalation portion of our Phase 1b/2 combination clinical study in combination with palbociclib and reported preliminary results in December 2022. We are currently enrolling patients in the Phase 2 dose expansion portion of this study. We anticipate presenting results from this Phase 2 clinical study in the second quarter of 2023. In the third quarter of 2022, we initiated the Phase 1b dose escalation portion of our Phase 1b/2 combination clinical study in combination with both ribociclib and alpelisib. We anticipate presenting data from the Phase 1b clinical study for OP-1250 in combination with ribociclib in the second half of 2023.

23



Phase 1b/2 combination dose escalation and expansion clinical study with palbociclib
In December 2021, we initiated a Phase 1b/2 clinical study of OP-1250 in combination with palbociclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor. We reported preliminary clinical data from the Phase 1b dose escalation portion of the clinical study in December 2022 at the 2022 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in San Antonio, Texas. The preliminary results demonstrated attractive combinability with no dose-limiting toxicities, no dose-related increase in the incidence or severity of adverse events and no DDI with exposure levels of each drug consistent with monotherapy or standard of care combinations. 
As of the data cut-off of September 12, 2022, 12 patients with recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer were treated across four dose escalation cohorts: three patients per cohort dosed at 30, 60, 90, and 120 mg in combination with palbociclib 125 mg. Ten of the 12 patients received prior therapy for advanced disease, including eight patients who had received prior CDK4/6 inhibitors and nine patients who received prior endocrine therapy for advanced disease. Of 11 patients whose ctDNA was assessed, 36% had activating mutations in ESR1 at baseline.
Figure 14. Baseline patient characteristics from Phase 1b study in combination with palbociclib
​
Pharmacokinetics
OP-1250 demonstrated favorable PK characterized by high oral bioavailability, dose proportional exposure and a long half-life of eight days, with steady-state plasma levels showing minimal peak-to-trough variability, enabling consistent inhibition of ER for the full dosing interval. There was no observed DDI between palbociclib and OP-1250 in the dose range of 30 mg to 120 mg. Palbociclib did not affect OP-1250 drug exposures compared to monotherapy dosing, and OP-1250 had no effect on palbociclib 125 mg drug exposures when compared to published concentrations.

Tolerability
Treatment with OP-1250 up to the RP2D of 120 mg was well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities, and maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, was not reached. The majority of treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, were Grade 1 or 2 and increasing the dose did not show an increase in frequency of events. OP-1250 was not dose-reduced in any patients, and no patients discontinued treatment with OP-1250 due to an adverse event, including neutropenia. Neutropenia events observed were consistent with the expected profile of palbociclib plus an endocrine therapy. There was no Grade 4 neutropenia, and eight of 12 patients reported Grade 3 neutropenia, a rate which is consistent with the FDA-approved label of palbociclib plus an endocrine agent.

Clinical development plan for OP-1250 and additional clinical opportunities
In the third quarter of 2022, we selected 120 mg once daily as the RP2D. We completed enrollment in the two primary cohorts of our Phase 2 monotherapy expansion study in the fourth quarter of 2022 (50 patients with measurable disease and 15 patients with non-measurable disease) at the RP2D. Based on our clinical results to date, we are actively planning to initiate a monotherapy pivotal Phase 3 trial in the second half of 2023 in the second- and third-line setting for locally advanced or metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer, subject to feedback from the FDA and EMA. 
We are currently exploring the potential for OP-1250 to combine with CDK4/6 inhibitors palbociclib and ribociclib in Phase 1b/2 dose escalation and expansion studies. Subject to positive results from these ongoing studies, we anticipate initiating a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor in 2024 for the treatment of advanced or metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer in the first-line setting.
While all populations described above are in patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancer, we believe that there is an opportunity for us to study OP-1250 in patients with ER+/HER2+ breast cancer, which represents approximately 11% of breast cancer patients and more than 50% of the patients with HER2+ breast cancer. In particular, up to 50% of patients with metastatic HER2+ breast cancer develop CNS disease. We believe that combining OP-1250 with HER2 targeted agents may represent an opportunity to improve upon recent advancements in the treatment of CNS disease in patients that express both ER and HER2. 
We are conducting a series of pharmacology studies for OP-1250, including DDI fed/fast and bioequivalence to a tablet formulation, and expect to complete these studies in 2023. We believe that the conversion from 

27



capsule to tablet formulation of OP-1250 may have certain clinical advantages and we expect to transition to tablet administration prior to initiation of a pivotal trial in what we expect to be the second half of 2023.
While our initial studies are focused on treating breast cancer patients with metastatic disease, we believe that if OP-1250 is determined to be safe and effective in this population, there is potential for it to be used in earlier stage disease. Based on our extensive nonclinical studies, including certain head-to-head studies, we believe that OP-1250 could have superior PK properties and improved clinical outcomes than fulvestrant. If proven in the clinic, we believe that OP-1250 has the potential to not only replace fulvestrant but to become the endocrine treatment of choice for the treatment of both advanced/metastatic ER+ breast cancer as well as ultimately in early-stage ER+ breast cancer in the adjuvant setting.
In addition to breast cancer, we intend to explore the use of OP-1250 in various gynecological malignancies, beginning with endometrial cancer. Approximately 80% of endometrial tumors are “endometriod” in nature and these tumors are driven by estrogen.
Nonclinical data
Complete ER antagonism
A key distinguishing feature of CERANs is that they completely lack any agonistic estrogen-like effects, and completely block the effects of estrogen. In a nonclinical model, we evaluated OP-1250 and other compounds with publicly-disclosed chemical structures that have been or are in clinical development for ER+ breast cancer to compare their ability to block breast cancer proliferation and degrade estrogen receptors. Alkaline phosphatase, or AP, is an estrogen-responsive gene in ECC-1 cells driven by AF1 action. The in vitro AP model is a method of determining complete ER antagonism. As shown in Figure 20 below, OP-1250 and other CERANs lack agonistic estrogen like effects and completely block the effects of estrogen.
In the absence of estrogen, OP-1250 and other CERANs completely inactivated AF1 and did not stimulate AF1-dependent AP activity. In the presence of estrogen, OP-1250 and other CERANS demonstrated complete antagonism while non-CERANs were unable to fully inhibit estrogen-stimulated AF-1 activity.
​
Figure 20. CERANs do not activate AF1 in the absence of estrogen, and partial and strong agonists 
do not fully inhibit estrogen-stimulated AF-1 activity
SERD activity
SERDs are ER ligands that lead to partial degradation of the ER. This degradation takes place within four hours after exposure of cells to the SERD, indicating that it comes from destabilization of the ER protein. In a 

28



nonclinical analysis, we have tested the ability of OP-1250, fulvestrant, other CERANs and several non-CERAN SERDs to degrade ER across five different cell lines. As shown in Figure 21, after treatment of these cell lines for four hours, OP-1250 and other CERANs strongly degraded the estrogen receptor in all five ER+ cell lines, while non-CERANS demonstrated variable and inconsistent ER degradation. Of note, Estradiol, or E2, the prototypical agonist of ERa, degraded ERa in all five ER+ cell lines. In all cases, none of the compounds achieved full ER degradation, further supporting our belief that complete ER antagonism is independent from degradation and key to inactivating any remaining ER receptor.

Potent anti-proliferative activity
In nonclinical studies, we found that OP-1250 was a potent inhibitor of proliferation in multiple breast cancer cell lines. As shown in Figure 22 below, in a cell proliferation assay using CAMA-1 cells, a human breast cancer line, OP-1250 and other CERANs inhibited estrogen-driven proliferation to a greater degree than non-CERANs.

Potent antagonist activity on both wild-type and mutant ER
Treatment of breast cancers with AI therapy has been shown to lead to the development of resistance mutations in the ESR1 gene. These mutations are acquired during treatment and are found in less than 2% of untreated early- stage breast tumors but in 30-40% of metastatic tumors after treatment with AIs. More than 80% of mutations are found at three locations corresponding to amino acid residues 380, 537 and 538.
These mutations result in resistance to many estrogen therapies. We assessed the ability of estrogen compounds to inhibit ER-dependent transcription in cell lines containing ER alleles with mutations that have been found in patients. We used alkaline phosphatase, which is encoded by a gene activated by the ER primarily through the AF1 transcriptional activation function and has an enzymatic activity that can be readily measured in cells, as a surrogate for ER driven target gene transcription. We tested two clinical stage SERD compounds: ARN-810, also known as GDC-0810, a discontinued compound previously in Phase 2 clinical development by Genentech; and AZD9496, an AstraZeneca compound that has presented Phase 1 data. Both 

30



compounds were unable to fully inhibit the activity of the mutant ER. At the highest concentrations tested of approximately 1 μM, these compounds were unable to fully inhibit the alkaline phosphatase activity stimulated by the D538G mutation and had no activity in cells containing the Y537S mutation. In contrast, both OP-1250 and fulvestrant were able to fully inhibit the alkaline phosphatase activity in cells containing these mutations. These observations suggest that tumors that become resistant to other estrogen therapies may remain sensitive to OP-1250.

AP activity mediated by Y537S and D538G mutant ERa in an endometrial cell line. AP activity was assayed by treating transiently transfected Ishikawa cells with ligands in E2-depleted media for 3 days. Absorbance was read after incubation with a chromogenic substrate for AP. Shown are mean values normalized to vehicle, along with SEM from triplicate wells. The line labeled “endogenous” represents the mean AP activity of cells transfected with an empty vector, indicating the AP activity of the endogenous receptor. ARN-810, also known as GDC-0810, has been discontinued by Genentech.
Potent tumor shrinkage in nonclinical models
OP-1250 shrank or eliminated tumors in a wide variety of xenograft models including in an ovariectomized mouse breast cancer model designed to mimic the endocrine environment of post-menopausal women using HCI- 013EI, an estrogen-independent patient-derived xenograft model containing a Y537S mutation. In this model, tumor growth occurred even in the absence of estrogen production due to the constitutive or always-on activity of the Y537S mutant ER protein. At daily oral doses of 3 mg/kg and higher, dosing with OP-1250 led to tumor reductions in all treated mice. In contrast, fulvestrant led to a detectable reduction in only two of the seven treated mice.

Bottom panel of Figure 24 shows tumor size of each tumor measured with calipers at termination. Top panel shows mean tumor size of each treatment group of eight over the course of the study. HCC1500, wild type ER cell line implanted in NSG mice; ST941 patient derived xenograft, or PDX, model with Y537S ER in JAX nude mice; HCI013 PDX model with Y537S ER in NOD/SCID mice.
Daily oral dosing with OP-1250 led to tumor shrinkage in multiple xenograft models in mice with intact ovaries. These models included the HCC1500 cell line, which have wild-type ER and the ST941 and HCI-013 patient- derived xenograft models, both of which contain ERs that have the Y537S mutation. Similar to what was seen in the ovariectomized mouse model, OP-1250 demonstrated more potent antitumor activity than fulvestrant, which failed to consistently shrink tumors in any of these models.
Brain penetration
There remains an unmet medical need in the treatment of patients with metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer that has spread to the brain. The challenges in treating brain metastasis are multifactorial and likely include the presence of resistance mutations and the inability to achieve efficacious levels of effective drugs in brain tissue. In mice, we found that OP-1250 reached drug levels in the brain as high as 50% greater than in plasma. Combined with the ability to achieve higher drug levels with OP-1250, due to its improved PK properties, than 

32



fulvestrant, we found that we could obtain brain exposure to concentrations of OP-1250 that were greater than 30 times that of fulvestrant.

OP-1250 was dosed daily orally by gavage in the mouse. Plasma levels were measured by HPLC. Cranial tissue samples removed surgically, weighed, macerated, and extracted to determine the concentration of OP-1250.
OP-1250 was effective in an intracranial xenograft brain metastasis model, in which ST941 tumor cells expressing mutant ESR1-Y537S receptors were implanted directly into the brain by stereotactic surgery. Tumors were stimulated with estrogen and allowed to grow for two or three weeks and their presence in the brain confirmed by MRI. The mice were then treated with one of the following: vehicle control; vehicle control with ovariectomy; 5 mg/mouse fulvestrant; 60 mg/kg tamoxifen; 10 mg/kg OP-1250; or 10 mg/kg OP-1250 in combination with 75 mg/kg ribociclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor known to cross the blood brain barrier. Mice were treated once daily for up to 100 days and followed for tumor size with MRI and survival.
As shown in the figures below, OP-1250 shrank tumors in a preclinical intracranial xenograft metastatic tumor model expressing mutant estrogen receptor ESR1-Y537S. All tumors responded to OP-1250 treatment. At 100 days, tumors in mice treated with 10 mg/kg OP-1250 or the combination of 10 mg/kg OP-1250 and 75 mg/kg ribociclib remained small or undetectable while tumors in mice treated with fulvestrant and tamoxifen had started to grow. Further, treatment with OP-1250 alone or in combination with ribociclib prevented death in all animals at day 120 while the vast majority of untreated animals died by day 25. We believe that the ability of OP-1250 to eradicate brain metastasis in mice demonstrates that OP-1250 may have the potential to advance the treatment of patients with breast cancer with brain metastases.

Combinations with other breast cancer therapies
As in most other solid tumors, effective antitumor activity often requires the use of combination therapy. In the case of ER+ breast cancer, for example, activation of the CDK4/6 pathway is associated with resistance to fulvestrant and CDK4/6 inhibitors are routinely used in combination with fulvestrant. We observed that OP-1250 in combination with three different CDK4/6 inhibitors resulted in increased inhibition of MCF-7 cell proliferation as did OP-1250 in combination with the PI3Ka inhibitor alpelisib in T47D cells.

ER+/HER2+ breast cancer
In addition to the favorable efficacy profile of OP-1250 in the Phase 1a dose-escalation portion of the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical study of OP-1250 for the treatment of ER+/HER2- breast cancer, we have shown that OP-1250 can also function in combination with HER2 inhibition in ER+/HER2+ breast cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models. The HER2 oncogene is overexpressed in approximately 25% of breast cancer tumors, about half of which also express ER, and HER2+ tumors have a high rate of brain metastasis. In three ER+/HER2+ cell lines, treatment with OP-1250 reversed the increase in cellular growth induced by treatment with E2 and combined effectively at some dose ranges with the HER2 inhibitor tucatinib.

Proliferation assays of three ER+/HER2+ cell lines treated for 7 days with OP-1250, tucatinib, or the equimolar combination in stripped serum media supplemented with 500 pM estradiol. All cell lines demonstrate reduction in proliferation with OP-1250 treatment and efficacy of combined compound treatment.

OP-1250 also reduced growth of ER+/HER2+ cell lines or patient-derived xenograft models in mouse xenograft studies. Cells were implanted either subcutaneously or in the mammary fat pad and allowed to establish a tumor prior to dosing with OP-1250 and/or HER2 inhibitors tucatinib and trastuzumab. OP-1250 treatment demonstrated reduced tumor growth in combination with both individual HER2 inhibitors and dual HER2 therapy using both tucatinib and trastuzumab.

Left, tumor volume of BT-474 cell line implanted into the mammary fat pad of NSG mice. Right, tumor growth of CTG-3266 PDX model implanted subcutaneously into nude mice. OP-1250 treatment inhibited growth in both models in combination with HER2 inhibitors. Animals were dosed orally with OP-1250 and tucatinib, and by intraperitoneal injection with trastuzumab at the doses listed.
Summary of nonclinical properties
We believe OP-1250’s oral formulation and dual mechanism of action directly address the limitations of current endocrine therapies, such as fulvestrant and tamoxifen, and position OP-1250 as a potential endocrine therapy of choice for the treatment of ER+ breast cancers. We have demonstrated in nonclinical studies that OP-1250 functions both as a CERAN and a SERD, but is distinguished from fulvestrant in several noteworthy ways, including:

● | OP-1250 has favorable biodistribution properties leading to higher drug concentrations in the plasma and tumor than those achieved with fulvestrant, as shown in a head-to-head mouse xenograft study; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | OP-1250 has demonstrated the ability to shrink tumors in head-to-head nonclinical studies with fulvestrant, in contrast to fulvestrant, which has only been shown to inhibit tumor growth.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe OP-1250 has the potential to improve clinical outcomes for patients with metastatic breast cancer, initially for patients who have previously received endocrine therapy, as well as those who are treatment naïve in the metastatic setting. Additionally, given the differentiated product profile, we believe that OP-1250 has the potential to advance into the adjuvant setting for early-stage ER+ breast cancer.
Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement with Novartis
In July 2020, we entered into a non-exclusive Clinical Collaboration and Supply Agreement, or the Novartis Agreement, with Novartis. The collaboration is focused on the evaluation of the safety, tolerability and efficacy of OP-1250 in combination with Novartis’ proprietary CDK4/6 inhibitor KISQALI® (ribociclib) and/or Novartis’ proprietary phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor PIQRAY® (alpelisib), or collectively the Novartis Study Drugs, as part of our planned Phase 1b clinical study of OP-1250 in patients with metastatic ER+ breast cancer. We 

36



will be responsible for the conduct of the clinical studies for the combined therapies in accordance with a mutually agreed development plan. As part of the collaboration, the parties granted to each other a non-exclusive, royalty- free license under certain of the parties’ respective background patent rights and other technology to use the parties’ respective study drugs in research and development, solely to the extent reasonably needed for the other party’s activities in the collaboration. All inventions and data developed in the performance of the clinical studies for the combined therapies (other than those specific to each component study drug), will be jointly owned by the parties.
We are responsible for manufacturing, packaging and labeling OP-1250, and for packaging and labeling all drugs used in the clinical studies for the combined therapies (other than the Novartis Study Drugs). Novartis is responsible for manufacturing and delivering to us the Novartis Study Drugs in such quantities as reasonably needed for the clinical studies for the combined therapies. In accordance with an agreed budget, Novartis will reimburse us for a majority of the direct outside costs, but no more than an amount in the low single digit millions of U.S. dollars, that we incur related to conducting the activities under the agreed development plan in conducting the clinical trials for the combined therapies.
The Novartis Agreement will terminate upon completion of all activities outlined in the development plan and the relevant protocols. Either party may terminate the Novartis Agreement for the uncured material breach or insolvency of the other party, if it reasonably deems it necessary in order to protect the safety, health or welfare of subjects enrolled in the clinical studies for the combined therapies due to the existence of a material safety issue, or in certain circumstances for an unresolved clinical hold with respect to either the Novartis Study Drugs or OP-1250. In addition, Novartis may terminate the Novartis Agreement if certain disputes between the parties are not resolved after following the applicable dispute resolution procedures, and we may terminate the Novartis Agreement in the event we terminate all clinical studies of the combined therapies other than due to a material safety issue or upon a clinical hold.
The Novartis Agreement does not grant any right of first negotiation to participate in future clinical trials, and each of the parties retains all rights and ability to evaluate their respective compounds in any studies or clinical trials, either as a monotherapy or in combination with any other product or compound, in any therapeutic area. The parties retain their independent rights to commercialize their respective therapies both alone or with other parties.
Clinical Trial Agreement with Pfizer
In November 2020, we entered into a non-exclusive clinical trial agreement with Pfizer, or the Pfizer Agreement, to evaluate the safety and tolerability of OP-1250 in combination with Pfizer’s proprietary CDK4/6 inhibitor IBRANCE® (palbociclib) in patients with recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer in a clinical trial. Under the terms of the non-exclusive agreement, we will be responsible for conducting the clinical study for the combined therapies and Pfizer is responsible for supplying IBRANCE® to us at no cost to us. As part of the collaboration, the parties granted to each other a non-exclusive, royalty- free license under certain of the parties’ respective patent rights in the combination of IBRANCE® and OP-1250 to use the parties’ respective study drugs in research and development, solely to the extent reasonably needed for the other party’s activities in the collaboration. All inventions and data developed in the performance of the clinical trials for the combined therapies (other than those specific to each component study drug), will be jointly owned by the parties.
We are responsible for manufacturing, packaging and labeling OP-1250, and for packaging and labeling all drugs used in the clinical trials for the combined therapies (other than IBRANCE® (palbociclib)). Pfizer is responsible for manufacturing and delivering to us IBRANCE® (palbociclib) in such quantities as reasonably needed for the clinical studies for the combined therapies. 
The Pfizer Agreement will terminate upon completion of all activities outlined in the study plan and the relevant protocols. Either party may terminate the Pfizer Agreement for the uncured material breach or insolvency of the other party, if it reasonably deems it necessary in order to protect the safety, health or welfare of subjects 

37



enrolled in the clinical studies for the combined therapies due to the existence of a material safety issue, or in certain circumstances for an unresolved clinical hold with respect to either the IBRANCE® (palbociclib) or OP-1250. In addition, either party may terminate the Pfizer Agreement if certain disputes between the parties are not resolved after following the applicable dispute resolution procedures or if either party determines to discontinue clinical development for medical, scientific, legal or other reasons.
The Pfizer Agreement does not grant any right of first negotiation to participate in future clinical studies, and each of the parties retains all rights and ability to evaluate their respective compounds.
License Agreement with Aurigene 
In June 2022, we entered into an exclusive global license agreement with Aurigene Discovery Technologies Limited, or Aurigene, to research, develop and commercialize novel small molecule inhibitors of an undisclosed oncology target, or the Aurigene Agreement.
​
Under the terms of the Aurigene Agreement, Aurigene will provide to us an exclusive license to its portfolio of novel small molecule inhibitors of the target. Financial terms of the Aurigene Agreement include a $8.0 million upfront payment from us for rights to a pre-existing Aurigene program and potential future milestone payments of up to $60.0 million in clinical development and regulatory milestones, and up to $370.0 million in commercial milestones. Aurigene is also eligible to receive mid-single-digit to low double-digit royalties on product sales, if any. During the research term, we will contribute funding to Aurigene to facilitate Aurigene’s ongoing discovery efforts. We and Aurigene will jointly direct further preclinical work and, if successful, we will lead clinical development as well as regulatory and commercial activities. We and Aurigene jointly own collaboration compounds and rights to any inventions made during the research term. 
​
The term of the Aurigene Agreement will continue until the expiration of the last-to-expire of all payment obligations with respect to all licensed products thereunder, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the Aurigene Agreement. The Aurigene Agreement may be terminated (a) by us for convenience, in our sole discretion, upon prior written notice to Aurigene, (b) by either us or Aurigene in connection with the other party’s uncured material breach or (c) by either us or Aurigene in connection with the insolvency of the other party.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain, maintain and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights for OP-1250 and any future product candidates and other discoveries, inventions, trade secrets and know-how that are critical to our business operations. Our success also depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property and proprietary rights of others, and in part, on our ability to prevent others from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our intellectual property and proprietary rights. A comprehensive discussion on risks relating to intellectual property is provided under the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Intellectual property rights relevant to pharmaceutical companies typically include a combination of patent rights, regulatory exclusivities, trademark rights, and trade secret protection. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to secure and enforce each of these types of intellectual property rights.
The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of biotechnology has emerged in the United States and in Europe, among other countries. Changes in the patent laws and rules, either by legislation, judicial decisions, or regulatory interpretation in other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights, and more generally could affect the value of our intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, importing or otherwise commercializing any of our patented inventions, either directly or indirectly, will depend 

38



in part on our success in obtaining, defending and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions, and improvements. Regardless of the coverage we seek under our existing patent applications, there is always a risk that an alteration to the product or process may provide sufficient basis for a competitor to avoid infringement claims. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued and courts can reinterpret patent scope after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions, including the United States, permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims.
An issued patent provides its owner (or possibly its licensee) with a right to exclude others from making, using or selling that which is claimed in the patent, for a specified period of time (the “term” of the patent), in the jurisdiction in which the patent is issued. In the United States, and in many other countries, utility patents have a presumptive term of 20 years from their effective filing date (which is the earliest non-provisional filing date to which the patent claims priority). However, many jurisdictions, including the United States, require the payment of periodic annuities or maintenance fees for patents to remain in force for the full 20-year term. The United States also has provisions that require a patent term to be shortened if its claims are too similar to another patent owned by the same party that has a shorter term. The term of a patent, and the protection it affords, is therefore limited and once the patent term of our issued patents has expired, we may face competition. Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of the drugs we develop, it is possible that, before OP-1250 or any future product candidates we may develop can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent.
The United States and certain other jurisdictions also have provisions that permit extension of patent term for patents that claim a drug or drug product, or its approved use, if the patent was issued before clinical trials and were completed and regulatory approval secured, so long as certain specific requirements were satisfied. In the United States, such extension associated with regulatory approval is called a Patent Term Extension, or PTE, and it is limited to a maximum of five years, or less if the extended patent term would exceed 14 years after the date of regulatory approval. Only one patent can receive regulatory extension (e.g., PTE) per product approval.
The United States also offers a different form of patent term extension, known as Patent Term Adjustment, or PTA, whereby a particular patent’s term is automatically extended beyond the 20-year date if the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, caused delay during its examination; however, potentially available PTA is reduced by any amount of any delay caused by the patent applicant. We may not receive an extension if we fail to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. There can be no assurance that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents.
A provisional patent application can establish a priority date for a patent, but only if certain deadlines and procedures are met. Specifically, a non-provisional application must be filed within 12 months of the provisional filing date, and such non-provisional filing must be made by an applicant who has properly documented its right to claim priority. Furthermore, if any changes are made to the application between the provisional and the non- provisional filings, the changed material may not be entitled to the priority filing date. Still further, in the biopharmaceutical industry, it is common for applicants to file a so-called “international” patent application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, as a non-provisional filing. Such an international application, often referred to as a “PCT application,” like a provisional application, cannot itself issue as a patent but rather preserves the applicant’s right to pursue patent filings in individual countries, which patent filings are referred to as “national applications” or “national phase filings” and can claim the benefit of priority to the prior PCT application (which may in turn claim priority to the prior provisional filing). For most jurisdictions, national phase applications claiming priority to a PCT application must be filed within 30 to 32 months of the PCT’s earliest priority date. If we fail to meet the deadline for filing non-provisional or national phase applications, or fail to complete all procedural requirements associated with such filings, we may lose our right to claim priority. 

39



Moreover, even if we comply with all deadlines and requirements, we may not be able to issue patents in relevant jurisdictions, and furthermore cannot predict whether any patents that might issue will provide us with any competitive advantage.
We have granted patents and pending applications relating to OP-1250, including granted claims that encompass the OP-1250 compound, pharmaceutical compositions that include OP-1250, and certain methods of using OP-1250, including in treatment which may involve combination therapy. The 20-year term for these patents expires in 2036. In the United States, it is uncertain whether any PTE will be available, and if so, how much. Additional applications are pending, including ones that relate to dosing regimens and treatment of particular cancers and patient populations, and, if granted, will have 20-year terms that expire between 2040 and 2043. 
Certain patents related to OP-1250 may be eligible for PTE in certain jurisdictions, including the United States and Europe, upon approval of a commercial use of the corresponding product by a regulatory agency in the jurisdiction where the patent was granted. However, there can be no assurance that we will receive or benefit from any PTE with respect to such patents.
In addition to patent term extension regulatory exclusivities, pharmaceutical marketing approval agencies, such as the FDA and the EMA, offer certain data exclusivities for first-approved products with a new chemical entity, or NCE, exclusivity, and/or for approvals related to orphan indications, or Orphan Drug designation, and/or pediatric approvals, or Pediatric Exclusivity.
Furthermore, as OP-1250 has not previously been approved in the United States for any indication, OP-1250 may be eligible for five years of NCE exclusivity upon its first approval. Should that approval be for an orphan indication for which we have received Orphan Drug designation, the NCE and Orphan Drug exclusivity would run concurrently.
With respect to our owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any current patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting OP-1250 or any future product candidates and the methods used to manufacture them. Moreover, any issued patents and those that may issue in the future may not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of OP-1250 or any future product candidates. Any patents and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, narrowed, circumvented or invalidated, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related product candidates or limit the length of the term of patent protection that we may have for OP-1250 or any future product candidates. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with complete protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products to ours. For information regarding risks related to intellectual property, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”

40



We have also applied to register the “Olema,” “Olema Oncology,” “Olema Oncology and design,” and “Olema Therapeutics” trademarks with the USPTO. We do not currently own any U.S. registered trademarks for our brand or trade names. Our trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented, or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we need to build name recognition among potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. At times, competitors may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively, and our business may be adversely affected. Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights related to trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights or other intellectual property may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.
In addition to patent, regulatory exclusivity, and trademark, we rely on trade secret and know-how protection to secure our proprietary position around our chemistry, technology and other discoveries and inventions that we consider important to our business.
We also seek to protect our intellectual property, including our trade secrets and know-how, in part by entering into confidentiality agreements with companies with whom we share proprietary and confidential information in the course of business discussions, and by having confidentiality terms in our agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, clinical investigators and other contractors and also by requiring our employees, commercial contractors, and certain consultants and investigators, to enter into invention assignment agreements that grant us ownership of any discoveries or inventions made by them while in our employ. However, trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets or proprietary technology and processes or that these agreements will afford us adequate protection of our intellectual property and proprietary rights. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. For information regarding risks related to intellectual property, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Sales and Marketing
Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. We intend to build a commercial infrastructure to support sales of any approved products. We intend to continue evaluating opportunities to work with partners that enhance our capabilities with respect to the development and commercialization of OP-1250. In addition, we intend to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, in key markets either alone or with partners in order to maximize the worldwide commercial potential of our programs.
Manufacturing
We currently do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely for the foreseeable future, on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to produce OP-1250 for nonclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if OP-1250 receives marketing approval. We require that our CMOs produce bulk drug substances and finished drug products in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, and all other applicable laws and regulations. We maintain agreements with our manufacturers that include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to OP-1250.

41



We have engaged CMOs to manufacture and package OP-1250 for nonclinical and clinical use. Additional CMOs are used to label and distribute OP-1250 for clinical use. We obtain our supplies from these CMOs on a purchase order basis and do not have long-term supply arrangements in place. Although we do not currently have contractual arrangements in place for redundant supply for OP-1250, it is our goal to identify and contract with at least two manufacturers for active pharmaceutical ingredient and two manufacturers for drug product. More broadly, for OP-1250 and any other product candidates we may develop, we intend to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient and fill-and-finish services prior to seeking regulatory approval.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid technological advancement, significant competition and an emphasis on intellectual property. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with current therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, nonclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and oncology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or less expensive than any products we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. We believe that the key competitive factors affecting the success of any of our product candidates, if approved, will include efficacy, combinability, safety profile, convenience, cost, level of promotional activity devoted to them and intellectual property protection.
If the product candidates for our priority programs are approved for the indications we are currently targeting, they will compete with the products discussed below. Furthermore, it is possible that other companies are also engaged in discovery or nonclinical development of product candidates for the same indications. These competitors, if successful in clinical development, may achieve regulatory approval and market adoption in advance of our product candidates, constraining our ability to gain significant market share for such product candidates. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, will complete with multiple approved products or products that may be approved for future indications for which we develop such product candidate.

42



There are several currently marketed drugs and product candidates currently in development for the treatment of ER+ breast cancer that target the estrogen receptor that may compete with OP-1250: including fulvestrant, marketed as Faslodex® by AstraZeneca PLC and or any generic equivalents of Faslodex® that are marketed or in development; elacestrant, marketed as ORSERDUTM by Stemline Therapeutics Inc.; giredestrant (GDC-9545), being developed by Roche Holding AG/Genentech, Inc.; camizestrant (AZD9833), being developed by AstraZeneca PLC; imlunestrant (LY3484356), being developed by Eli Lilly and Co.; ARV-471, being developed by Arvinas, Inc.; and lasofoxifene, being developed by Sermonix Pharmaceuticals.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
As a biopharmaceutical company that operates in the United States, we are subject to extensive regulation. Government authorities in the United States (at the federal, state and local level) and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products such as those we are developing. Any drug candidates that we develop must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in Europe are addressed in a centralized way, but country-specific regulation remains essential in many respects.
U.S. Drug development process
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests, nonclinical animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulations and other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s current good clinical practice, or GCP, regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its proposed indication;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA, for a new drug;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

43




● | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the drug candidate enters the nonclinical testing stage. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies, to assess the characteristics and potential safety and activity of the drug candidate. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human trials. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance.
For each successive clinical trial conducted with the investigational drug, a separate, new protocol submission to an existing IND must be made, along with any subsequent changes to the investigational plan. Sponsors are also subject to ongoing reporting requirements, including submission of IND safety reports for any serious adverse experiences associated with use of the investigational drug or findings from nonclinical studies suggesting a significant risk for human subjects, as well as IND annual reports on the progress of the investigations conducted under the IND.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.

44



Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

● | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion, the side effects associated with increasing doses and if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2. The drug is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases or conditions and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.

● | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall benefit/risk ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 trials. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects.
Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. review and approval processes
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness 

45



of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the Pediatric Research Equity Act does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. However, if only one indication for a product has orphan designation, a pediatric assessment may still be required for any applications to market that same product for the non-orphan indication(s).
The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after it the application is submitted The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions and typically follows the advisory committee’s recommendations.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. After the FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or (an) additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is 

46



issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling or may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also determine that a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools.
Expedited development and review programs
The FDA has a fast track designation program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Unique to a fast track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a fast track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy for a serious condition where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious condition compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.
In addition, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products intended to treat serious or life- threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post- marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires, as a condition for accelerated approval, pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. In addition, this designation may not provide a material commercial advantage.

47



Post-approval requirements
Any drug products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct- to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.
In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the long-term stability of the drug product. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
U.S. Patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents, if granted, may be eligible for limited PTE under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. As compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term, or PTE, which is limited to a maximum of five years, or less if the extended patent term would exceed 14 years after the date of the regulatory approval of the product. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug or drug product, or its approved use, is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of a patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration 

48



date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. However, we may not receive an extension if we fail to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. There can be no assurance that we will benefit from any PTE or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents.
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
Other U.S. Healthcare laws and compliance requirements
Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we are and, upon approval and commercialization, will be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. In the United States, such laws include, without limitation, state and federal fraud and abuse (such as anti-kickback and false claims), privacy and security, price reporting, and provider transparency laws and regulations.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor but the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance in order to offer protection.

49



Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor.
Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute and certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes (discussed below) was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, together with subsequent amendments and regulations, collectively, the ACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (discussed below).
The federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product and for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non- covered, uses.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, also created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.

Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) annually report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, certain ownership and investment interests held by these physicians and their immediate family members. 
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulations promulgated by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, impose requirements on covered entities, including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, and their respective business associates that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity as well as their covered subcontractors relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys 

50



general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, track and report gifts, compensation and other remuneration made to physicians and other healthcare providers, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “quitam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
U.S. and foreign laws, regulations, rules, contractual obligations, policies and other obligations related to data privacy and security.
We are or will become subject to privacy laws in the jurisdictions in which we are established or in which we sell or market our products or run clinical trials. For example, in Europe we are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, in relation to our collection, control, processing and other use of personal data (i.e., data relating to an identified or identifiable living individual). We process personal data in relation to participants in our clinical trials in the European Economic Area, or EEA, including the health and medical information of these participants. The GDPR is directly applicable in each European Union Member State, however, it provides that European Union Member States may introduce further conditions that could cause our compliance costs to increase, ultimately having an adverse impact on our business.
We are subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in those European Union jurisdictions where we are established or otherwise subject to the GDPR. Fines for certain breaches of the GDPR are significant: up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of total global annual turnover. Further, we must comply with both the GDPR and separately the GDPR as implemented in the United Kingdom, or UK, each regime having the ability to fine up to the greater of €20 million / £17 million or 4% of global turnover. A breach of the GDPR or other applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations could result in regulatory investigations, reputational damage, orders to cease/change our use of data, enforcement notices, or potential civil claims including class action type litigation. In general, if our efforts to comply with the GDPR or other applicable European Union laws and regulations are not successful, it could adversely affect our business in the European Union.
In the ordinary course of business, we may transfer personal data from Europe and other jurisdictions to the United States or other countries. Europe and other jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring data to be localized or limiting the transfer of personal data to other countries. In particular, the EEA and the UK have significantly 

51



restricted the transfer of personal data to the United States and other countries whose privacy laws it believes are inadequate. Other jurisdictions may adopt similarly stringent interpretations of their data localization and cross-border data transfer laws. Although there are currently various mechanisms that may be used to transfer personal data from the EEA and UK to the United States in compliance with law, such as the EEA and UK’s standard contractual clauses, these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the United States.
If there is no lawful manner for us to transfer personal data from the EEA, the UK or other jurisdictions to the United States, or if the requirements for a legally-compliant transfer are too onerous, we could face significant adverse consequences, including the interruption or degradation of our operations, the need to relocate part of or all of our business or data processing activities to other jurisdictions at significant expense, increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines and penalties, the inability to transfer data and work with partners, vendors and other third parties, and injunctions against our processing or transferring of personal data necessary to operate our business. Additionally, companies that transfer personal data out of the EEA and UK to other jurisdictions, particularly to the United States, are subject to increased scrutiny from regulators, individual litigants, and activist groups. Some European regulators have ordered certain companies to suspend or permanently cease certain transfers out of Europe for allegedly violating the GDPR’s cross-border data transfer limitations.
In the United States, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, creates individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling certain personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosure to consumers about such companies’ data collection, use and sharing practices, provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information, and provide consumers with additional causes of action. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information. This private right of action may increase the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation. The CCPA (a) allows enforcement by the California Attorney General, with fines set at $2,500 per violation (i.e., per person) or $7,500 per intentional violation and (b) authorizes private lawsuits to recover statutory damages for certain data breaches. 
In addition, laws in all 50 U.S. states require businesses to provide notice to consumers whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. State laws are changing rapidly and there is discussion in the U.S. Congress of a new comprehensive federal data privacy law to which we would become subject if it is enacted. The CCPA may impact our business activities and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information. Additionally, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, significantly modifies the CCPA, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information. The CPRA also creates a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. New legislation proposed or enacted in various other states will continue to shape the data privacy environment nationally. For example, Virginia, Colorado, Utah, and Connecticut have all enacted broad privacy legislation. Certain state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to confidential, sensitive and personal information than federal, international or other state laws, and such laws may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts. In addition to the foregoing, any breach of privacy laws or data security laws, particularly resulting in a significant security incident or breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized use or disclosure of sensitive or confidential patient or consumer information, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and financial condition. As a data controller, we will be accountable for any third-party service providers we engage to process personal data on our behalf, including our CROs. We attempt to mitigate the associated risks but there is no assurance that privacy and security-related safeguards will protect us from all risks associated with the third-party processing, storage and transmission of such information.

52



Pharmaceutical coverage, pricing and reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we or our collaborators obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such drug products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, government authorities, private managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Such payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We or our collaborators may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Nonetheless, our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Moreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the drug product. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
If we elect to participate in certain governmental programs, we may be required to participate in discount and rebate programs, which may result in prices for our future products that will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. For example, drug manufacturers participating under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program must pay rebates on prescription drugs to state Medicaid programs. Under the Veterans Health Care Act, or VHCA, drug companies are required to offer certain drugs at a reduced price to a number of federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense, the Public Health Service and certain private Public Health Service designated entities in order to participate in other federal funding programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Recent legislative changes require that discounted prices be offered for certain U.S. Department of Defense purchases for its TRICARE program via a rebate system. Participation under the VHCA also requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations. If our products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply.
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. Across the European Union, member states carry out assessments of new pharmaceutical products from an economic, public health, and therapeutic perspective, through a Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, process, which is currently governed by the national laws of member states. In December 2021, the European Parliament voted to implement a regulation regarding HTAs, or the HTA Regulation. The HTA Regulation is scheduled to apply as of January 2025, and will provide a framework for pan-EU clinical assessments, scientific consultations, identification of emerging health technologies, and further cooperation. Entry into application of the Regulation could impose stricter and more detailed procedures to be followed by marketing authorization holders concerning conduct of HTAs in relation to their products which may influence related pricing and reimbursement decisions. However, under the HTA Regulation, member states 

53



will still be free to make their own pricing and reimbursement decisions. Moreover, member states may, and do, choose to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems or national healthcare systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of such products. Member states may impose direct controls on pricing, or otherwise adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the companies placing such products on the market. Other member states allow companies to set their own prices but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to medical professionals to limit prescriptions of such products. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
The marketability of any product candidates for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Healthcare reform
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products and services, implementing reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and applying new payment methodologies. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which affected existing government healthcare programs and resulted in the development of new programs.
There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, on June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. In addition, there have been a number of health reform initiatives by the Biden administration that have impacted the ACA. For example, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or the IRA, into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business.


Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and will remain in effect through 2031. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024.
There has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which pharmaceutical companies set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Presidential executive orders, Congressional inquiries and proposed federal legislation, as well as state efforts, designed to, among other 

54



things, bring more transparency to product pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order that included multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform. The plan sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. In addition, the IRA, among other things (i) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and (ii) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. In addition, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
In addition, it is possible that there will be further legislation or regulation that could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Europe / rest of world government regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we or our potential collaborators obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. 
Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, pursuant to the Clinical Trials Regulation, which came into application on January 31, 2022, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to via the EMA's Clinical Trials Information System, which will cover all regulatory and ethics assessments from the member states concerned. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. Approval and monitoring of clinical trials in the European Union is the responsibility of individual member states but, compared to the position prior to the applicability of the Clinical Trials Regulation, there is likely to be more collaboration, information-sharing, and decision-making between member states.
The requirements and processes governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all major territories, including the European Union, clinical trials 

55



must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
The European Union and the European Economic Area consist, at the time of writing, of the twenty-seven Member States of the European Union, plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein which are Member States of the European Economic Area. To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application either under the so-called centralized or national authorization procedures. There are three procedures for a marketing authorization to be obtained:




● | The Centralized marketing authorization, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the scientific opinion of the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the European Economic Area. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as (i) biotechnology medicinal products such as genetic engineering, (ii) orphan medicinal products, (iii) medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune and viral diseases and (iv) advanced-therapy medicines, such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy or tissue-engineered medicines. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the European Union, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union.

● | Decentralized Procedure marketing authorizations are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. An identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the marketing authorization is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS, to lead the evaluation of the regulatory submission. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SmPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet as distilled from the preliminary evaluation, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Concerned Member States) for their approval. If the Concerned Member States raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the RMS records the agreement, closes the procedure and informs the applicant accordingly. Each Member State concerned by the procedure is required to adopt a national decision to grant a national marketing authorization in conformity with the approved assessment report, SmPC and the labeling and package leaflet as approved. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the European Economic Area, the granted national marketing authorization can be used for mutual recognition in other Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure, or MRP, resulting in progressive national approval of the product in the European Economic Area.

● | National marketing authorizations, which are issued by a single competent authority of the Member States of the European Economic Area and only covers such authority’s respective territory, are also available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Once a product has been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the European Economic Area through the National Procedure, this National marketing authorization can also be recognized in other Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure.

​
The EMA grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that may offer therapeutic benefits for life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the European Union. In addition, orphan drug designation can be granted if the drug is intended for a life threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and without incentives it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify developing the drug. Orphan drug designation is only available if there is no other satisfactory method approved in the European Union of diagnosing, preventing or treating the condition, or if such a method exists, the proposed orphan drug will be of significant benefit to patients. Orphan drug designation provides opportunities for free protocol assistance, fee reductions for access to the centralized regulatory procedures and ten years of market 

56



exclusivity following drug approval, which can be extended to 12 years if trials are conducted in accordance with an agreed-upon pediatric investigational plan. The exclusivity period may be reduced to six years if the designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all major territories, clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Employees and Human Capital 
As of January 31, 2023, we had 86 employees, 83 of whom were full time, consisting of clinical, research, operations, regulatory, finance and business development personnel. Thirty-two of our employees hold Ph.D. or M.D. degrees. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Our commitment to innovation begins with the commitment to creating an environment with the ability to attract and retain highly skilled people, including top scientific talent, as a critical factor for us to deliver on our mission and create value.
As we have grown significantly since our initial public offering in November 2020, we have focused on diversity, inclusion and belonging both at the Board level, where we appointed three global biotech female leaders to our Board, and for all employees. We have been successful in hiring employees with a broad diversity of experiences and backgrounds. We face significant competition for biotechnology talent from both established and early-stage biotechnology companies. Further, we are headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area and have operations in Cambridge, Massachusetts, both global biotechnology hubs with many employment choices. Despite our early stage, we have been successful in hiring highly qualified staff to join Olema. As of January 31, 2023, 54% of our employee population is male, and 46% is female.
We strive to create a positive employee experience by fostering an inclusive and equitable culture. We are committed to the health, safety, and well-being of our employees, with a particular focus on COVID-19 related protections and precautions for our workforce. This commitment is reflected in our ability to attract and retain high performers. We believe we have a robust employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of our employees’ lives, including healthcare, paid time-off, retirement savings with a company match through a 401(k) plan, our equity incentive plans, and our employee stock purchase plan. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, motivate and retain our employees and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards. From time to time, we may offer additional stock-based compensation awards to our employees to continue to motivate them and support retention, particularly at times when our stock price, or the stock price of biotechnology companies generally, is volatile. We grant stock options to all full-time employees to foster alignment and promote a spirit of ownership.
