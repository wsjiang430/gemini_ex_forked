Item 1. Business 
Overview
Founded in 1986 by John Reed, our current Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and his father, Arhaus, Inc. (“Arhaus,” “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a rapidly growing lifestyle brand and omni-channel retailer of premium home furnishings. We were founded on a simple idea: furniture should be responsibly sourced, lovingly made and built to last. Today, we partner with artisans around the world who share our vision, creating beautiful, premium and heirloom-quality home furnishings that clients can use for generations. On November 4, 2021, the Company completed its initial public offering (“IPO”) of its Class A common stock, which is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (the “Nasdaq”) under the symbol “ARHS.”
Our vertical model, consisting of our design and product development teams, upholstery manufacturing capabilities, direct vendor sourcing, and direct-to-consumer selling, allows us to offer a differentiated approach to furniture and décor. We offer merchandise in a number of categories, including furniture, outdoor, lighting, textiles, and décor. Our curated assortments are presented across our sales channels in sophisticated, family friendly and unique lifestyle settings. 
Based on third-party reports and publicly available data, we estimate the U.S. premium home furnishing market is approximately $100 billion, with the potential to grow at a compounded annual growth rate, or CAGR, of approximately 6% between 2022 and 2025. This attractive market is highly fragmented, served by many small independent furniture stores, which favorably positions us to grow profitably and gain market share. We believe we are well positioned within this market due to our unique approach, momentum, scale and growth strategies.
Our products are designed to be used and enjoyed throughout the home and are sourced directly from a network of more than 400 vendors with no wholesale or dealer markup. Our product development teams work alongside our direct sourcing partners to bring to market proprietary merchandise that is a great value to clients. These relationships, along with our vertical model, allow us to provide higher quality products at more competitive prices than both smaller independent operators and larger competitors.
We believe in providing a dynamic and welcoming experience in our Showrooms and online with the conviction that retail is theater. Our national omni-channel business positions our retail locations as Showrooms for our brand, while our website acts as a virtual extension of our Showrooms. Our theater-like Showrooms are highly inspirational and function as an invaluable brand awareness vehicle. Our seasoned sales associates and in-home designers provide expert advice and assistance to our client base that drives significant client engagement. Our omni-channel model allows clients to begin or end their shopping journey online, while also experiencing our theater-like Showrooms throughout the shopping journey. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 81 Showrooms, 65 with in-home interior designers. Our Showrooms span 29 states and consist of 72 traditional showrooms, 6 Design Studios and 3 Outlets. 
Our business witnessed strong performance over the last three years. Our net revenue was $1,228.9 million, $796.9 million, and $507.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Demand comparable growth was 13.8%, 45.3%, and 24.7% in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Comparable growth was 51.6%, 51.0% and 0.9% in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our long-standing direct sourcing partnerships were a significant contributor to our success, as many of our vendors increased capacity to help facilitate our net revenue growth. We benefited from these important, long-term relationships as our vendors worked with us to help meet the unprecedented increase in client demand and significant backlog. 
During 2020, we experienced COVID-19 related disruptions to our business. In March 2020, we temporarily closed all of our Showrooms and Outlets. By June 30, 2020, we reopened all of our Showrooms and Outlet stores. We are proud of the incredible loyalty of our client base and our financial momentum over the past several years. 
Our Competitive Strengths
A Differentiated Concept Delivering Livable Luxury
We provide a differentiated concept, redefining the premium home furnishing market by offering an attractive combination of design, quality, value and convenience. Artisan-crafted and globally curated, our products are highly differentiated from both small and large competitors. We create merchandise that offers livable luxury style with elements of durability and practicality. We serve our clients through our Showrooms, eCommerce platform, print and digital media and high-quality client service. In a 

market characterized by small, independent competitors, we believe our premium lifestyle positioning, artisan-crafted style, superior quality, significant scale and level of convenience will enable us to increase our market share.
Highly Experiential Omni-Channel Approach
We strive to offer our products to our clients via our omni-channel approach and operate our business in a channel agnostic way. Leveraging our proprietary data and technology, we are able to meet our clients wherever they want to shop, whether online or in one of our 81 Showrooms. Our product development and omni-channel go-to-market capabilities, together with our fully integrated infrastructure and significant scale, enable us to offer a compelling combination of design, quality and value that we believe provides an unmatched experience.
Showroom. Our theater-like Showrooms, which average approximately 16,100 square feet, act as an exceptionally strong brand-building tool and drive significant traffic. Our Showrooms provide clients with an unparalleled experience, conveying our livable luxury concept designed to showcase product. Our highly trained and creative visual managers walk the floors daily to determine new ways to visually optimize and maximize the appeal and inspirational nature of our Showrooms. In addition to visual managers, we also employ enthusiastic and knowledgeable sales associates that fully engage our clients and provide expert service and advice.
eCommerce. Our online capabilities are a critical entry point into our ecosystem, providing our clients research and discovery tools and allowing them to begin or complete transactions online. Our online design services professionals and virtual tools complement our eCommerce platform by engaging clients and providing them with expert design advice and capabilities. Driven by investment in our digital platform, we believe we can increase our eCommerce penetration over time, accelerating growth and allowing clients to transact when, where and how they choose.
Print and Digital Media. We distribute two large catalogs each year, a January and a September edition, in both an online and physical format to millions of households, which has yielded strong results. We also distribute catalogs for specific categories such as outdoor furnishings, special collections and certain holidays. In addition, we advertise consistently across digital platforms and regularly partner with social media influencers to drive brand awareness. We employ a targeted approach with our print and digital media and also identify lifestyle-driven opportunities to reach potential clients, such as sending postcards or small mailers to people who have recently moved. Our print and digital media strategy drives both Showroom and eCommerce net revenue as it raises brand awareness and showcases new merchandise.
In-home Designer Services. We welcome all clients to use our complimentary in-home designer services with no appointment required. Our in-home designers, who work with clients in the Showroom and travel to our clients’ residences, work in unison with our Showrooms and eCommerce platform to drive client conversion, order size and overall experience. In-home designer services provide a more personalized client experience and since 2017 have produced average order values (AOVs) over three times that of a standard order. Clients that engage with our in-home designer services program exhibit a significantly higher repurchase rate, with approximately 40% making five or more purchases throughout their client lifetime. As of December 31, 2022, we had 84 in-home designers in 65 Showrooms compared to 54 in-home designers in 45 Showrooms as of December 31, 2020.
Strong Direct Global Sourcing Relationships
Our direct global sourcing relationships allow us to provide superior quality, differentiated customization and attractive value. We have longstanding relationships with our vendors which allow us a number of competitive advantages, including the ability to maintain consistent quality and ensure the majority of our products, approximately 95% based on net revenue in 2022, can only be purchased from Arhaus. Coupled with our direct global sourcing network, we maintain highly adept in-house product design and development experts that partner with our vendors to innovate and create highly customized offerings. 
Superior and Consistent Unit Economics
Our inspirational, theater-like Showrooms have generated robust unit-level financial results, strong free cash flow and attractive, rapid returns on our investment. We have been successful across all geographic regions we have entered and have proven to be resilient to competitive entrants. Our Showrooms have performed well in large and small markets, urban and suburban locations and across various Showroom formats and layouts. Our average unit volumes are relatively consistent across the Northeast, West, Midwest and South regions. Further, our fully integrated and seamless omni-channel experience contributes significant uplift in our markets.
Our Growth Strategies
We believe there is a significant opportunity to drive sustainable growth and profitability by executing on the following strategies:
Increase Brand Awareness to Drive Net Revenue
We will continue to increase our brand awareness through an omni-channel approach which includes the growth of our Showroom footprint, enhanced digital marketing, improvement in website features and analytics and continued product assortment optimization:
Expand Showroom Footprint. Our Showrooms are a key component of our brand. We believe the expansion of our Showroom footprint will give more clients the opportunity to experience our inspirational and premium lifestyle concept, thereby increasing brand awareness and driving net revenue.
Enhance Digital Marketing Capabilities. Digital advertising, search, on-site offerings, and social media engagement are important branding and advertising vehicles. Using these engagement methods within our omni-channel model contributes significantly to our brand awareness, evidenced by approximately 80% of our eCommerce demand originating within 50 miles of a Showroom. We believe that continued investment in brand marketing, data-led insights and effective consumer targeting will expand and strengthen our client reach.
Grow eCommerce Platform. eCommerce represents our fastest growing channel, with net revenue increasing by approximately 43% in 2022 compared to 2021. We believe recent growth is related to our new website launched in the fourth quarter of 2021, our enhanced marketing efforts, attractive product assortment and improving brand awareness. We believe our digital platform provides clients with a convenient way to interact with our brand and full product assortment. Our eCommerce platform enables our clients to shop anywhere at any time and begin or complete transactions online. Our new website creates a more interactive process through the use of virtual shopping tools that allow clients to visualize our products in their homes. Our website is key to our omni-channel model and helps drive Showroom traffic, increases client engagement and streamlines product feedback, which ultimately results in client conversion. 
Optimize Product Assortment. We continue building our product assortment to attract new clients and encourage repeat purchases from existing clients. We plan to expand our product portfolio across select categories and to continue to refine our existing product offering with new designs, materials, fabrics and colors to capture constantly evolving trends and client preferences.
Expand our Showroom Base and Capture Market Share
We have a Showroom presence in all four major geographic regions, and our top 10 Showrooms by net revenue are located in 9 different states. We have a significant whitespace opportunity both in existing and new markets. We have built a comprehensive and sophisticated infrastructure which we believe can support approximately 90 incremental Showrooms in over 40 new metropolitan statistical areas across the United States, 27 of which are currently in our pipeline. Our long-term plan anticipates opening between five to seven new Showrooms each year for the foreseeable future.
We employ a data-driven, thorough process to select and develop new Showroom locations. In selecting new locations, we evaluate data on specific market characteristics, demographics, client penetration and growth, along with considering the brand impact and opportunity of specific sites. In addition to our current Showroom model, our Design Studio format (approximately 5,000 sq. ft.) is an extension of our in-home design services and carries a highly curated product selection in smaller, attractive markets.
Enhance Omni-Channel Capabilities and Technology to Drive Growth
We have several initiatives that continue to enhance our omni-channel capabilities. Our approach begins in our visually captivating, theater-like Showrooms. Our Showrooms drive brand awareness and create meaningful marketing buzz and volume uplift when we open in new markets. Our unit growth strategy is highly complementary to our digital eCommerce platform. As Showrooms open in new markets, we experience significant growth in our eCommerce business and overall client engagement across channels. 
Clients increasingly engage with us through digital methods including our website and social media. To capitalize on these trends and continue increasing our client base, we are investing in data analytics to improve the client journey from the moment 

clients begin browsing online or enter our Showrooms. This will allow us to target clients with personalized digital offerings to increase online conversion and client lifetime value.
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we launched a new website to enhance our virtual Showroom experience. Our new website creates a more interactive shopping process through the use of virtual shopping tools to aid clients in visualizing our products in their homes.
To further strengthen client engagement and increase client interactions, we continue to expand our designer programs, both in-home and online. Similar in concept to our in-home designer program, our online designer platform provides clients with expert service and advice from our design professionals via online video chat and virtual design capabilities. We believe bolstering this component of the client experience will drive higher client satisfaction and result in larger total company AOV over time. 
We are also investing in Showroom technology, including the installation of touch screen TVs and other augmented reality tools to enhance the client experience. Our new Design Studio format, which also leverages these state-of-the-art tools, has experienced overwhelmingly positive client receptivity, with the new format outperforming our expectations. We see tremendous growth potential across our omni-channel platform by increasing our ability to make data-driven decisions and maintaining a comprehensive focus on the client journey. We will continue to innovate and invest in value-added digital and technological capabilities across our omni-channel footprint. 
Leverage Investments to Grow Net Revenue and Enhance Margins
We have the opportunity to further drive net revenue and enhance operating margins by continuing to focus on our distribution efficiency and manufacturing capacity.
Enhanced Distribution Efficiency and Capacity. We have made, and will continue to make, investments in our infrastructure including our distribution network, IT capabilities and geographic footprint to improve operational efficiency and ready our platform for the next stage of growth. Our existing distribution center and corporate office in Ohio was expanded by approximately 229,500 square feet in 2022. Our new North Carolina facility opened in December 2021 and has approximately 307,000 square feet of distribution capacity. Furthermore, our new Texas distribution center, opened in July 2022, added approximately 800,700 square feet. The additional distribution centers will help streamline shipping times and further support our rapidly growing demand and footprint.
Increasing Domestic Manufacturing Capacity. Our new North Carolina facility doubled our in-house upholstery manufacturing capacity, improved our production efficiency and increased production square footage from 150,000 to 190,000.
Our Industry and Market Opportunity 
We operate within the approximately $400 billion U.S. home furnishings and décor market. We primarily compete in the large, growing and highly fragmented premium segment of this market, which we estimate accounts for approximately $100 billion of the total market based on third-party estimates of retail sales in 2022, publicly available industry data and our internal research. We believe that the premium segment has a potential CAGR of approximately 6% between 2022 and 2025. 
Our Products, Sourcing and Product Development
We are a lifestyle brand and omni-channel retailer of premium home furnishings focused on providing livable luxury to clients. Our unique concept is dedicated to bringing clients heirloom quality, artisan-made furniture and décor. We travel the globe gathering inspiration for and curating our collection, as well as selecting vendors that provide quality materials and artisan craftsmanship. We have longstanding relationships with our vendors which allow us a number of competitive advantages, including the ability to maintain consistent quality and ensure the majority of our products, approximately 95% based on net revenue in 2022, can only be purchased from Arhaus. We offer a wide range of product categories designed to be used and enjoyed throughout the home, including furniture, outdoor, lighting, textiles, and décor. 
Our furniture product offerings are comprised of bedroom, dining room, living room and home office furnishings and include sofas, dining tables and chairs, accent chairs, console and coffee tables, beds, headboards, dressers, desks, bookcases and modular storage, among many more items. Our outdoor product offerings include outdoor dining tables, chairs, chaises and other furniture, lighting, textiles, décor, umbrellas and fire pits. Our lighting product offerings consist of a variety of distinct and artistic lighting fixtures, including chandeliers, pendants, table and floor lamps, and sconces. Our textile product offerings include handcrafted indoor and outdoor rugs, bed linens, and pillows and throws. Décor ranges from wall art to mirrors, vases to candles, and many other decorative accessories. 

Many of our products are conceived of, and developed by, our in-house design team of over 40 highly skilled and experienced members. We have and will continue to significantly invest in our product development capabilities, including key strategic hires made over the past few years. We believe these investments will allow us to enhance our competitive advantages of offering clients premium quality and customized product at a compelling value and ultimately drive net revenue growth.
Our sourcing strategy focuses on identifying and working with vendors, both in-house and external, who share our vision for creating heirloom-quality products with artisan craftsmanship. We seek to ensure the quality of our vendors’ products through periodic site visits, audits and inspections. We source these products directly, with no wholesale or dealer markup. This allows us to offer an exclusive assortment of products to our clients at an attractive value. 
We have a diversified base of over 400 vendors, and our top 10 vendors represent approximately 60% of our net revenue. Only one of our vendors accounts for more than 10% of our net revenue, and one other vendor accounts for more than 5% of net revenue. In 2022, approximately 40% of our net revenues and products were produced or sourced from vendors located in the U.S.
In addition to product design and development, we have upholstery manufacturing capabilities which allow us to create intricate, high quality products at attractive prices and margins. Our ability to innovate, curate products, categories, and services, then rapidly scale across our fully integrated omni-channel infrastructure is a powerful platform for continued long-term growth. Our vertical model and direct sourcing furnish clients with superior quality products and compelling value at attractive profit margins. We reported gross margin as a percent of net revenue of 42.7%, 41.4% and 39.3% for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Omni-Channel Approach 
We distribute our products through an omni-channel model, and our clients can purchase our products in our Showrooms, through our eCommerce platform, via print and digital media and by utilizing our in-home designer services. Our retail locations are Showrooms for our brand, and our website acts as a virtual extension of our Showrooms. Our omni-channel model allows clients to begin or end their shopping experience online while also experiencing our theater-like Showrooms throughout the shopping process. We believe our omni-channel approach enables us to offer a compelling combination of design, quality and value.
Showrooms
As of December 31, 2022, we operated 81 Showrooms in 29 states. Our Showroom composition includes 72 traditional showrooms, 6 Design Studios and 3 Outlets. Our average Showroom size is approximately 16,100 square feet. Our theater-like Showrooms are highly inspirational and function as an invaluable brand awareness vehicle. Our Showrooms convey our carefully curated, livable luxury concept in a tangible format designed to showcase product in fully appointed rooms and to help clients reimagine their homes. Each Showroom may vary in product display and design elements depending on regional factors influencing client design preferences. Our Showroom layouts are constantly updated as our highly trained and creative visual managers determine new ways to optimize and maximize the appeal and inspirational nature of our Showrooms. Through our investment in technology, including the installation of touch screen TVs and other augmented reality tools, our seasoned sales associates provide valued insight and advice to our client base that drive significant client engagement.

eCommerce
Our website allows our clients to shop our current product assortment and experience the unique lifestyle settings reflected in our Showrooms and print media. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we launched a new website to enhance our virtual Showroom experience. Our new website creates a more interactive shopping process through the use of virtual shopping tools to aid clients in visualizing our products in their homes.
Our website also provides our clients with the ability to chat with a designer through our online design services tools. We update our website regularly to reflect new products, product availability and special offers. 
Print and Digital Media
Our January and September catalogs are distributed in both digital and physical formats. In addition to our two seasonal catalogs, we distribute catalogs for specific categories such as outdoor furnishings, special collections and certain holidays. We employ a targeted approach with our print and digital media and also identify lifestyle-driven opportunities to reach potential clients, such as sending postcards or small mailers to people who have recently moved. We also employ a digital strategy to reach clients and potential clients through social media, influencers and other digital marketing. We design and produce our catalogs and print and digital media in-house to ensure consistency with our brand. 
In-home Designer Services
Our in-home designers, who work with clients in the Showroom and travel to our clients’ residences, work in unison with our Showrooms and eCommerce platform to drive client conversion, order size and overall experience. Our in-home designer services provide a more personalized client experience and, since 2017, have produced AOVs over three times that of a standard order. We welcome all clients to use our complimentary in-home designer services with no appointment required.

Real Estate Strategy
Our Showrooms have historically been in high traffic locations, and we favor top tier locations near luxury and contemporary retailers that we believe are consistent with our target clients’ demographic and shopping preferences.
From January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2022, we successfully opened or relocated 14 new Showrooms in 14 markets, including 10 new markets. Our recent Showroom growth is summarized in the following table:

 | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2021
Showrooms open at beginning of period | 79 | 74 
Showrooms opened (1) | 4 | 10 
Showrooms closed for relocations | (1) | | (3)
Showrooms closed permanently | (1) | | (2)
Showrooms open at end of period | 81 | 79 

(1) Showrooms opened during the respective periods includes both new and relocated Showrooms.
Based on recently commissioned studies and surveys conducted on our behalf, we believe there is potential to more than double our current Showroom base to over 165 locations in both new and existing markets. Illustrated by the success of our geographically diverse Showroom footprint, our omni-channel model has performed well in every region of the country, across retail formats and across market sizes. At December 31, 2022, our top 10 Showrooms by net revenue are located in 9 different states, and our model has proven successful in a variety of markets and economic cycles. Our goal is to open an average of five to seven new Showrooms per year for the foreseeable future, which indicates we could fulfill the whitespace potential within the next 15 years. We are disciplined in our approach to opening Showrooms in top tier locations and expect to continue our prudent approach as we continue to grow our Showroom footprint. 
Distribution and Delivery
We manage the distribution and delivery of our products through our distribution centers in Boston Heights, Ohio, Dallas, Texas and Conover, North Carolina. Additionally, we partner with third-party vendors to provide home delivery services to our clients. These distribution centers serve all of our channels. Our Boston Heights, Ohio facility is approximately 1,003,500 square feet after our expansion, approximately 900,000 square feet of this facility is dedicated to distribution (the remainder serves as our corporate headquarters). Our Dallas, Texas facility is approximately 800,700 square feet and is managed by a third party. Our facility in North Carolina has approximately 497,000 square feet of space, with approximately 307,000 square feet dedicated to distribution.
Marketing and Advertising
We use a variety of marketing and advertising approaches to drive client traffic across all of our channels, strengthen and reinforce brand awareness, attract new clients and encourage repeat purchases from existing clients. We believe our Showrooms, catalogs, mailings, digital offerings and social media engagement, among other things, act as important branding and advertising vehicles.
Our print and digital media strategy serves as a key driver of net revenue through both our Showrooms and website. Our clients respond to the catalogs mailings and digital offerings across all of our channels, with net revenue trends closely correlating to the assortments that we emphasize and feature prominently in our media. We continue to evaluate and optimize our print and digital media strategy based on our experience.
In addition, we will continue to increase our brand awareness by expanding our Showroom footprint, enhancing digital marketing, and from our improved website features and analytics. We believe that increased brand awareness will lead to higher net revenue in our Showrooms and eCommerce business over time.
Seasonality
Our quarterly results depend upon a variety of factors, including the opening of new Showroom locations, the introduction of new merchandise assortments and categories, changes in our product offerings, shifts in quarter over quarter timing of various events such as holidays, Showroom closures, catalog releases, promotional events and the realization of the costs and benefits of our numerous strategic initiatives, among other things. As a result of these factors, our working capital requirements and demands on our product distribution and delivery network may fluctuate during the year. Unique factors in any given quarter 

may affect comparisons between the quarters, and the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that we may achieve for a full year.
Competition
The U.S. home furnishings and décor market is highly fragmented and competitive with approximately 22,000 retail establishments as of 2021, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics. We compete with national, regional and local home furnishing retailers, department stores, mail-order catalogs, online retailers focused on home furnishings, interior design trade and specialty showrooms, antique dealers and other merchants that provide unique items and custom-designed product offerings. 
We believe we compete primarily on the basis of our design, quality and value. Our vertical model and deep network of direct sourcing relationships allow us to bring to market higher quality products at more competitive price points than our competitors. We believe our distinctive brand based on livable luxury, our strong direct global sourcing relationships, and our highly experiential omni-channel approach allow us to compete effectively and differentiate ourselves from competitors.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property has significant value and we vigorously protect it against infringement. The “Arhaus®,” “Arhaus Furniture®,” “Arhaus the Loft®,” “Arhaus Your Home®” and “Arhaus Table®” trademarks are registered in the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The “Arhaus®” trademark is also registered with the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) and the Canadian Intellectual Property Office.

In addition, we own the domain names “arhaus.com,” “arhaus.net,” and “arhausfurniture.com.” These domain names are renewable. 
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2,120 employees and 60 temporary employees, including approximately 130 part-time employees. As of that date, approximately 870 of our employees were based in our Showrooms, 500 of our employees were based in our distribution centers, 250 of our employees were based in our manufacturing facility, and 560 of our employees were based in our corporate headquarters. None of our employees are represented by a union, and we have had no labor-related work stoppages. We believe our relationship with our employees is positive.
We are currently managed by a group of experienced senior executives, including our Founder, Chairman and CEO, John Reed, and other key team members with substantial knowledge and understanding of the Company and the industry sector in which we operate. Our success and future growth depend largely upon the continued services of our management team, as well as our qualified associates across all parts of our organization, including our Showrooms, distribution centers and manufacturing facilities, many of whom have been promoted from within Arhaus.
Response to COVID-19 Pandemic
We remain focused on protecting our employees against COVID-19 and ensuring a healthy work environment. Our business leaders manage items such as developing health and safety protocols, responding to health and safety issues, interpreting government orders, and securing personal protective equipment as necessary as the pandemic evolves. We developed a comprehensive handbook to set and communicate work procedures necessary to facilitate COVID-19 health and safety measures, including proper social distancing during periods of high infection rates. When employees test positive for COVID-19, we follow adopted procedures including enhanced disinfecting that targets applicable areas. The affected employee is required to observe a quarantine period, monitor symptoms, and follow medical guidance prior to returning to work.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We believe that much of our success is rooted in the diversity of our teams and our commitment to a diverse and inclusive culture. We value diversity at all levels and focus on extending our diversity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce. We continue to foster a culture of inclusion, diversity, and equity in which everyone is respected, valued, and has an equal opportunity to contribute and thrive. Our commitment is unwavering, and we are steadfast in maintaining our focus on building a workforce that represents the many customers we serve and the communities in which we operate.
We view continuous dialogue as an important tool in cultivating an inclusive culture. In 2019, we established an inclusion and diversity team comprised of a broad group of employees, including management, to encourage discussion and elicit feedback on Company policies to further our efforts to: (i) ensure that we have a safe and inclusive workplace; (ii) equip our people to 

attract, develop, retain, and reward a diverse and inclusive workforce; (iii) be an inclusive and equitable corporate citizen; (iv) develop a governance and accountability model that will sustain inclusion and diversity; and (v) enhance our business results.
We are committed to equal opportunity and base workplace decisions solely on merit, qualifications, and other job-related, neutral, non-discriminatory criteria. We provide equal employment opportunity without regard to age, race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, citizenship, pregnancy, religion, disability, military status, genetic information, or other status protected by law. We are committed to providing a harassment-free work environment, and we prohibit retaliation, intimidation, threats, coercion, or discrimination against individuals who, in good faith, complain of unlawful discrimination or harassment.
Regulation and Legislation
We are subject to numerous regulations, including labor and employment laws, customs and trade laws, laws governing truth-in-advertising, consumer protection, privacy, safety, real estate, environmental and zoning and occupancy laws, and other laws and regulations that regulate retailers and govern the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of our Showrooms, manufacturing and distribution facilities in the United States and jurisdictions where we source products. We have policies intended to ensure that we conduct business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. While we cannot predict policy changes by various regulatory agencies or unexpected operational or other developments, we believe we are in material compliance with laws applicable to our business.
Environmental, Health, and Safety Regulation
Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to health, safety and the protection of the environment. These environmental, health and safety laws and regulations include those relating to, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment; and the health and safety of our employees. Liability for the improper release or disposal of waste can be joint and several, and there can be no assurance that we will not have to expend material amounts to remediate the consequences of the generation or disposal of waste in the future. Further, we may be responsible as a lessee operator for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances located on or in or emanating from leased property, as well as any property damage. There can be no assurance that our future operations or property conditions will not result in the imposition of liability upon us under environmental laws or expose us to third-party actions.
We are also subject to certain reporting and labeling requirements under California’s Proposition 65, officially known as the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986. Proposition 65 requires manufacturers, distributors, vendors, and retailers of a consumer product in California that contains certain listed chemicals to provide consumers with a clear and reasonable warning if exposure to that listed chemical poses a certain level of risk to the consumer. We have taken measures to comply with the requirements of Proposition 65, but there is no guarantee that we will not be subject to fines, penalties, and lawsuits and complaints in the future.
Failure to comply with such laws and regulations, which tend to become more stringent over time, can result in significant fines, penalties, costs, and liabilities, which may be joint and several, or restrictions on operations, civil or criminal sanctions, and could expose us to costs of investigation or remediation, as well as tort claims, and could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
