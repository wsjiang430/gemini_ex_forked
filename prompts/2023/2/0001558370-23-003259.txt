Item 1.   Business
Overview and Strategy
XOMA is a biotech royalty aggregator. We have a sizable portfolio of economic rights to future potential milestone and royalty payments associated with partnered commercial and pre-commercial therapeutic candidates. Our 

6



portfolio was built through acquisitions of rights to future milestones and royalties that we have made since our royalty aggregator business model was implemented in 2017 combined with outlicensing our proprietary products and platforms from our legacy discovery and development business. We expect that most of our future revenue will be based on payments we may receive for milestones and royalties related to these programs. 
Our strategy is to expand our portfolio by acquiring additional potential milestone and royalty revenue streams on drug product candidates from third parties. Expanding our portfolio through these acquisitions can allow for further diversification across therapeutic areas and development stages. Our ideal target acquisitions are in pre-commercial stages of development, have an expected long duration of market exclusivity, have high revenue potential, and are partnered with a large pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical enterprise.

Acquisitions

ObsEva Intellectual Property Acquisition Agreement 
In November 2022, we entered into the ObsEva IP Acquisition Agreement pursuant to which we acquired all of ObsEva’s intellectual property (patents and know-how) and license agreement rights related to ebopiprant, an investigational compound previously licensed by ObsEva from Merck KGaA. We also assumed ObsEva’s ongoing obligations under the Organon License Agreement and the Merck KGaA License Agreement. Pursuant to the Organon License Agreement, XOMA is eligible to receive up to $475.0 million in payments for ebopiprant development, commercialization and sales-based milestones. If ebopiprant is successfully commercialized, we will be entitled to receive royalties that range from low to mid-teens from Organon and will be required to make mid-single-digit royalty payments to Merck KGaA. We paid ObsEva a $15.0 million upfront payment at closing and will pay potential earn-out payments of up to $97.5 million for development, regulatory and sales-based milestones, representing a portion of what we will receive pursuant to the Organon License Agreement.
Affitech Commercial Payment Purchase Agreement 
In October 2021, we entered into the Affitech CPPA, pursuant to which we purchased a future stream of commercial payment rights to Roche’s faricimab from Affitech for an upfront payment of $6.0 million. We are eligible to receive commercial payments from Roche consisting of 0.50% of future net sales of faricimab for a ten-year period following the first commercial sales in each applicable jurisdiction. 
In January 2022, Genentech, a member of the Roche group, received approval from the FDA to commercialize VABYSMO (faricimab-svoa) for the treatment of wet, or neovascular, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema. Pursuant to the Affitech CPPA, we paid Affitech a $5.0 million milestone tied to these U.S. marketing approvals.
In September 2022, in connection with Roche receiving approval from the European Commission to commercialize VABYSMO for the treatment of neovascular or ‘wet’ age-related macular degeneration and visual impairment due to diabetic macular edema, we made a $3.0 million milestone payment to Affitech pursuant to the terms of the Affitech CPPA. As a result of the EC Approval, we are eligible to receive a 0.5% commercial payment stream for ten years from the first commercial sale of VABYSMO in Europe. 

8



In August 2022, we received $0.5 million from Roche representing the first commercial payment for sales of VABYSMO during the first six months of 2022, and in February 2023 we received $2.4 million for sales of VABYSMO during the second half of 2022.
Kuros Royalty Purchase Agreement

In July 2021, we entered into the Kuros RPA, pursuant to which we acquired the rights to 100% of the potential future royalties from commercial sales, which are tiered from high single-digit to low double-digits, and up to $25.5 million in pre-commercial milestone payments associated with an existing license agreement related to Checkmate Pharmaceuticals’ vidutolimod (CMP-001), a Toll-like receptor 9 agonist, packaged in a virus-like particle, for an upfront payment of $7.0 million. We may pay additional sales-based milestones to Kuros of up to $142.5 million representing a portion of the future royalties on commercial sales.

In May 2022, Regeneron completed its acquisition of Checkmate Pharmaceuticals resulting in a $5.0 million milestone payment to Kuros. Pursuant to the Kuros RPA, we were entitled to 50% of the milestone payment, which we received in July 2022. 
Viracta Royalty Purchase Agreement
In March 2021, we entered into the Viracta RPA, pursuant to which we acquired the right to receive future royalties, milestones, and other payments related to two clinical-stage drug candidates for $13.5 million. The first candidate, DAY101 (pan-RAF kinase inhibitor), is being developed by Day One Biopharmaceuticals, and the second candidate, vosaroxin (topoisomerase II inhibitor), is being developed by Denovo Biopharma. We acquired the right to receive (i) up to $54.0 million in potential milestones, potential royalties on sales, if approved, and other payments related to DAY101, excluding up to $20.0 million consideration retained by Viracta, and (ii) up to $57.0 million in potential regulatory and commercial milestones and high single-digit royalties on sales related to vosaroxin, if approved. 
Agenus Royalty Purchase Agreement
In September 2018, we entered into the Agenus RPA, pursuant to which we acquired the right to receive 33% of the future royalties due to Agenus from Incyte (net of certain royalties payable by Agenus to a third party) and 10% of all future developmental, regulatory and sales milestones on sales of six Incyte immuno-oncology assets. In addition, we acquired the right to receive 33% of the future royalties due to Agenus from Merck and 10% of all future developmental, regulatory and sales milestones on sales of MK-4830, an immuno-oncology product currently in clinical development. Pursuant to the Agenus Royalty Purchase Agreement, our share in future potential development, regulatory and commercial milestones is up to $59.5 million, and the royalties have no limit. Under the terms of the Agenus Royalty Purchase Agreement, we paid Agenus $15.0 million. 
In November 2020, MK-4830 advanced to Phase 2 development stage. As a result of the advancement, Agenus earned a $10.0 million clinical development milestone pursuant to its license agreement with Merck, of which we received $1.0 million. 
Bioasis Royalty Purchase Agreement
In February 2019, we entered into the Bioasis RPA, pursuant to which we acquired future milestone, royalty and option fee payment rights from Bioasis for product candidates that are being developed pursuant to a License Agreement between Bioasis and Prothena Biosciences Limited. Under the terms of the Bioasis RPA, we paid Bioasis an upfront cash payment of $0.3 million and will be required to make contingent future cash payments of up to $0.2 million to Bioasis if and when the licensed product candidates reach certain development milestones. As of December 31, 2021, none of the development milestones had been achieved. In addition, we were granted an option to purchase a 1% royalty right on the next two license agreements entered into between Bioasis and third-party licensees subject to certain payments and conditions as well as a right of first negotiation on the purchase of royalty rights on subsequent Bioasis license agreements with third parties.

9



In November 2020, we entered into the Second Bioasis RPA, pursuant to which we acquired potential future milestone and other payments, and royalty rights from Bioasis for product candidates that are being developed pursuant to a research collaboration and license agreement between Bioasis and Chiesi. We paid Bioasis $1.2 million upon closing of the Second Bioasis RPA for the purchased rights.
Aronora Royalty Purchase Agreement 
In April 2019, we entered into the Aronora RPA, pursuant to which we acquired the rights to potential royalties and a portion of upfront, milestone, and option payments associated with five anti-thrombotic hematology drug products in development: three candidates subject to Aronora’s collaboration Bayer (the “Bayer Products”) and two additional early-stage candidates (the “non-Bayer Products”).
Under the terms of the Aronora RPA, we made a $6.0 million upfront payment to Aronora when the transaction closed on June 26, 2019, and in September 2019 we made an additional $3.0 million payment for the three Bayer Products that were active as of September 1, 2019. Pursuant to the Aronora RPA, if we receive $250.0 million in cumulative royalties on net sales per product, we will be required to pay associated tiered milestones payments to Aronora in an aggregate amount of up to $85.0 million per product. The tiered milestones will be paid based on various royalty tiers prior to reaching $250.0 million in cumulative royalties on net sales per product. We will retain royalties per product in excess of $250.0 million. We will receive, on average, low single-digit royalties on future sales of the Bayer Products and 10% of all future developmental, regulatory and sales milestones related to the Bayer Products. In addition, we purchased from Aronora the right to receive low single-digit percentage of net sales of the non-Bayer Products and 10% of all future payments, including upfront payments, option payments and developmental, regulatory and sales milestone payments on potential future sales of the non-Bayer Products. In July 2020, Bayer elected to not exercise its option on the third Bayer Product and that product is now subject to the same economics as the non-Bayer Products.
Palobiofarma Royalty Purchase Agreement 
In September 2019, we entered into the Palo RPA, pursuant to which we acquired the rights to potential royalty payments in low single-digit percentages of aggregate net sales associated with six drug candidates in various clinical development stages, targeting the adenosine pathway with potential applications in solid tumors, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ulcerative colitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, psoriasis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and other indications (the “Palo Licensed Products”) that are being developed by Palo. Novartis is a development partner on NIR178, one of the Palo Licensed Products, and NIR178 is being developed pursuant to a license agreement between Palo and Novartis. Under the terms of the Palo RPA, we paid Palo $10.0 million for the rights to potential royalty payments on future sales of the Palo Licensed Products. 
Selected Programs Underlying Our Portfolio
Historically, we have licensed product candidates or provided research and development collaboration services to world-class organizations, such as Novartis and Takeda, in pursuit of new antibody products under which we are eligible to receive potential future milestone payments and royalties. The following is a summary of material license and collaboration agreements that represent a significant component of our portfolio.
Novartis – Anti-TGFβ Antibody (NIS793)
In September 2015, we and Novartis entered into the Anti-TGFβ Antibody License Agreement under which we granted Novartis an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to our anti-TGFβ antibody program (“NIS793”). Novartis is solely responsible for the development and commercialization of the antibodies and products containing the antibodies arising from this program.
Under the Anti-TGFβ Antibody License Agreement, we received a $37.0 million upfront fee, and were eligible to receive up to a total of $480.0 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones. We also are eligible to receive royalties on sales of licensed products, which are tiered based on sales levels and have percentage rates ranging from mid-single-digits to low double-digits. Novartis’ obligation to pay royalties with respect to a particular product and 

10



country will continue for the longer of the date of expiration of the last valid patent claim covering the product in that country, or ten years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product in that country. This program is currently in clinical testing.
In October 2020, we earned a $25.0 million milestone upon the dosing of the first patient in Novartis’ first NIS793 Phase 2 clinical trial. As specified under the terms the Anti-TGFβ Antibody License Agreement, we received $17.7 million in cash and the remaining balance of $7.3 million was recognized as a reduction to our debt obligation to Novartis. 
In July 2021, Novartis announced the FDA had granted Orphan Drug Designation to NIS793 in combination with standard of care chemotherapy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
In October 2021, we earned a $35.0 million milestone payment upon dosing of the first patient in Novartis’ first NIS793 Phase 3 clinical trial. We are eligible to receive remaining milestones up to a total of $410.0 million under the Anti-TGFβ Antibody License Agreement. Upon receipt of regulatory approval to commercialize NIS793, we will receive tiered royalties on net product sales that range from the mid-single-digit to the low double-digits percentage rate. 
Novartis – Anti-IL-1β Antibody (VPM087) 
In August 2017, we and Novartis entered into the Gevokizumab License Agreement, under which we granted Novartis an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to gevokizumab (“VPM087”) (a clinical-stage anti-IL-1b product candidate) and related know-how and patents. Under the terms of the Gevokizumab License Agreement, Novartis is solely responsible for the development and commercialization of VPM087 and products containing such antibody.

Under the Gevokizumab License Agreement, we received total consideration of $30.0 million in 2017 for the license and rights granted to Novartis. Of the total consideration, $15.7 million was paid in cash and $14.3 million (equal to €12.0 million) was paid by Novartis, on our behalf, to settle our loan with Les Laboratories Servier. In addition, Novartis extended the maturity date on our debt to Novartis to September 30, 2022. In June 2021, we repaid its entire outstanding debt balance to Novartis. We also received $5.0 million related to the sale of 539,131 shares of our common stock, at a price per share of $9.2742. Based on the achievement of pre-specified criteria, we are eligible to receive up to $438.0 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones. We also are eligible to receive royalties on sales of licensed products, which are tiered based on sales levels and have percentage rates ranging from mid-single digit to mid-teens. This program is in Phase 1 clinical testing.
Unless terminated earlier, the Gevokizumab License Agreement will remain in effect, on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, until Novartis’ royalty obligations end. The Gevokizumab License Agreement contains customary termination rights relating to material breach by either party. Novartis also has a unilateral right to terminate the Gevokizumab License Agreement on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis or in its entirety with six months’ prior written notice. 
In March 2023, Novartis notified us that based upon a strategic review of the development program, Novartis will not initiate further studies of gevokizumab in gastrointestinal cancers. Novartis’ study to evaluate treatment with gevokizumab with standard of care anti-cancer therapies in patients with metastatic colorectal, gastroesophageal, and renal cancers will continue to primary analysis, which is anticipated later this year.
Novartis – Anti-CD40 Antibody 
In February 2004, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide, multi-product collaboration agreement with Chiron to research, develop and commercialize multiple antibody products for the treatment of cancer, and such agreement was replaced with the Chiron Collaboration Agreement entered in May of 2005. The Chiron Collaboration Agreement was a risk-sharing arrangement whereby Chiron and XOMA shared expenses and revenues on a 70-30 basis, with XOMA’s share being 30%. Financial terms included a loan facility from Chiron to XOMA, secured by XOMA’s 30% ownership interest in the collaboration, of up to $50.0 million to fund up to 75% of our share of expenses beginning in 2005. 

11



In October 2005, Chiron announced it had entered into a definitive merger agreement with Novartis under which Novartis acquired all of the shares of Chiron that it did not already own. This transaction closed in 2006 at which time Novartis acquired Chiron’s interest in the Chiron Collaboration Agreement. In July of 2008, Novartis and XOMA restructured the Chiron Collaboration Agreement, which involved six development programs including iscalimab, a fully human anti-CD40 antagonist antibody intended as a treatment for B-cell mediated diseases, including malignancies and autoimmune diseases. As part of the restructuring, Novartis, the successor to Chiron, was granted, among other things, control over the ongoing product development collaborations remaining thereunder, including iscalimab. In September 2015, the parties agreed to reduce the royalty-style payments that XOMA is eligible to receive on sales of Novartis’ clinical-stage anti-CD40 antibodies (such as iscalimab). These royalty-style payments are tiered based on sales levels and now have percentage rates ranging from mid-single-digit to low teens. 

In September 2021, Novartis announced its decision to discontinue its study of CFZ533 (iscalimab) in kidney transplant. In September 2022, after an interim analysis of data, Novartis also decided to discontinue its study of CFZ533 in liver transplant. Novartis is continuing iscalimab studies in other indications such as Sjögren’s Syndrome, Lupus Nephritis and Hidradenitis Suppurativa.
Our right to royalty-style payments expires on the later of the expiration of any licensed patent covering each product or 10 years from the first commercial sale of each product in each country. 
Takeda
In November 2006, we entered into the Takeda Collaboration Agreement with Takeda under which we agreed to discover and optimize therapeutic antibodies against multiple targets selected by Takeda.
Under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, we may receive additional milestone payments aggregating up to $19.0 million relating to TAK-079 (mezagitamab) and a 4% royalty on future sales of all products subject to this license, including TAK-169, which entered a phase 1 study in February 2020. Our right to milestone payments expires on the later of the receipt of payment from Takeda of the last amount to be paid under the agreement or the cessation by Takeda of all research and development activities with respect to all program antibodies, collaboration targets or collaboration products. Our right to royalties expires on the later of 13.5 years from the first commercial sale of each royalty-bearing discovery product or the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent (or 12 years from first commercial sale if there is significant generic competition post patent-expiration).
In February 2009, we expanded our existing collaboration to provide Takeda with access to multiple antibody technologies, including a suite of research and development technologies and integrated information and data management systems. We may receive milestones of up to $3.3 million per discovery product candidate and low single-digit royalties on future sales of all antibody products subject to this license. Our right to milestone payments expires on the later of the receipt of payment from Takeda of the last amount to be paid under the agreement or the cessation by Takeda of all research and development activities with respect to all program antibodies, collaboration targets or collaboration products. Our right to royalties expires on the later of 10 years from the first commercial sale of such royalty-bearing discovery product or the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent.
In November 2020, the first patient was dosed in Takeda’s Phase 2 study of mezagitamab and we earned a $2.0 million milestone payment from Takeda. We are eligible to receive remaining milestones up to a total of $16.0 million under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement.
In August 2021, Molecular Templates, Inc., assumed full rights to TAK-169 from Takeda, including full control of TAK-169 clinical development, per the terms of its terminated collaboration agreement with Takeda.
In January 2022, we earned a development milestone of $0.8 million pursuant to the Takeda Collaboration Agreement.

12



Rezolute 
In December 2017, we entered into a license agreement with Rezolute pursuant to which we granted an exclusive global license to Rezolute to develop and commercialize X358 (now “RZ358”) products for all indications. We and Rezolute also entered into a common stock purchase agreement pursuant to which Rezolute agreed to issue to us, as consideration for receiving the license for RZ358, a certain number of its common stock related to its future financing activities.
Under the terms of the license agreement, Rezolute is responsible for all development, regulatory, manufacturing and commercialization activities associated with RZ358 and is required to make certain development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments to us of up to $232.0 million in the aggregate based on the achievement of pre-specified criteria. Under the license agreement, we are also eligible to receive royalties ranging from the high single-digits to the mid-teens based upon annual net sales of any commercial product incorporating RZ358. Rezolute’s obligation to pay royalties with respect to a particular RZ358 product and country will continue for the longer of the date of expiration of the last valid patent claim covering the product in that country, or twelve years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product in that country. Rezolute’s future royalty obligations in the United States will be reduced by 20% if the manufacture, use or sale of a licensed product is not covered by a valid XOMA patent claim, until such a claim is issued.
Pursuant to the license agreement, we are eligible to receive a low single-digit royalty on sales of Rezolute’s other non-RZ358 products from its current programs, including RZ402 which is in Phase 1 clinical testing. Rezolute’s obligation to pay royalties with respect to a particular Rezolute product and country will continue for the longer of twelve years from the date of the first commercial sale of the product in that country or for so long as Rezolute or its licensee is selling such product in such country, provided that any such licensee royalty will terminate upon the termination of the licensee’s obligation to make payments to Rezolute based on sales of such product in such country.
The license agreement contains customary termination rights relating to material breach by either party. Rezolute also has a unilateral right to terminate the license agreement in its entirety on ninety days’ notice at any time. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, we have the right to terminate the license agreement if Rezolute challenges the licensed patents.
No consideration was exchanged upon execution of the arrangement. In consideration for receiving the license for RZ358, Rezolute agreed to issue shares of its common stock and pay cash to us upon the occurrence of Rezolute’s financing activities.
The license agreement was subsequently amended in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement as amended, we received a total of $6.0 million upon Rezolute’s achievement of financing activities and $8.5 million in installment payments through October 2020. We also received 161,861 shares of common stock of Rezolute (on an as-adjusted post reverse-split basis). 
In January 2022, Rezolute dosed the last patient in its Phase 2b clinical trial for RZ358, which triggered a $2.0 million milestone payment due to XOMA pursuant to our Rezolute License Agreement.
Janssen 
We and Janssen were parties to a license agreement which was terminated in 2017. In August 2019, we and Janssen entered into a new agreement pursuant to which we granted a non-exclusive license to Janssen to develop and commercialize certain drug candidates under our patents and know-how. Under the new agreement, Janssen made a one-time payment of $2.5 million to us. Additionally, for each drug candidate, we are entitled to receive milestone payments of up to $3.0 million upon Janssen’s achievement of certain clinical development and regulatory approval events. Additional milestones may be due for drug candidates, which are the subject of multiple clinical trials. Upon commercialization, we are eligible to receive a 0.75% royalty on net sales of each product. Janssen’s obligation to pay royalties with respect to a particular product and country will continue until the eighth-year-and-sixth-month anniversary of the first commercial sale of the product in such country. The new agreement will remain in effect unless terminated by mutual written agreement of the parties.

13



In May 2021, we announced we earned a $0.5 million milestone from Janssen, upon dosing of the first patient in a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating one of Janssen’s biologic assets. In December 2021, we earned a $0.2 million milestone pursuant to our agreement with Janssen.
Affimed
In April 2021, we entered into a new agreement with Affimed, under which we are eligible to receive payments from Affimed on potential future commercial sales related to three ICE molecules and pre-loaded natural killer cells containing the ICE molecules. Additionally, we are eligible to receive a milestone upon the first product candidate in each program achieving marketing approval. 
Compugen 
In September 2021, we earned a $0.5 million milestone payment under our license agreement with Compugen triggered by the dosing of the first patient in a Phase 1/2 study of AZD2936, a TIGIT/PD-1 bispecific antibody, in patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. AZD2936 is derived from COM902 and is being developed by AstraZeneca.
In November 2022, we earned a $0.8 million milestone payment under our license agreement with Compugen.
Sonnet Biotherapeutics 
In July 2012, we entered into the Sonnet Collaboration Agreement which was amended in May 2019 to develop various products using Sonnet’s ABD platform. Under the terms of the Sonnet Collaboration Agreement, we may receive milestone payments aggregating up to $3.75 million and low single-digit royalties from Sonnet on future commercial sales of such products. 
In April 2022, Sonnet initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of SON-1010 in adult patients with advanced solid tumors, and we earned a $0.5 million development milestone from Sonnet. 
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to continuous and substantial technological change. Some of the drugs our licensees or milestone and royalty partners are developing may compete with existing therapies or other drugs in development by other companies. Furthermore, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competing products or technologies and may establish collaborative arrangements with our licensees’ or royalty partners’ competitors. There can be no assurance that developments by others, including, without limitation, the development of generics or biosimilars, will not render our licensees’ or royalty partners’ products or technologies obsolete or uncompetitive.
Additionally, our royalty aggregator model faces competition on at least two fronts. First, there are other companies, funds and other investment vehicles seeking to aggregate royalties or provide alternative financing to development-stage biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. These competitive companies, funds and other investment vehicles may have a lower target rate of return, a lower cost of capital or access to greater amounts of capital and thereby may be able to acquire assets that we are also targeting for acquisitions. Second, existing or potential competitors to our partners and licensees’ products, particularly large pharmaceutical companies, may have greater financial, technical and human resources than our licensees. Accordingly, these competitors may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market products. Many of these companies also have extensive experience in preclinical testing and human clinical trials, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products.
For a discussion of the risks associated with competition, see below under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
The research and development, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. We and our partners and licensees, depending on specific activities performed, are subject to these regulations. In the United States, pharmaceuticals are subject to regulation by both federal and various state authorities, including the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act govern the testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products and there are often comparable regulations that apply at the state level. Further, various state and federal healthcare laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act and state and federal data privacy and security law, may also apply. There are similar regulations in other countries as well. For both currently marketed and products in development, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can, among other things, result in delays, the suspension of regulatory approvals, as well as possible civil and criminal sanctions. Development stage products in our portfolio require approval by the FDA before we will recognize any royalties from sales. In addition, changes in existing regulations could have a material adverse effect on us or our partners.
In the United States, the EU and other significant or potentially significant markets for our portfolio and product candidates, government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services. In the United States, the volume of drug pricing-related legislation has dramatically increased in recent years. For example, Congress has enacted laws requiring manufacturers to refund the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, for certain discarded amounts of drugs from single-use vials beginning in 2023 and eliminating the existing cap on Medicaid rebate amounts beginning in 2024. Also, in August 2022 Congress enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other things, requires the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate Medicare prices for certain drugs, imposes an inflation-based rebate on Medicare Part B and D utilization, restructures the Medicare Part D benefit and increases manufacturer contributions in some or all of the Medicare Part D benefit phases. In addition, many state legislatures are considering, or have already passed into law, legislation that seeks to indirectly or directly regulate pharmaceutical drug pricing, such as requiring manufacturers to publicly report proprietary pricing information, creating review boards for prices to state agencies, and encouraging the use of generic drugs. In both the United States and elsewhere, sales of medical products and treatments are dependent, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, such as government and private insurance plans. Further, many countries outside the United States, including the EU member states, have established complex and lengthy procedures to obtain price approvals and coverage reimbursement and periodically review their pricing and reimbursement decisions. If any pricing-related regulation impacts products in our portfolio, it would result in lower royalties received by us.
We believe there are no compliance issues with laws and regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, that have adversely affected, or are reasonably expected to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we currently do not anticipate material capital expenditures arising from environmental regulation. We believe climate change could present risks to our business. Some of the potential impacts of climate change to our business include increased operating costs due to additional regulatory requirements and the risk of disruptions to our business. We do not believe these risks are material to our business at this time.
For a discussion of the risks associated with government regulations, see below under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property is important to our business and our future income streams will depend in part on our partners and licensees’, ability to obtain issued patents and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We hold and have filed applications for a number of patents in the United States and internationally to protect our products and technology. We also have obtained or have the right to obtain licenses to, or income streams based on, certain patents and applications filed by others. However, the patent position of biotechnology companies generally is highly uncertain and consistent policy regarding the breadth of allowed claims has not emerged from the actions of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office with respect to biotechnology patents. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that our, or our partners 

15



or licensees’ patents will afford protection against competitors with similar products or that others will not obtain patents claiming aspects similar to those covered by our, or our partners’ or licensees’ patent applications. Some of our agreements, or those of our partners or licensees, contain “step-down” provisions where the royalty rate is reduced following patent expiration or revocation. Below is a list of representative patents and patent applications related to our licensed programs:

If certain patents issued to others are upheld or if certain patent applications filed by others are issued and upheld, our partners and licensees may require certain licenses from others to develop and commercialize certain potential products incorporating our technology. There can be no assurance that such licenses, if required, will be available on acceptable terms. If such licenses are obtained, our partners and licensees may be able to deduct some or all of the costs from the royalties they owe to us.
We protect our proprietary information, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and partners. These parties may breach these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. To the extent that we or our consultants or partners use intellectual property owned by others, we may have disputes with our consultants or partners or other third parties, as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Concentration of Risk
Our business model is dependent on third parties achieving specified development milestones and product sales. Our portfolio currently includes over 70 fully funded programs from which we could potentially receive royalties or other payments if the programs achieve marketability. Novartis is developing several of the programs in our portfolio. While we do not expect the discontinuation of any one program would have a material impact on our business, the discontinuation of all programs by Novartis could have a material effect on our business and financial condition.

Organization
We were incorporated in Delaware in 1981 and became a Bermuda-exempted company in December 1998. Effective December 31, 2011, we changed our jurisdiction of incorporation from Bermuda to Delaware and changed our name from XOMA Ltd. to XOMA Corporation. When referring to a time or period before December 31, 1998, or after December 31, 2011, the terms “Company” and “XOMA” refer to XOMA Corporation, a Delaware corporation; when referring to a time or period between December 31, 1998, and December 31, 2011, such terms refer to XOMA Ltd., a Bermuda company.
Our principal executive offices are located at 2200 Powell Street, Suite 310, Emeryville, California 94608. Our telephone number at our principal executive offices is (510) 204-7200. Our website address is www.xoma.com. The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report filed with or furnished to the SEC.
Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose risks to our business as clinical trials industry-wide have slowed. Our business is dependent on the continued development and commercialization efforts of our licensees and our royalty agreement counterparties and their licensees. We have been monitoring and continue to monitor our portfolio programs for potential delays in underlying research programs and elections of our partners to continue or cease development. Delays in clinical trials and underlying research programs may lead to delayed revenue from milestones from our licensees and royalty agreement counterparties or, if certain research programs are discontinued, we may recognize impairment charges for our royalty receivables. COVID-19 and the related variants may impact our underlying programs in a variety of ways which are unknown in length and scope at this time.
Employees
We rely on a small number of skilled, experienced, and innovative employees to conduct the operations of our company. As of March 6, 2023, we employed 12 full-time employees and one part-time employee primarily engaged in executive, business development, legal, finance and administrative positions. We also utilize independent contractors and consultants to supplement our workforce. 



Item 1A. Risk Factors
The following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
Risks Related to our Royalty Aggregator Strategy
Our acquisitions of potential future royalty and/or milestone payments may not produce anticipated revenues and/or may be negatively affected by a default or bankruptcy of the licensor(s) or licensee(s) under the applicable license agreement(s) covering such potential royalties and/or milestones, and if such transactions are secured by collateral, we may be, or may become, under-secured by the collateral or such collateral may lose value and we will not be able to recuperate our capital expenditures associated with the acquisition.
We are engaged in a continual review of opportunities to acquire future royalties, milestones and other payments related to drug development and sales as part of our royalty aggregator strategy or to acquire companies that hold royalty assets. Generally, at any time, we seek to have acquisition opportunities in various stages of active review, including, for example, our engagement of consultants and advisors to analyze particular opportunities, technical, financial and other confidential information, submission of indications of interest and involvement as a bidder in competitive auctions. Many potential acquisition targets do not meet our criteria, and for those that do, we may face significant competition for these acquisitions from other royalty buyers and enterprises. Competition for future asset acquisition opportunities in our markets could increase the price we pay for such assets and could reduce the number of potential acquisition targets. The 

18



success of our acquisitions is based on our ability to make accurate assumptions regarding the valuation, probability, timing and amount of potential future royalty and milestone payments as well as the viability of the underlying technology and intellectual property. The failure of any of these acquisitions to produce anticipated revenues may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Some of these acquisitions may expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by or bankruptcy of the licensor(s) or licensee(s) that are parties to the applicable license agreement(s) covering the potential milestone and royalty streams being acquired. In addition, recent volatility in the capital markets may limit our licensees or royalty-agreement counterparties’ ability to access additional funding. While we generally try to structure our receipt of potential milestone and royalty payments to minimize the risk associated with such a default or bankruptcy, there can be no assurance that any such default or bankruptcy will not adversely affect our ability to receive future potential royalty and/or milestone payments. To mitigate this risk, on occasion, we may obtain a security interest as collateral in such royalty, milestone and other payments. Our credit risk in respect of such counterparty may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount we are due pursuant to the terms of the agreements covering the particular assets. This could occur in circumstances where the original collateral was not sufficient to cover a complete loss (e.g., our interests were only partially secured) or may result from the deterioration in value of the collateral, so that, in either such case, we are unable to recuperate our full capital outlay. Any such losses resulting therefrom could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Many of our potential royalty acquisitions may be associated with drug products that are in clinical development and have not yet been commercialized. To the extent that such products are not successfully developed and commercialized, our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted. Acquisitions of potential royalties associated with development stage biopharmaceutical product candidates are subject to a number of uncertainties.
As part of our royalty aggregator strategy, we may continue to purchase future potential milestone and royalty streams associated with drug products which are in clinical development and have not yet received marketing approval by any regulatory authority or been commercialized. There can be no assurance that the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities will approve such products or that such products will be brought to market timely or at all, or that the market will be receptive to such products. To the extent that any such drug products are not successfully developed and subsequently commercialized, the value of our acquired potential milestone and royalty streams will be negatively affected. The ultimate success of our royalty aggregator strategy will depend on our ability to properly identify and acquire high quality products and the ability of the applicable counterparty to innovate, develop and commercialize their products, in increasingly competitive and highly regulated markets. Their inability to do so would negatively affect our ability to receive royalty and/or milestone payments. In addition, we are dependent, to a large extent, on third parties to enforce certain rights for our benefit, such as protection of a patent estate, adequate reporting and other protections, and their failure to do so would presumably negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.
 If the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authority approves a development-stage product candidate that generates our royalty, the labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with the product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, may result in restrictions on the marketing of the product, and could include withdrawal of the product from the market.
In addition, the developers of these development-stage product candidates may not be able to raise additional capital to continue their discovery, development and commercialization activities, which may cause them to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of their clinical trials or research and development programs. If other product developers introduce and market products that are more effective, safer, less invasive or less expensive than the relevant products that generate our royalties, or if such developers introduce their products prior to the competing products underlying our royalties, such products may not achieve commercial success and thereby result in a loss for us. 
Further, the developers of such products may not have sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. If no sales, marketing or distribution arrangements can be made on acceptable terms or at all, the affected product may not be able to be successfully commercialized, which will result in a loss for us. Losses from such assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

19



We intend to continue, and may increase, this strategy of acquiring development-stage product candidates. While we believe that we can readily evaluate and gain conviction about the likelihood of a development-stage product candidate’s approval and achieving significant sales, there can be no assurance that our assumptions will prove correct, that regulatory authorities will approve such development-stage product candidates, that such development-stage product candidates will be brought to market timely or at all, or that such products will achieve commercial success. 
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may continue to, and other actual or threatened epidemics, pandemics, outbreaks, or public health crises may in the future, adversely affect our and our licensees or royalty-agreement counterparties or their licensees, which could cause delays or elimination of our receipts of potential milestones and royalties under our licensing or royalty and milestone acquisition arrangements. 
The global spread of COVID-19 and other actual or threatened epidemics, pandemics, outbreaks, or public health crises has adversely impacted and could materially and adversely impact in the future our licensees or royalty-agreement counterparties or their licensees, which has and could further cause delays, suspensions or cancellations of their drug development efforts including, without limitation, their clinical trials, which would correspondingly delay, suspend or negate the timing of our potential receipts of milestones and royalties under our out-licensing or royalty acquisition agreements. The disruptions to our licensees or RPA counterparties or their licensees could include, without limitation:

● | delays or difficulties in recruiting and enrolling new patients in their clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | delays or difficulties in clinical site initiation;
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, including the diversion of hospitals serving as their clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of their clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site monitoring;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | limitations in employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of their clinical trials, including because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | interruption in global shipping that may affect the transport of clinical trial supplies and materials;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potential refusal by the FDA to accept data, including from clinical trials in affected geographies or failure to comply with updated FDA guidance and expectations related to the conduct of clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | delays in receiving approval from the FDA, the EMA and other U.S. and foreign federal, state and local regulatory authorities to initiate their planned clinical trials or to market their products.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and prospects and the overall economies of the United States and other countries will depend on numerous evolving factors, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the duration and scope of the pandemic and mutations in the COVID-19 virus. 
The evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictive government measures taken in response have had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce, as significant reductions in business related activities have occurred, supply chains have been disrupted, and manufacturing and clinical development activities have been curtailed or suspended. 
In addition, quarantines, stay-at-home, executive and similar government orders, shutdowns or other restrictions on the conduct of business operations continue to impact personnel at third-party clinical testing sites, manufacturing 

20



facilities, and the availability or cost of materials, which could disrupt our licensees’ and RPA counterparties and their licensees’ supply chains.
The spread of COVID-19, which has already resulted in a significant disruption of global financial markets, may materially affect us economically. While the evolving economic impacts brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, it has already significantly disrupted global financial markets, and may limit our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. A recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock.
While several of our partners have experienced delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, clinical trials, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, the effects could continue to have an impact on our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects in future periods.
​
Risks Related to our Industry
Biopharmaceutical products are subject to sales risks. 
Biopharmaceutical product sales may be lower than expected due to a number of reasons, including pricing pressures, insufficient demand, product competition, failure of clinical trials, lack of market acceptance, obsolescence, loss of patent protection, government regulations, the impact of COVID-19 or other factors, and development-stage product candidates may fail to reach the market. Unexpected side effects, safety or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to a product, leading to product recalls, withdrawals, declining sales or litigation. As a result, payments of our future potential milestones and/or royalties may be reduced or cease. In addition, these potential payments may be delayed, causing our near-term financial performance to be weaker than expected. 
Biopharmaceutical products are subject to substantial competition. 
The biopharmaceutical industry is a highly competitive and rapidly evolving industry. The length of any product’s commercial life cannot be predicted with certainty. There can be no assurance that one or more products on which we are entitled to a potential milestone or royalty will not be rendered obsolete or non-competitive by new products or improvements on which we are not entitled to a potential milestone or royalty, either by the current marketer of such products or by another marketer. Current marketers of products may undertake these development efforts in order to improve their products or to avoid paying our royalty. Adverse competition, obsolescence or governmental and regulatory action or healthcare policy changes could significantly affect the revenues, including royalty-related revenues, of the products which generate our potential milestones and royalties. 
Competitive factors affecting the market position and success of each product include:

● | effectiveness;
--+---------------


● | safety and side effect profile;
--+--------------------------------


● | price, including third-party insurance reimbursement policies;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | timing and introduction of the product;
--+----------------------------------------


● | effectiveness of marketing strategy and execution;
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | governmental regulation;
--+-------------------------

21




● | availability of lower-cost generics and/or biosimilars;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | treatment innovations that eliminate or minimize the need for a product; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product liability claims.
--+--------------------------

Biopharmaceutical products that have the potential to generate future milestones and royalties for us may be rendered obsolete or non-competitive by new products, including generics and/or biosimilars, improvements on existing products or governmental or regulatory action. In addition, as biopharmaceutical companies increasingly devote significant resources to innovate next-generation products and therapies using gene editing and new curative modalities, such as cell and gene therapy, products on which we have a milestone or royalty rights may become obsolete. These developments could have a material adverse effect on the sales of the biopharmaceutical products that have potential to generate our milestones and royalties, and consequently could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We depend on our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties for the determination of royalty and milestone payments. While we typically have primary or back-up rights to audit our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties, the independent auditors may have difficulty determining the correct royalty calculation, we may not be able to detect errors and payment calculations may call for retroactive adjustments. We may have to exercise legal remedies, if available, to resolve any disputes resulting from any such audit.
The royalty, milestone and other payments we may receive are dependent on our licensees and royalty agreement counterparties and their licensees’ achievement of regulatory and developmental milestones and product sales. Each licensee’s calculation of the royalty payments is subject to and dependent upon the adequacy and accuracy of its sales and accounting functions, and errors may occur from time to time in the calculations made by a licensee and/or a licensee may fail to report the achievement of royalties or milestones in whole or in part. Our license and royalty agreements typically provide us the primary or back-up right to audit the calculations and sales data for the associated royalty payments; however, such audits may occur many months following our recognition of the royalty revenue, may require us to adjust our royalty revenues in later periods and may require expense on our part. Further, our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties may be uncooperative or have insufficient records, which may complicate and delay the audit process.
Although we intend to regularly exercise our royalty audit rights as necessary and to the extent available, we rely in the first instance on our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties to accurately report the achievement of milestones and royalty sales and calculate and pay applicable milestones and royalties and, upon exercise of such royalty and other audit rights, we rely on licensees’ and royalty-agreement counterparties’ cooperation in performing such audits. In the absence of such cooperation, we may be forced to incur expenses to exercise legal remedies, if available, to enforce our agreements.
The lack of liquidity of our acquisitions of future potential milestones and royalties may adversely affect our business and, if we need to sell any of our acquired assets, we may not be able to do so at a favorable price, if at all. As a result, we may suffer losses.
We generally acquire milestone and royalty rights that have limited secondary resale markets and may be subject to transfer restrictions. The illiquidity of most of our milestone and royalty receivable assets may make it difficult for us to dispose of them at a favorable price if at all and, as a result, we may suffer losses if we are required to dispose of any or all such assets in a forced liquidation or otherwise. In addition, if we liquidate all or a portion of our potential future milestone and/or purchased royalty stream interests quickly or relating to a forced liquidation, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we had previously recorded these interests.
Our royalty aggregator strategy may require that we register with the SEC as an “investment company” in accordance with the Investment Company Act of 1940.
The rules and interpretations of the SEC and the courts, relating to the definition of "investment company" are very complex. While we currently intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be an investment company under 

22



applicable SEC interpretations, we can provide no assurance that the SEC would not take the position that the Company would be required to register under the ‘40 Act and comply with the ‘40 Act’s registration and reporting requirements, capital structure requirements, affiliate transaction restrictions, conflict of interest rules, requirements for disinterested directors, and other substantive provisions. We monitor our assets and income for compliance under the ‘40 Act and seek to conduct our business activities to ensure that we do not fall within its definitions of “investment company” or that we qualify under one of the exemptions or exclusions provided by the ‘40 Act and corresponding SEC regulations. If we were to become an “investment company” and be subject to the restrictions of the ‘40 Act, those restrictions likely would require significant changes in the way we do business and add significant administrative costs and burdens to our operations. To ensure we do not fall within the ‘40 Act, we may need to take various actions which we might otherwise not pursue. These actions may include restructuring the Company and/or modifying our mixture of assets and income or a liquidation of certain of our assets.
Our licensees or royalty-agreement counterparties or their licensees could be subject to natural disasters, public health crises, political crises and other catastrophic events that could hinder or disrupt development efforts.
We depend on our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties and their licensees to successfully develop and commercialize product candidates for which we may receive milestone, royalty and other payments in the future. Our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties and their licensees operate research and development efforts in various locations in the United States and internationally. If any of their facilities is affected by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, power shortages or outages, floods or monsoons, public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, political crises, such as terrorism, war, political instability, labor disputes or strikes, other conflict, or other events outside of their control, their research and development efforts could be disrupted, which could result in the delay or discontinuation of development of one or more of the product candidates in which we have rights to future milestone and/or royalty payments which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects.
Because many of the companies with which we do business also are in the biotechnology sector, the volatility of that sector can affect us indirectly as well as directly.
The same factors that affect us directly also can adversely affect us indirectly by affecting the ability of our partners and others with whom we do business to meet their obligations to us and reduce our ability to realize the value of the consideration provided to us by these other companies in connection with their licensing of our products.
Risks Related to our Financial Results and Capital Requirements
We have sustained losses in the past, and we expect to sustain losses in the foreseeable future. 
We have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception. Although we generated net income of $15.8 million and positive cash flows from operations of $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated net loss of $17.1 million and negative cash flows from operations of $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and we had an accumulated deficit of $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2022. We do not know whether we will ever achieve sustained profitability or whether cash flow from future operations will be sufficient to meet our needs.
To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and debt and royalty interests, and payments received under our collaboration and licensing arrangements. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of our future expenditures and our and our partners’ ability to generate revenues. If our partners’ product candidates are not successfully developed or commercialized, or if revenues are insufficient following regulatory approval, we will not achieve profitability and our business may fail. Our ability to achieve profitability is dependent in large part on the success of our and our partners’ ability to license product candidates, and the success of our partners’ development programs, both of which are uncertain. Our success is also dependent on our partners obtaining regulatory approval to market product candidates which may not materialize or prove to be successful. 

23



Unstable market and global economic conditions may have adverse consequences on our business, financial condition and stock price.
The global credit and financial markets have experienced volatility, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in interest rates, and economic inflation, which has included diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, high inflation, uncertainty about economic stability and changes in unemployment rates. The financial markets and the global economy may also be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, acts of terrorism or other geopolitical events. Sanctions imposed by the United States and other countries in response to such conflicts, including the one in Ukraine, may also continue to adversely impact the financial markets and the global economy, and any economic countermeasures by the affected countries or others could heighten market and economic instability. There can be no assurance that further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions will not occur. Our royalty aggregator strategy may be adversely affected by any such economic downturn, volatile business environment or continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, financial performance and stock price. 
​
Our royalty aggregator strategy may require us to raise additional funds to acquire milestone and royalty interests; we cannot be certain that funds will be available or available at an acceptable cost of capital, and if they are not available, we may be unsuccessful in acquiring milestone and royalty interests to sustain the business in the future.
We may need to commit substantial funds to continue our business, and we may not be able to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms, if at all. If the current equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any additional debt or equity financing more difficult and more costly. Any additional debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us and/or result in dilution to our stockholders, including pursuant to our 2018 Common Stock ATM Agreement, as amended and to our 2021 Series B Preferred Stock ATM Agreement. If we raise additional funds through licensing arrangements with third parties, we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our product candidates, grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us or enter into a license arrangement for a product candidate at an earlier stage of development or for a lesser amount than we might otherwise choose.
If adequate funds are not available on a timely basis, we may:

● | reduce or eliminate royalty aggregation efforts;
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | further reduce our capital or operating expenditures;
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | curtail our spending on protecting our intellectual property; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in the potential royalty acquisition market, including its structure and participants, or a reduction in the growth of the biopharmaceutical industry, could lead to diminished opportunities for us to acquire potential milestones and royalties, fewer potential milestones and royalties (or potential milestones or royalties of significant scale) being available, or increased competition for potential royalties. Even if we continue to acquire potential royalties and they become actual royalties, they may not generate a meaningful return for a period of several years, if at all, due to the price we pay for such royalties or other factors relating to the underlying products. As a result, we may not be able to continue to acquire potential milestones and royalties as we have in the past, or at all.
We have a continuing obligation to pay quarterly dividends to holders of our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, which will be an on-going expenditure for us and may limit our ability to borrow additional funds.
Holders of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when and as declared by our Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 8.625% of the $25.00 liquidation preference per year (equivalent to $2.15625 per year). Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock will 

24



accumulate and be cumulative from, and including, the date of original issue by us of the Series A Preferred Stock. Dividends will be payable in arrears on or about the 15th day of January, April, July and October. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to be paid out of our assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends up to the date of payment (whether or not declared), before any distribution or payment may be made to holders of shares of common stock or any other class or series of our equity stock ranking, as to liquidation rights, junior to the Series A Preferred Stock. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock are redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at redemption prices ranging from $26.00 per share to $25.00 per share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, depending on the date of redemption. 
Holders of depositary shares representing interests in our Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when and as declared by our Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 8.375% of the $25,000 liquidation preference per share of Series B Preferred Stock ($25.00 per depositary share) per year (equivalent to $2,093.75 per year per share or $2.09375 per year per depositary share). Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock will accumulate and be cumulative from, and including, the date of original issue by us of the Series B Preferred Stock. Dividends are payable in arrears on or about the 15th day of January, April, July and October. The shares of Series B Preferred Stock are redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at redemption prices ranging from $26,000.00 per share ($26.00 per depositary share) to $25,000.00 per share ($25.00 per depositary share), plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, depending on the date of redemption. 
The payment of cash dividends and share repurchases is subject to limitations under applicable laws and the discretion of our Board of Directors and is determined after considering current conditions, including earnings, other operating results and capital requirements. Decreases in asset values or increases in liabilities can reduce net earnings and stockholders’ equity. A deficit in stockholders’ equity could limit our ability to pay dividends and make share repurchases under Delaware law. On the other hand, our continued obligation to pay dividends to the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock and depositary shares representing interests in Series B Preferred Stock could restrict us from additional borrowings or make them more costly.
The holders of preferred stock have rights that are senior to those of our common stockholders.
As of December 31, 2022, we had issued and outstanding 984,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends up to the date of payment (whether or not declared). Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, we had issued and outstanding 1,600,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/1000th fractional interest in a share of our Series B Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share of Series B Preferred Stock ($25.00 per depositary share), plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends up to the date of payment (whether or not declared). Our preferred stock is senior to our shares of common stock in right of payment of dividends and other distributions. In the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of our preferred stock must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to our common stockholders.
Information available to us about the biopharmaceutical products underlying the potential royalties we buy may be limited and therefore our ability to analyze each product and its potential future cash flow may be similarly limited. 
We may have limited information concerning the products generating the future potential milestones and royalties we are evaluating for acquisition. Often following our acquisition, the information we have regarding products underlying a potential milestone or royalty may be limited to the information that is available in the public domain. Therefore, there may be material information that relates to such products that we would like to know but do not have and may not be able to obtain. For example, we do not always know the results of studies conducted by sponsors of the products of others or the nature or number of any complaints from doctors or users of such products. In addition, the market data that we obtain independently may also prove to be incomplete or incorrect. Due to these and other factors, the actual potential cash flow from a potential royalty may be significantly lower than our estimates. 

25



Our future income is dependent upon numerous potential milestone and royalty-specific assumptions and, if these assumptions prove not to be accurate, we may not achieve our expected rates of returns.
Our business model is based on multiple-year internal and external forecasts regarding potential product sales and numerous product-specific assumptions in connection with each potential milestone and royalty acquisition, including where we have limited information regarding the product. There can be no assurance that the assumptions underlying our financial models, including those regarding potential product sales or competition, patent expirations or license terminations for the products underlying our portfolio, are accurate. These assumptions involve a significant element of subjective judgment and may be and in the past have been adversely affected by post-acquisition changes in market conditions and other factors affecting the underlying product. Our assumptions regarding the financial stability or operational or marketing capabilities of the partner obligated to pay us potential royalties may also prove to be incorrect. Due to these and other factors, the assets in our current portfolio or future assets may not generate our projected returns or in the time periods we expect. This could negatively impact our results of operation for a given period. 
Reductions or declines in income from potential milestones and royalties, or significant reductions in potential milestone or royalty payments compared to expectations, or impairments in the value of potential milestones and royalties acquired could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation. 
The amount and duration of a royalty usually varies on a country-by-country basis and can be based on a number of factors, such as payments to third party licensors, whether the product is sold singly or in combination, patent expiration dates, regulatory exclusivity, years from first commercial sale of the applicable drug product, the entry of competing generic or biosimilar products, or other terms set out in the contracts governing the royalty. It is common for royalty durations to expire earlier or later than anticipated due to unforeseen positive or negative developments over time, including with respect to the granting of patents and patent term extensions, the invalidation of patents, claims of patent misuse, litigation between the party controlling the patents and third party challengers of the patents, the ability of third parties to design around or circumvent valid patents, the granting of regulatory exclusivity periods or extensions, timing of the arrival of generic or biosimilar competitor products, changes to legal or regulatory regimes affecting intellectual property rights or the regulation of pharmaceutical products, product life cycles, and industry consolidations. If an unexpected reduction in a royalty amount or shortening of a potential royalty term were to occur, it could result in a reduction in potential income from milestones and royalties, a significant reduction in potential milestones and royalty payments compared to expectations, or a permanent impairment of such potential milestones and royalty payments. 
A large percentage of the calculated net present value of our portfolio is represented by a limited number of products. The failure of any one of these products to move forward in clinical development or commercialization may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation. 
Our asset portfolio may not be fully diversified by product, therapeutic area, geographic region or other criteria. Any significant deterioration in the amount or likelihood of receipt of potential cash flows from the top products in our asset portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. For example, in September 2021, Novartis announced its decision to discontinue its study of CFZ533 (iscalimab) in kidney transplant. In September 2022, after an interim analysis of data, Novartis also decided to discontinue its study of CFZ533 in liver transplant. In addition, should the payor of any future potential milestones or royalties decline to pay such potential milestones and royalties for any reason, such failure may result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.

Risks Related to Our Milestone and Royalty Streams
We may not be able to successfully identify and acquire potential milestone and royalty streams on other products, product candidates, or programs, or other companies to grow and diversify our business, and, even if we are able to do so, we may not be able to successfully manage the risks associated with integrating any such products, product candidates, programs or companies into our business or we may otherwise fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions.
To grow and diversify our business, we plan to continue our business development efforts to identify and seek to acquire and/or in-license potential milestone and royalty streams or companies. Future growth through acquisition or in-licensing will depend upon the availability of suitable products, product candidates, programs or companies for acquisition or in-licensing on acceptable prices, terms and conditions. Even if appropriate opportunities are available, we may not be able to acquire rights to them on acceptable terms, or at all. The competition to acquire or in-license rights to promising products, product candidates, programs and companies is fierce, and many of our competitors are large, multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with considerably more financial, development and commercialization resources, personnel, and experience than we have. In order to compete successfully in the current business climate, we may have to pay higher prices for assets than may have been paid historically, which may make it more difficult for us to realize an adequate return on any acquisition.
Even if we are able to successfully identify and acquire or in-license new products, product candidates, programs or companies, we may not be able to successfully manage the risks associated with integrating any products, product candidates, programs or companies into our business or the risks arising from anticipated and unanticipated problems in connection with an acquisition or in-licensing. Further, while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of potential acquisitions through, among other things, due diligence, indemnification and risk allocation, there may be risks and liabilities that such due diligence efforts fail to discover, that are not disclosed to us, or that we inadequately assess. Any failure in identifying and managing these risks and uncertainties effectively would have a material adverse effect on our business. In any event, we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or in-licensing for a variety of reasons, including the possibility that a product candidate fails to advance to clinical development, proves not to be safe or effective in clinical trials, or that a product fails to reach its forecasted commercial potential or that the integration of a product, product candidate, program or company gives rise to unforeseen difficulties and expenditures. Any failure in identifying and managing these risks and uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our business.
 If our potential royalty providers’ therapeutic product candidates do not receive regulatory approval, our potential royalty providers will be unable to market them.
Our potential royalty providers’ product candidates cannot be manufactured and marketed in the United States or any other countries without required regulatory approvals. The U.S. government and governments of other countries extensively regulate many aspects of our partners’ product candidates, including:

● | clinical development and testing;
--+----------------------------------


● | manufacturing;
--+---------------


● | labeling;
--+----------


● | storage;
--+---------


● | record keeping;
--+----------------


● | promotion and marketing; and
--+-----------------------------


● | importing and exporting.

In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act.
Initiation of clinical trials requires approval by health authorities. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA and International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practices and the European Clinical Trials Directive, as applicable, under protocols that detail the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. Other national, foreign and local regulations also may apply. The developer of the drug must provide information relating to the characterization and controls of the product before administration to the patients participating in the clinical trials. This requires developing approved assays of the product to test before administration to the patient and during the conduct of the trial. In addition, developers of pharmaceutical products must provide periodic data regarding clinical trials to the FDA and other health authorities, and these health authorities may issue a clinical hold upon a trial if they do not believe, or cannot confirm, that the trial can be conducted without unreasonable risk to the trial participants.
The results of the preclinical studies and clinical testing, together with chemistry, manufacturing and controls information, are submitted to the FDA and other health authorities in the form of a NDA for a drug, and in the form of a BLA for a biological product, requesting approval to commence commercial sales. In responding to an NDA or BLA, the FDA or foreign health authorities may grant marketing approvals, request additional information or further research, or deny the application if they determine the application does not satisfy regulatory approval criteria. Regulatory approval of an NDA, BLA, or supplement is never guaranteed. The approval process can take several years, is extremely expensive and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the products involved, as well as the target indications. Our potential royalty providers ultimately may not be able to obtain approval in a timely fashion or at all.
The FDA and foreign health authorities have substantial discretion in the drug and biologics approval processes. Despite the time and expense incurred, failure can occur at any stage, and our potential development partners could encounter problems that cause abandonment of clinical trials or cause them to repeat or perform additional preclinical, clinical or manufacturing-related studies.
Changes in the regulatory approval policy during the development period, changes in, or the enactment of additional regulations or statutes, or changes in regulatory review for a submitted product application may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application.
The FDA and other regulatory agencies have substantial discretion in both the product approval process and manufacturing facility approval process, and as a result of this discretion and uncertainties about outcomes of testing, we cannot predict at what point, or whether, the FDA or other regulatory agencies will be satisfied with our licensees’ submissions or whether the FDA or other regulatory agencies will raise questions that may be material and delay or preclude product approval or manufacturing facility approval. In light of this discretion and the complexities of the scientific, medical and regulatory environment, our or our potential royalty providers’ interpretation or understanding of the FDA’s or other regulatory agencies’ requirements, guidelines or expectations may prove incorrect, which also could delay further or increase the cost of the approval process.
Our potential milestone and royalty providers face uncertain results of clinical trials of product candidates.
Drug development has inherent risk, and our potential milestone and royalty providers are required to demonstrate through adequate and well-controlled clinical trials that product candidates are effective, with a favorable benefit-risk profile for use in their target profiles before they can seek regulatory approvals for commercial use. It is possible our potential royalty providers may never receive regulatory approval for any licensed product candidates. Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the resulting product may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community.
Our potential milestone and royalty providers’ product candidates require significant additional research and development, extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials and regulatory approval prior to any commercial sales. This process is lengthy and expensive, often taking a number of years. As clinical results frequently are susceptible to varying 

28



interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals, the length of time necessary to complete clinical trials and to submit an application for marketing approval for a final decision by a regulatory authority varies significantly. As a result, it is uncertain whether:

● | our potential milestone and royalty providers’ future filings will be delayed;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our potential milestone and royalty providers’ preclinical studies will be successful;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our potential milestone and royalty providers will be successful in generating viable product candidates;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we will be successful in finding collaboration and licensing partners to advance our product candidates on our behalf;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our potential milestone and royalty providers will be able to provide necessary data;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | results of future clinical trials by our potential milestone and royalty providers will justify further development; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our potential milestone and royalty providers ultimately will achieve regulatory approval for product candidates in which we have an interest.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The timing of the commencement, continuation and completion of clinical trials by our potential milestone and royalty providers may be subject to significant delays relating to various causes, including failure to complete preclinical testing and earlier-stage clinical trials in a timely manner, inability to engage contract research organizations and other service providers, scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions, changes in key personnel at clinical institutions, difficulties in identifying and enrolling patients who meet trial eligibility criteria and shortages of available drug supply. In addition, since we and our royalty agreement counterparties license our product candidates to others to fund and conduct clinical trials, we, and they, have limited control over how quickly and efficiently such licensees advance those trials. Patient enrollment is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the concentration of patients in specialist centers, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the existence of competing clinical trials and the availability of alternative or new treatments. Regardless of the initial size or relative complexity of a clinical trial, the costs of such trial may be higher than expected due to increases in duration or size of the trial, changes in the protocol under which the trial is being conducted, additional or special requirements of one or more of the healthcare centers where the trial is being conducted, or changes in the regulatory requirements applicable to the trial or in the standards or guidelines for approval of the product candidate being tested or for other unforeseen reasons.
In addition, our potential milestone and royalty providers may conduct clinical trials in foreign countries, which may subject them to further delays and expenses as a result of increased drug shipment costs, additional regulatory requirements and the engagement of foreign clinical research organizations, and may expose our potential milestone and royalty providers to risks associated with foreign currency transactions to make contract payments denominated in the foreign currency where the trial is being conducted.
New products and technologies of other companies may render some or all of our potential milestone and royalty providers’ product candidates noncompetitive or obsolete.
New developments by others may render our potential milestone and royalty providers’ product candidates or technologies obsolete or uncompetitive. Technologies developed and utilized by the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are changing continuously and substantially. Competition in antibody-based technologies is intense and is expected to increase in the future as a number of established biotechnology firms and large chemical and pharmaceutical companies advance in these fields. In addition, as biopharmaceutical companies increasingly devote significant resources to innovate next-generation products and therapies using gene editing and new curative modalities, such as cell and gene therapy, products on which we have a milestone or royalty rights may become obsolete. Many of these competitors may 

29



be able to develop products and processes competitive with or superior to our potential milestone and royalty providers for many reasons, including that they may have:

● | significantly greater financial resources;
--+-------------------------------------------


● | larger research and development staffs;
--+----------------------------------------


● | entered into arrangements with, or acquired, biotechnology companies to enhance their capabilities; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | extensive experience in preclinical testing and human clinical trials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

These factors may enable others to develop products and processes competitive with or superior to our own or those of our potential milestone and royalty providers. In addition, a significant amount of research in biotechnology is being carried out in universities and other non-profit research organizations. These entities are becoming increasingly interested in the commercial value of their work and may become more aggressive in seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements. Furthermore, many companies and universities tend not to announce or disclose important discoveries or development programs until their patent position is secure or, for other reasons, later. As a result, we and our potential milestone and royalty providers may not be able to track development of competitive products, particularly at the early stages.
Positive developments in connection with a potentially competing product may have an adverse impact on our future potential for receiving revenue derived from development milestones and royalties. For example, if another product is perceived to have a competitive advantage, or another product’s failure is perceived to increase the likelihood that our licensed product will fail, our potential milestone and royalty providers may halt development of product candidates in which we have an interest.
Our potential royalty providers may be unable to price our products effectively or obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for sales of our products, which would prevent our potential royalty providers’ products from becoming profitable and negatively affect the royalties we may receive.
If our potential royalty providers succeed in bringing our product candidates to the market, they may not be considered cost effective, and reimbursement to the patient may not be available or may not be sufficient to allow our potential royalty providers to sell the products on a competitive basis. In both the United States and elsewhere, sales of medical products and treatments are dependent, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, such as government and private insurance plans. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which our potential royalty providers may obtain regulatory approval. Even if coverage is available, the associated reimbursement rate may not be adequate for our potential royalty providers to cover related marketing costs. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement policies for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor as there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, the process of obtaining coverage and reimbursement is often time-consuming and costly. Thus, even if our partners’ product candidates are approved by the FDA, our royalty partners may not be able to price the products effectively or obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for their products, which could adversely affect the royalties we receive.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for pharmaceutical products and services. Our business is affected by the efforts of government and third-party payors to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare through various means. In the United States, there have been and will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement government controls on pricing.
In addition, the emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products. We cannot predict whether any legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted or the effect these proposals or managed care efforts may have on our or our potential milestone and royalty providers’ businesses.

30



We do not know whether there will be, or will continue to be, a viable market for the product candidates in which we have an ownership or royalty interest.
Even if product candidates in which we have an interest receive approval in the future, they may not be accepted in the marketplace. In addition, our potential royalty providers may experience difficulties in launching new products, many of which are novel and based on technologies that are unfamiliar to the healthcare community. We have no assurance healthcare providers and patients will accept such products, if developed. Similarly, physicians may not accept a product if they believe other products to be more effective or more cost effective or are more comfortable prescribing other products.
Furthermore, government agencies, as well as private organizations involved in healthcare, from time to time publish guidelines or recommendations to healthcare providers and patients. Such guidelines or recommendations can be very influential and may adversely affect product usage directly (for example, by recommending a decreased dosage of a product in conjunction with a concomitant therapy) or indirectly (for example, by recommending a competitive product over a product in which we have an ownership or royalty interest). Consequently, we do not know if physicians or patients will adopt or use products in which we have an ownership or royalty interest for their approved indications.
Even approved and marketed products are subject to risks relating to changes in the market for such products. Introduction or increased availability of generic or biosimilar versions of products can alter the market acceptance of branded products. In addition, unforeseen safety issues may arise at any time, regardless of the length of time a product has been on the market which may lead to litigation, increased costs and delays or removal of the product from the market.
We are exposed to an increased risk of product liability claims.
The testing, marketing and sales of medical products entails an inherent risk of allegations of product liability. In the event of one or more large, unforeseen awards of damages against us, our product liability insurance may not provide adequate coverage. A significant product liability claim for which we were not adequately covered by insurance or indemnified by a third party would have to be paid from cash or other assets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and the value of our common stock. To the extent we have sufficient insurance coverage, such a claim would presumably result in higher subsequent insurance rates. In addition, product liability claims can have various other ramifications, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, including loss of future sales opportunities, discontinuation of clinical trials, increased costs associated with replacing products, a negative impact on our goodwill and reputation, costs to defend litigation, and divert our management’s attention from our business, each of which could also adversely affect our business and operating results. 
If we and our potential royalty providers are unable to protect our intellectual property, in particular patent protection for principal products, product candidates and processes in which we have an ownership or royalty interest, and prevent the use of the covered subject matter by third parties, our potential royalty providers’ ability to compete in the market will be harmed, and we may not realize our profit potential.
We and our potential royalty providers rely on patent protection, as well as a combination of copyright, trade secret, and trademark laws to protect our proprietary technology and prevent others from duplicating our products or product candidates. However, these means may afford only limited protection and may not:

● | prevent our competitors from duplicating our products and those of our potential royalty providers;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | prevent our competitors from gaining access to our proprietary information and technology and that of our potential royalty providers; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | permit us or our potential royalty providers to gain or maintain a competitive advantage.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because of the length of time and the expense associated with bringing new products to the marketplace, we and our potential royalty providers hold and are in the process of applying for a number of patents in the United States and abroad to protect product candidates and important processes and also have obtained or have the right to obtain exclusive 

31



licenses to certain patents and applications filed by others. However, the mere issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or its enforceability.
The U.S. Federal Courts, the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office or equivalent national courts or patent offices elsewhere may invalidate our patents or find them unenforceable. The America Invents Act introduced post-grant review procedures subjecting U.S. patents to post-grant review procedures similar to European oppositions. U.S. patents owned or licensed by us or our licensees may therefore be subject to post-grant review procedures, as well as other forms of review and re-examination. A decision in such proceedings adverse to our interests could result in the loss of valuable patent rights, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights effectively or to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
If our, and our potential royalty providers intellectual property rights are not protected adequately, our potential royalty providers may not be able to commercialize technologies or products in which we have an ownership or royalty interest, and their competitors could commercialize such technologies or products, which could result in a decrease in our potential royalty providers’ sales and market share that would harm our business and operating results. Specifically, the patent position of biotechnology companies generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. The legal standards governing the validity of biotechnology patents are in transition, and current defenses as to issued biotechnology patents may not be adequate or available in the future. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to:

● | whether any pending or future patent applications held by us or our potential royalty providers will result in an issued patent, or whether issued patents will provide meaningful protection against competitors or competitive technologies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | whether competitors will be able to design around our or our potential royalty providers’ patents or develop and obtain patent protection for technologies, designs or methods that are more effective than those covered by our or our potential royalty providers’ patents and patent applications; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the extent to which our or our potential royalty providers’ product candidates could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, which may lead to costly litigation, result in the payment of substantial damages or royalties, reduce the royalty rate due to us, and prevent our potential royalty providers from using our technology or product candidates.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If certain patents issued to others are upheld or if certain patent applications filed by others are issued and upheld, our potential royalty providers may require licenses from others to develop and commercialize certain potential products in which we have an ownership or royalty interest. These licenses, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms, or may trigger contractual royalty offset clauses in our license agreements, or those of our royalty-agreement counterparties. We may become involved in litigation to determine the proprietary rights of others, and any such litigation will presumably be costly, time consuming, may not be adequately covered by insurance and may have other adverse effects on our business, such as inhibiting our potential royalty providers’ ability to compete in the marketplace and absorbing significant management time.
Due to the uncertainties regarding biotechnology patents, we also have relied and will continue to rely upon trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advancement to develop and maintain our competitive position. Our employees and contractors are typically required to sign confidentiality agreements under which they agree not to use or disclose any of our proprietary information. Research and development contracts and relationships between us and our scientific consultants and potential licensees provide access to aspects of our know-how that are protected generally under confidentiality agreements. These confidentiality agreements may be breached or may not be enforced by a court. To the extent proprietary information is divulged to competitors or to the public generally, such disclosure may adversely affect our licensees’ ability to develop or commercialize our products by giving others a competitive advantage or by undermining our patent position.
In addition, periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and or applications will be due to the U.S. and various foreign patent offices at various points over the lifetime of our and our licensees’ patents and/or applications. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we rely on our 

32



outside patent annuity service to pay these fees when due. Additionally, the U.S. and various foreign patent offices require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with rules applicable to the particular jurisdiction. However, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If such an event were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.
No assurance can be given that our, or our partners or licensees’ patents will be extended upon expiration, which may have an effect on our financial condition and results of operation. 
​
We hold and have filed applications for a number of patents in the United States and internationally to protect our products and technology and have the right to obtain licenses to, or income streams based on, certain patents and applications filed by others. However, the life of a patent, and thus the protection it affords, is limited. Significant patents in our portfolio will expire in the coming years and while various extensions may be available, on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, continuous patent protection is not guaranteed. While we expect to seek, and expect our partners to seek, extensions of patent terms for issued patents where available and when necessary, failure to secure patent extensions may have an effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
Litigation regarding intellectual property and/or the enforcement of our contractual rights against licensees and third parties can be costly and expose us to risks of counterclaims against us.
From time to time, we are required to engage in litigation, arbitration or other proceedings to protect our intellectual property and/or enforce our contractual rights against former or current licensees or third parties, including third-party collaborators of such licensees. The cost to us of complex proceedings of this type, even if resolved in our favor, can be substantial, and the parties opposing us in such proceedings may be able to sustain the cost of such proceedings more effectively than we can if they have substantially greater resources than we have. Any such proceedings and any negotiations leading up to them also may be time-consuming and can divert management’s attention and resources. If a proceeding of this type is resolved against us, we may lose the value associated with contract rights contained in our arrangements with licensees and third parties, the patents that are the subject of such proceeding may be declared invalid, we could be exposed to counterclaims against us, and we could be held liable for significant damages, fees and/or costs. While it is our current plan to continue to review and pursue, on a selective basis, potential material contractual breaches against licensees and third parties (including third-party collaborators of licensees) and/or infringement of our intellectual property rights or technology, there can be no assurance that any such enforcement actions will be successful, or if successful, the timing of such success or that we will have sufficient capital to prosecute any such actions to a successful conclusion.
In June 2021, we initiated an arbitration proceeding against one of our licensees (the “Licensee”) with the American Arbitration Association/International Centre for Dispute Resolution. We believe that the Licensee violated the terms of our License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) and that we are entitled to milestone and royalty payments under the License Agreement, and that the Licensee impermissibly attempted to sublicense our licensed patent rights. We also seek damages and fees and costs of the arbitration (which fees and costs are currently estimated to be in the mid-single-digit millions of U.S. dollars range). In response, the Licensee seeks declarations that the License Agreement, under our interpretation, is unlawful, void and unenforceable, and that the License Agreement has expired. To date, the Licensee has not filed any counterclaims against us. However, to the extent the Licensee is deemed to be the prevailing party, the arbitrators, in their discretion, may require us to pay the Licensee’s fees and costs of the arbitration (currently estimated to be in the mid-single-digit millions of U.S. dollars range). A hearing before a panel of arbitrators was held on this matter in November 2022, and the parties have submitted post-hearing briefs. A decision is expected in the first quarter of 2023.
In addition, we may be subject to claims that we, or our licensees, are infringing other parties’ patents. If such claims are resolved against us, we or our licensees may be enjoined from developing, manufacturing, selling or importing products, processes or services unless we obtain a license from the other party. Such a license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, thus preventing us, or our licensees, from using these products, processes or services and adversely affecting our potential future revenue.

Uncertainties resulting from our participation in litigation, arbitration or other proceedings involving intellectual property and/or contractual rights could have a material adverse effect on our or our partners’ ability to compete in the marketplace. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, the perceived value of the drug product candidates as to which we hold potential milestone or royalty interests, or intellectual property or contractual rights could be diminished. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock may decline. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of litigation, arbitration or other proceedings involving intellectual property and/or contractual rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.
Risks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties
We and our partners rely heavily on license and collaboration relationships, and any disputes or litigation with our partners or termination or breach of any of the related agreements could reduce the financial resources available to us, including our ability to receive milestone payments and future potential royalty and other revenues. License or collaboration agreements relating to products may, in some instances, be unilaterally terminated or disputes may arise which may affect our potential milestones, royalties and other payments.
License or collaboration agreements relating to the products generating our future potential milestones and royalties and other payment rights may be terminated, which may adversely affect sales of such products and therefore the potential payments we may receive. For example, under certain license or collaboration agreements, marketers may retain the right to unilaterally terminate the agreements. When the last patent covering a product expires or is otherwise invalidated in a country, a marketer may be economically motivated to terminate the applicable license or collaboration agreement, either in whole or with respect to such country, in order to terminate its payment and other obligations. In the event of such a termination, a licensor (which may be us in the case of our out-licensed products) or collaborator may no longer receive all of the payments it expected to receive from the applicable licensee or collaborator and may also be unable to find another company to continue developing and commercializing the product on the same or similar terms as those under the license or collaboration agreement that has been terminated. 
In addition, license or collaboration agreements may fail to provide significant protection for the applicable licensor (which may be us in the case of our out-licensed products) or collaborator in case of the applicable licensee’s or collaborator’s failure to perform or in the event of disputes. License and collaboration agreements which relate to the products underlying our potential future milestones, royalties and other payment rights, are complex and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. Disputes may arise regarding intellectual property, royalty terms, payment rights or other contractual terms subject to a license or collaboration agreement, including:

● | the scope or duration of rights granted under the license or collaboration agreement and other interpretative issues;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the amounts or timing of royalties, milestones or other payments due under the license or collaboration agreement;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the sublicensing of patent or other rights under our license or collaboration relationships;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the diligence obligations under the license or collaboration agreement and what activities satisfy such diligence obligations:
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the inventorship and ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by us or our partners; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the priority of invention of patented technology.
--+--------------------------------------------------

The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what the licensor (which may be us in the case of our out-licensed products) or collaborator believes to be the scope of its rights to the relevant 

34



intellectual property or technology, or decrease the licensee’s or collaborator’s financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, any of which could in turn impact the value of our potential royalties, milestones and other payments and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If a marketer were to default on its obligations under a license or collaboration agreement, the licensor’s or collaborator’s remedy may be limited either to terminating certain licenses or collaborations related to certain countries or to generally terminate the license or collaboration agreement with respect to such country. In such cases, we may not have the right to seek to enforce the rights of the licensor or collaborator (if not us) and we may be required to rely on the resources and willingness of the licensor or collaborator (if not us) to enforce its rights against the applicable licensee or collaborator. In any of these situations, if the expected upfront, milestone, royalty or other payments under the license or collaboration agreements do not materialize, this could result in a significant loss to us and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation. At any given time, the Company may be engaged in discussions with its licensees or collaborators regarding the interpretation of the payment and other provisions relating to products as to which we have milestones and potential royalty or other payment rights. Should any such discussions result in a disagreement regarding a particular product that cannot be resolved satisfactorily to us, we may end up being paid less than anticipated on such product should it successfully progress through clinical development and be approved for commercialization. Should our milestone and future potential royalty or other payment interests be reduced or eliminated as a result of any such disagreement, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects. 
Our existing collaborations may not continue or be successful, and we may be unable to enter into future arrangements to develop and commercialize our unpartnered assets. Generally, our current collaborative partners have the right to terminate their collaborations at will or under specified circumstances. If any of our collaborative partners breach or terminate their agreements with us or otherwise fail to conduct their collaborative activities successfully (for example, by not making required payments when due, or at all or failing to engage in commercially reasonable efforts to develop products if required), our product development under these agreements will be delayed or terminated. 
Our potential milestone and royalty providers may rely on third parties to provide services in connection with their product candidate development and manufacturing programs. The inadequate performance by or loss of any of these service providers could affect our potential milestone and royalty providers’ product candidate development.
Third parties provide services in connection with preclinical and clinical development programs, including in vitro and in vivo studies, assay and reagent development, immunohistochemistry, toxicology, pharmacokinetics, clinical trial support, manufacturing and other outsourced activities. If these service providers do not adequately perform the services for which our potential milestone and royalty providers have contracted, or cease to continue operations, and our potential milestone and royalty partners are not able to find a replacement provider quickly or lose information or items associated with their drug product candidates, our potential milestone and royalty providers’ development programs and receipt of any potential resulting income may be delayed.
Agreements with other third parties, many of which are material to our business, expose us to numerous risks and have caused us to incur additional liabilities.
Because our licensees, suppliers and contractors are independent third parties, they may be subject to different risks than we are and have significant discretion in, and different criteria for, determining the efforts and resources they will apply related to their agreements with us. If these licensees, suppliers and contractors do not successfully perform the functions for which they are responsible, we may not have the capabilities, resources or rights to do so on our own.
We do not know whether we or our licensees will successfully develop and market any of the products that are or may become the subject of any of our licensing arrangements. In addition, third-party arrangements such as ours also increase uncertainties in the related decision-making processes and resulting progress under the arrangements, as we and our licensees may reach different conclusions, or support different paths forward, based on the same information, particularly when large amounts of technical data are involved.
In addition, under the contracts with HCRP, the amortization for the reporting period is calculated based on the payments expected to be made by the licensees to HCRP over the term of the arrangement. Any changes to the estimated payments by the licensees to HCRP can result in a material adjustment to revenue previously reported.

35



Failure of our potential milestone and royalty providers’ product candidates to meet current Good Manufacturing Practices standards may cause delays in regulatory approval and penalties for noncompliance.
Our potential milestone and royalty providers may rely on third party manufacturers and such contract manufacturers are required to produce clinical product candidates under cGMP to meet acceptable standards for use in clinical trials and for commercial sale, as applicable. If such standards change, the ability of contract manufacturers to produce our potential milestone and royalty providers’ drug product candidates on the schedule required for clinical trials or to meet commercial requirements may be affected. In addition, contract manufacturers may not perform their obligations under their agreements with our potential milestone and royalty providers or may discontinue their business before the time required by us to successfully produce clinical and commercial supplies of our potential milestone and royalty providers’ product candidates.
Contract manufacturers are subject to pre-approval inspections and periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign authorities to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other applicable government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have control over a third-party manufacturer’s compliance with these regulations and standards. Any difficulties or delays in contractors’ manufacturing and supply of our potential milestone and royalty providers’ product candidates or any failure of our potential milestone and royalty providers’ contractors to maintain compliance with the applicable regulations and standards could increase costs, reduce revenue, make our licensees postpone or cancel clinical trials, prevent or delay regulatory approval by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign authorities, prevent the import and/or export of our potential milestone and royalty providers’ product candidates, or cause any of our potential milestone and royalty providers’ products that may be approved for commercial sale to be recalled or withdrawn.
Certain of our technologies are in-licensed from third parties, so our and our licensees’ use of them may be restricted and subject to additional risks.
We have licensed technologies from third parties. These technologies include phage display technologies licensed to us in connection with our bacterial cell expression technology licensing program and antibody products. However, our and our licensees and collaborators’ use of these technologies is limited by certain contractual provisions in the licenses relating to them, and although we have obtained numerous licenses, intellectual property rights in the area of phage display are particularly complex. If we are unable to maintain our licenses, patents or other intellectual property, we could lose important protections that are material to continuing our operations and for future prospects. Our licensors also may seek to terminate our license, which could cause us and our licensees to lose the right to use the licensed intellectual property and adversely affect our and our licensees’ ability to commercialize our technologies, products or services.
Risks Related to Employees, Location, Data Integrity, and Litigation
The loss of, COVID-19 related absence of, or changes in any of our key personnel, could delay or prevent achieving our objectives.
Our business efforts could be adversely affected by the loss or COVID-19 related absence of one or more key members of our staff. We currently do not have key person insurance on any of our employees. In addition, given our minimal employee base, a COVID-19 outbreak in our employee population could significantly hinder our ability to meet our operating objectives. Changes in management may cause disruption in our business, strategic and employee relationships, which may delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives. During the transition periods, there may be uncertainty among investors, employees and others concerning our future direction and performance. 
Because we are a small biopharmaceutical focused company with limited resources, we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel.
We had 12 full-time employees and one part-time employee as of March 6, 2023. We may require additional experienced executive, accounting, legal, administrative and other personnel from time to time in the future. We are highly dependent on principal members of our executive team, the loss of whose services may adversely impact the achievement of our objectives. There is intense competition for the services of these personnel, especially in California. 

36



Moreover, we expect the high cost of living in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters is located, may impair our ability to attract and retain employees in the future. If we do not succeed in attracting new personnel and retaining and motivating existing personnel, our business may suffer, and we may be unable to implement our current initiatives or grow effectively.
We rely and will continue to rely on outsourcing arrangements for many of our activities, including financial reporting and accounting and human resources. 
Due to our small number of employees, we rely, and expect to continue to rely, on outsourcing arrangements for a significant portion of our activities, including financial reporting and accounting and human resources, as well as for certain of our functions as a public company. We may have limited control over these third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will perform their obligations in an effective and timely manner. 
Our employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading. 
We are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with applicable regulations, provide accurate information to regulatory authorities, comply with federal and state fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, the health care industry is subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions. 
Our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.
Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future licensees, suppliers, contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from cyberattacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. We could experience failures in our information systems and computer servers, which could be the result of a cyberattacks and could result in an interruption of our normal business operations and require substantial expenditure of financial and administrative resources to remedy. System failures, accidents or security breaches can cause interruptions in our operations and can result in a material disruption of our development programs and other business operations. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability.
If our information technology systems or data or those of our partners or contractors are or were compromised by security incidents, our sensitive information could be exposed or stolen and we could experience adverse consequences, including regulatory investigations or actions; litigation; fines and penalties; a disruption of our business operations; reputational harm; loss of revenue or profits; and other adverse business consequences. 
Our business is increasingly dependent on critical, complex and interdependent information technology systems, including cloud-based systems, to support business processes as well as internal and external communications. Our computer systems, and those of our partners and contractors, are potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion and computer viruses that may result in the impairment of key business processes. Such disruptions and breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In the ordinary course of our business, we maintain sensitive data on our networks, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our business partners. The secure maintenance and protection of this information is critical to our business and reputation. Threats to our systems and sensitive data can come from a variety of sources, ranging in sophistication from a person with authorized access to 

37



our network, to an individual hacker, to an organized threat actor organization, to a state-sponsored attack. Cyber threats also may be intentional or accidental. It is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect cyber incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. Data breaches and any unauthorized access to our systems could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. A data security breach could also lead to exposure of personal information of our employees, legacy clinical trial patients, vendors and others, which could expose us to liability under foreign, federal, or state privacy laws. Theft of proprietary information could be used to compete against us and could cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. These incidents could also subject us to liability, expose us to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation and business.
Authorities worldwide have been warning businesses of increased cybersecurity threats from actors seeking to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, failure to maintain effective internal accounting controls related to data security breaches and cybersecurity in general could impact our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny. In addition, these breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above. Moreover, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information, trade secrets or other intellectual property. 
While we have implemented security measures that are intended to protect our data security and information technology systems, such measures may not prevent all such cyber incidents. Further, we cannot be sure that our insurance coverage will be adequate or sufficient to protect us from or to mitigate liabilities arising out of our privacy and security practices, that such coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that such coverage will pay future claims.
Compliance with stringent and changing obligations related to data privacy and security protection is a rigorous and time-intensive process. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with any privacy or data security obligations could lead to regulatory investigations or actions; litigation; fines and penalties; a disruption of our business operations; reputational harm; loss of revenue or profits; loss of customers or sales; and other adverse business consequences.
Many states, countries and jurisdictions strictly regulate data privacy and protection and may impose significant penalties for failure to comply with these requirements. For example, in the U.S., the CCPA became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA establishes a privacy framework for covered businesses, including an expansive definition of personal information and data privacy rights for California residents and the CPRA which became effective on January 1, 2023, which expands upon the CCPA. The CCPA and CPRA give California residents expanded privacy rights, including the right to request correction, access and deletion of their personal information, the right to opt out of certain personal information sharing, and the right to receive detailed information about how their information is processed. The CCPA and CPRA include a framework with potentially severe statutory damages and private rights of action and will likely impact our business activities, along with increasing our compliance costs and potential liability. If we fail to comply with the CCPA and CPRA, we may face significant fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other states are beginning to pass similar laws. 
Compliance with laws and regulations concerning privacy, cybersecurity, data governance and data protection is a rigorous and time-intensive process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the laws and regulations and incur substantial expenditures. If we fail to comply with any such laws or regulations, we may face significant fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, data incidents experienced by us, our partners or collaborators could lead to significant fines, required corrective action, the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, public disclosure of sensitive clinical or commercial data, and the exposure of personally identifiable information (including sensitive personal information) of our employees, partners, and others. A data security breach or privacy violation that leads to disclosure or modification of, or prevents access to, patient information, including personally identifiable information or protected health information, could result in fines, increased costs or loss of revenue as a result of:

● | harm to our reputation;
--+------------------------

38




● | fines imposed on us by regulatory authorities;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | additional compliance obligations under federal, state or foreign laws;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | requirements for mandatory corrective action to be taken by us; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | requirements to verify the correctness of database contents and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect personal data.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition, cyber incidents can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above. Moreover, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches. While we have implemented security measures to protect our data security and information technology systems, such measures may not prevent such events. Lastly, we cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable data protection laws and regulations as they are enforced now or as they evolve. 
Risks Related to Government Regulation
Even after FDA approval, a product may be subject to additional testing or significant marketing restrictions, its approval may be withdrawn, or it may be removed voluntarily from the market.
Even if our potential royalty providers receive regulatory approval for our product candidates, they will be subject to ongoing regulatory oversight and review by the FDA and other regulatory entities. The FDA, the EMA, or another regulatory agency may impose, as a condition of the approval, ongoing requirements for post-approval studies or post-approval obligations, including additional research and development and clinical trials, and the FDA, EMA or other regulatory agency subsequently may withdraw approval based on these additional trials or obligations.
Even for approved products, the FDA, EMA or other regulatory agency may impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses, conditions for use, labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing and production of such product. In addition, the labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and record-keeping for such products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements.
Furthermore, marketing approval of a product may be withdrawn by the FDA, the EMA or another regulatory agency or such product may be withdrawn voluntarily by our potential royalty providers based, for example, on subsequently arising safety concerns. The FDA, EMA and other agencies also may impose various civil or criminal sanctions for failure to comply with regulatory requirements, including withdrawal of product approval.
Healthcare reform measures and other statutory or regulatory changes could adversely affect our business.
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions have enacted or are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our potential royalty providers’ ability to sell products in which we have ownership or and royalty interests, if approved, profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, was enacted, which, among other things, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private payors.
There have been judicial, Congressional and executive branch challenges to the ACA. As a result, there have been delays in the implementation of, and action taken to repeal or replace, certain aspects of the ACA. For example, on June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. In addition, there have been a number of health reform initiatives by the Biden administration that have impacted the ACA. On August 16, 2022, 

39



President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or the IRA, into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and through a newly established manufacturer discount program. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how other such challenges, and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business.
Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 resulted in aggregate reductions in Medicare payments to providers of up to two percent per fiscal year, starting in 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect until 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. In addition, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Such laws, and others that may affect our business that have been recently enacted or may in the future be enacted, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding. 
Also, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently in the U.S. over pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. For example, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these principles. In addition, the IRA, among other things, (i) directs the Secretary of HHS to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D, and subjects drug manufacturers to civil monetary penalties and a potential excise tax by offering a price that is not equal to or less than the negotiated “maximum fair price” under the law, and (ii) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. The IRA permits HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. It is currently unclear how the IRA will be implemented but it is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Further, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. In addition, beginning in 2023, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, will require manufacturers to refund CMS for certain discarded amounts of single-dose container and single-use package drugs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, and restrictions on certain product access. In some cases, such legislation and regulations have been designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
An expansion in the government’s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may cause general downward pressure on the prices of prescription drug products, lower reimbursements for providers, and reduced product utilization, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We expect that additional healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future. We cannot know what form any such new legislation may take or the market’s perception of how such legislation would affect us. Any reduction in reimbursement from government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent our potential royalty providers from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, develop, or commercialize our current product candidates in which we have an ownership or royalty interest. 

40



We and our potential milestone and royalty providers are subject to various state and federal healthcare-related laws and regulations that if violated may impact the commercialization of our product candidates for which we possess milestone or royalty rights or could subject us to significant fines and penalties.
Our operations may be directly or indirectly subject to various state and federal healthcare laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act and state and federal data privacy and security laws. These laws may impact, among other things, the commercial operations for any of our product candidates that may be approved for commercial sale.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the furnishing or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order of a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The ACA modified the federal Anti-Kickback Statute’s intent requirement so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or the specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. 
The federal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws prohibit, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly filing, or causing to be filed, a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government. Certain suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as “qui tam” actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individual, commonly known as a “whistleblower”, or “relator” may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The filing of qui tam actions has caused a number of pharmaceutical, medical device and other healthcare companies to have to defend and/or settle a False Claims Act action. 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including a private payor, or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, health care benefits, items or services. 
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, and its implementing regulations, also imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information by entities subject to the law, such as certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates and their subcontractors that perform certain functions or activities that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information on their behalf. 
Many states also have adopted laws similar to each of the federal laws described above, some of which apply to healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, some states have laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government. Additionally, certain state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources, and require manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers. Further, some states have laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which are not preempted by HIPAA and differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Because of the breadth of these laws, and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our or our potential milestone and royalty providers’ business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.

41



If we or our potential milestone and royalty providers are found to be in violation of any of the laws and regulations described above or other applicable state and federal healthcare laws, we or our potential milestone and royalty providers may be subject to penalties, including significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, reputational harm, exclusion from government healthcare reimbursement programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our or our potential milestone and royalty providers’ operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, we and our licensees may be subject to certain analogous foreign laws and violations of such laws could result in significant penalties.
We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws, as well as export control laws, import and customs laws, trade and economic sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations.
We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws, as well as export control laws, import and customs laws, trade and economic sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations. Our operations are subject to anti-corruption laws including the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. §201, the U.S. Travel Act, and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries where we do business. The FCPA and these other laws generally prohibit us and our employees and intermediaries from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper or prohibited payments, or anything else of value, to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. We and the royalty agreement counterparties and licensees who generate our royalties operate in a number of jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential FCPA violations, and we participate in collaborations and relationships with third parties whose corrupt or illegal activities could potentially subject us to liability under the FCPA or local anti-corruption laws, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. We are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the governments of the United States and authorities in the European Union, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions and embargoes on certain countries and persons, anti-money laundering laws, import and customs requirements and currency exchange regulations, collectively referred to as the Trade Control laws. There is no assurance that we will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA or other legal requirements, including Trade Control laws. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA and other anticorruption laws or Trade Control laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Likewise, any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws by the United States or other authorities could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, our business, financial condition and results of operations. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities or our business arrangements with third parties could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices or the business practices of the royalty agreement counterparties and licensees who generate our royalties may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations or the operations of the royalty agreement counterparties and licensees who generate our royalties are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations, we or the royalty agreement counterparties and licensees who generate our may be subject to significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions, including monetary penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment and exclusion from participation in government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we or the royalty agreement counterparties and licensees who generate our royalties become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, reputational harm, and we or marketers of products that generate our royalties may be required to curtail or restructure operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. The shifting compliance environment and the need 

42



to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements.
As we or our potential milestone and royalty providers do more business internationally, we will be subject to additional political, economic and regulatory uncertainties.
We or our potential milestone and royalty providers may not be able to operate successfully in any foreign market. We believe that because the pharmaceutical industry is global in nature, international activities will be a significant part of future business activities and when and if we or our potential milestone and royalty providers are able to generate income, a substantial portion of that income will be derived from product sales and other activities outside the United States. Foreign regulatory agencies often establish standards different from those in the United States, and an inability to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis could put us at a competitive disadvantage or make it uneconomical to proceed with a product or product candidate’s development. International sales may be limited or disrupted by many factors, including without limitation:

● | imposition of government controls;
--+-----------------------------------


● | export license requirements;
--+-----------------------------


● | political or economic instability;
--+-----------------------------------


● | trade restrictions;
--+--------------------


● | changes in tariffs;
--+--------------------


● | restrictions on repatriating profits;
--+--------------------------------------


● | exchange rate fluctuations; and
--+--------------------------------


● | withholding and other taxation.
--+--------------------------------

General Risk Factors 
Our share price may be volatile, and there may not be an active trading market for our common stock, Series A Preferred Stock or our Series B Preferred Stock.
There can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will not decline below its present market price. Additionally, there may not be an active trading market for our common stock, Series A Preferred Stock or depositary shares representing interests in our Series B Preferred Stock. The market prices of biotechnology companies have been and are likely to continue to be highly volatile. Fluctuations in our operating results and general market conditions for biotechnology stocks could have a significant impact on the volatility of our stock price or the existence of an active trading market for our common stock, Series A Preferred Stock or depositary shares representing interests in our Series B Preferred Stock. We have experienced significant volatility in the price of our common stock. From January 1, 2022, through March 6, 2023, the share price of our common stock has ranged from a high of $32.09 to a low of $15.68. From January 1, 2022, through March 6, 2023, the share price of our Series A Preferred Stock has ranged from a high of $27.09 to a low of $22.14. From January 1, 2022, through March 6, 2023, the share price of our Series B Preferred Stock has ranged from a high of $26.81 to a low of $21.75. Additionally, we have two significant holders of our common stock that could affect the liquidity of our stock and have a significant negative impact on our stock price if the holders were to quickly sell their ownership positions.

Our results of operations and liquidity needs could be materially negatively affected by market fluctuations or an economic downturn.
Our results of operations could be materially negatively affected by economic conditions generally, both in the United States and elsewhere around the world. Concerns over inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, and the U.S. financial markets have in the past contributed to, and may continue in the future contribute to, increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets. Domestic and international equity markets periodically experience heightened volatility and turmoil. These events may have an adverse effect on us. In the event of a market downturn, our results of operations could be adversely affected by those factors in many ways, including making it more difficult for us to raise funds if necessary, and our stock price may decline.

We have issued equity securities and may issue additional equity securities from time to time, that materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock, including our Series X preferred stock, Series A Preferred Stock and depositary shares representing interests in our Series B Preferred Stock.
We expect significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in such a manner as we determine from time to time, including pursuant to our 2018 Common Stock ATM Agreement, as amended, and 2021 Series B Preferred Stock ATM Agreement. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. These sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders. If we issue additional equity securities, the price of our existing securities may be materially and adversely affected.
As of December 31, 2022, there were 5,003 shares of Series X preferred stock issued and outstanding. Each share of Series X preferred stock is convertible into 1,000 shares of registered common stock. The total number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of all issued Series X preferred stock would be 5,003,000 shares. Each share is convertible at the option of the holder at any time, provided that the holder will be prohibited from converting into common stock if, as a result of such conversion, the holder, together with its affiliates, would beneficially own a number of shares above a conversion blocker, which was initially set at 19.99% of our total common stock then issued and outstanding immediately following the conversion of such shares. A holder of Series X preferred shares may elect to increase or decrease the conversion blocker above or below 19.99% on 61 days’ notice, provided the conversion blocker does not exceed the limits under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5635(b), to the extent then applicable. If holders of our Series X convertible preferred stock elect to convert their preferred shares into common stock such conversion would dilute our currently outstanding common stock both in number and in earnings per share. BVF (and its affiliates), as current holders of all shares of our Series X preferred stock, would, if they converted all such shares to common stock, obtain majority voting control of the Company. As of December 31, 2022, BVF owned approximately 31.5% of our total outstanding shares of common stock, and if all of the Series X convertible preferred shares were converted, BVF would own 52.3% of our total outstanding shares of common stock. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, we had issued and outstanding 984,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 1,600,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/1000th fractional interest in a share of our Series B Preferred Stock.
In addition, funding from collaboration partners and others has in the past and may in the future involve issuance by us of our common stock. We cannot be certain how the purchase price of such shares, the relevant market price or premium, if any, will be determined or when such determinations will be made.
Any issuance by us of equity securities, whether through an underwritten public offering, an at the market offering, a private placement, in connection with a collaboration or otherwise could result in dilution in the value of our issued and outstanding shares, and a decrease in the trading price of our securities.

44



We may sell additional equity or debt securities to fund our operations, which may result in dilution to our stockholders and impose restrictions on our business.
In order to raise additional funds to support our operations, we may sell additional equity or convertible debt securities, which would result in dilution to our stockholders and/or debt securities which may impose restrictive covenants that would adversely impact our business. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution or result in other rights or obligations that adversely affect our stockholders. For example, holders of shares of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when and as declared by our Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 8.625% of the $25.00 liquidation preference per year (equivalent to $2.15625 per year). Additionally, holders of depositary shares representing interests in our Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when and as declared by our Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 8.375% of the $25,000 liquidation preference per share of Series B Preferred Stock ($25.00 per depositary share) per year (equivalent to $2,093.75 per year per share or $2.09375 per year per depositary share). The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. 
Our organizational documents contain provisions that may prevent transactions that could be beneficial to our stockholders and may insulate our management from removal.
Our charter and by-laws:

● | require certain procedures to be followed and time periods to be met for any stockholder to propose matters to be considered at annual meetings of stockholders, including nominating directors for election at those meetings; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | authorize our Board of Directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to set the rights, preferences and other designations, including voting rights, of those shares as the Board of Directors may determine.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), that may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding common stock, from merging or combining with us.
These provisions of our organizational documents and the DGCL, alone or in combination with each other, may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of common stock, could limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests, and could make it considerably more difficult for a potential acquirer to replace management.
As a public company in the United States, we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have determined our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting are effective. We can provide no assurance that we will, at all times, in the future be able to report that our disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting are effective.
Companies that file reports with the SEC, including us, are subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the SOX. Section 404 requires management to establish and maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting, and annual reports on Form 10-K filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), must contain a report from management assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Ensuring we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Failure on our part to have effective internal financial and accounting controls would cause our financial reporting to be unreliable, could have a material 

45



adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition, and could cause the trading price of our common stock to fall.
Our ability to use our NOL carry-forwards and certain other tax attributes to offset taxable income or taxes may be limited. 
Our net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards could expire unused and/or be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. As of December 31, 2022, we had U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of $108.8 million, of which $13.6 million will begin to expire in 2036. Under the federal income tax law, federal NOLs incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal NOLs is limited to 80% of current year taxable income. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the federal tax law. In addition, Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (or, the Code), and corresponding provisions of state law, generally limit the ability of a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” to utilize its NOL carry-forwards and certain other tax attributes against any taxable income in taxable periods after the ownership change. An “ownership change” is generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in a corporation’s equity ownership over a three-year period.
Based on an analysis under Section 382 of Code, we experienced an ownership change in February 2017, that significantly limits the availability of our tax attributes to offset future income. To the extent that we do not utilize our carry forwards within the applicable statutory carry-forward periods, either because of Section 382 limitations or the lack of sufficient taxable income, the carry-forwards will also expire unused.
Changes in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition, or results of operations.
​
New tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances could be enacted at any time. For instance, the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act imposes, among other rules, a 15% minimum tax on the book income of certain large corporations and a 1% excise tax on certain corporate stock repurchases. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances could be interpreted differently, changed, repealed, or modified at any time. Any such enactment, interpretation, change, repeal, or modification could adversely affect us, possibly with retroactive effect. In particular, changes in corporate tax rates, the realization of our net deferred tax assets, the taxation of foreign earnings, and the deductibility of expenses under the Tax Act, as amended by the CARES Act or any future tax reform legislation, could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, result in significant one-time charges, and increase our future tax expenses.
Stockholder and private lawsuits, and potential similar or related lawsuits, could result in substantial damages, divert management’s time and attention from our business, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Securities-related class action and stockholder derivative litigation has often been brought against companies, including many biotechnology companies, which experience volatility in the market price of their securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies often experience significant stock price volatility in connection with their product development programs.
It is possible that suits will be filed, or allegations received from stockholders, naming us and/or our officers and directors as defendants. These potential lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties, and the actual defense and disposition costs will depend upon many unknown factors. The outcome of these lawsuits is uncertain. We could be forced to expend significant time and resources in the defense of these suits, and we may not prevail. In addition, we may incur substantial legal fees and costs in connection with these lawsuits. Although we carry insurance to protect us from such claims, our insurance may not provide adequate coverage. It is possible that we could, in the future, incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages. A decision adverse to our interests on these actions could result in the payment of substantial damages, or possibly fines, and could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial position.

46



Monitoring, initiating and defending against legal actions, including any currently pending litigation, are time-consuming for our management, are likely to be expensive and may detract from our ability to fully focus our internal resources on our business activities. The outcome of litigation is always uncertain, and in some cases could include judgments against us that require us to pay damages, enjoin us from certain activities, or otherwise affect our legal or contractual rights, which could have a significant adverse effect on our business. In addition, the inherent uncertainty of any future litigation could lead to increased volatility in our stock price and a decrease in the value of an investment in our common stock.
