Overview
ProMIS has in-licensed a patented technology platform with the potential to deliver a portfolio of antibody therapies, therapeutic vaccines, and other therapies derived from antibodies for neurodegenerative diseases and other misfolded protein diseases, which may include Alzheimer’s disease, multiple system atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration (respectively, AD, MSA, ALS, FTLD, PSP, CBD) and schizophrenia. A common biologic cause contributes to each of these conditions, in that misfolded versions of proteins which normally perform a needed function can cause neuronal degeneration and death when misfolded, contributing to morbidity and mortality. ProMIS’ technology platform is an example of the advances in drug discovery enabled by computational power, in silico discovery, and/or artificial intelligence. We believe this platform provides a potential advantage by selectively targeting the toxic misfolded proteins with therapeutics.
ProMIS’ Platform Technology
ProMIS’ scientific foundation is centered on the growing knowledge base relating to diseases characterized by the presence of abnormal, misfolded proteins. Genetic and experimental research in the neuroscience community has demonstrated that propagating, neurotoxic, misfolded proteins (also referred to as prion-like particles or toxic soluble oligomers) are fundamental drivers of multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, MSA, and ALS. ProMIS’ platform technology allows for the identification of conformational epitopes that become exposed on toxic, misfolded forms of a given protein but are not present on the properly folded form of the same protein. Such disease-specific epitopes (DSEs) can then be used to generate therapeutic antibody candidates that selectively target toxic forms of the protein without interfering with essential functions of the healthy protein. 
​
The ability to model protein misfolding in silico to predict target epitopes restricted to toxic, misfolded forms of a protein was a transformational advance for the development of therapeutic antibodies in terms of speed and quality of the antibodies generated. Earlier methods using less defined immunogens, such as synthetic protein aggregates, relied on chance and extensive screening to identify promising antibody clones, and could never quite achieve strict selectivity for the toxic, misfolded protein. The Company first licensed exclusive rights to ProMISTM target epitope identification technology from the University of British Columbia (UBC) to predict novel DSEs on the molecular surface of misfolded proteins. ProMISTM is an “in silico” rational selection approach that could be applied to any protein where the normal folding structure is at least partially known. The Company subsequently acquired a worldwide license from UBC to “Collective Coordinates,” a computational algorithm employing thermodynamics and statistical mechanics to model protein misfolding. This proprietary computational discovery platform provides a unique and robust engine to predict DSEs on the molecular surface of misfolded proteins. The amino acid sequence of the toxic, misfolded form and the healthy, properly folded form of a target protein are the same but they differ in their conformation. The ProMIS platform offers the ability to identify targets (epitopes) unique to the toxic, misfolded form. Cyclic peptides containing the conformational epitopes are created and used to immunize mice or rabbits to generate selective monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that are designed to attack the disease-causing form of the protein without interfering with the healthy form of the same protein. The mAbs raised in animals are humanized (the critical binding regions are inserted into a human antibody framework) for potential use in patients. We believe the ProMIS approach has the potential to produce more effective and safer antibodies compared to traditional methods of immunization with whole proteins/peptides or aggregates which result in pan-reactive antibodies that cross-react with all forms of a target protein. The lack of selectivity of such antibodies dilutes their efficacy by binding to non-toxic forms of the protein and can potentially interfere with the function of the properly folded protein.
​

We are developing a pipeline of antibodies aimed at selectively targeting misfolded toxic forms of proteins that drive neurodegenerative diseases without interfering with the essential functions of the same properly folded proteins.

Development of a Therapy for the Treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease
AD Overview
AD, a progressive neurodegenerative disease, is the most common type of dementia, accounting for approximately 60 – 80% of all dementia cases. Early symptoms of AD include recent memory loss, as well as apathy and depression. As the disease progresses inexorably, language deterioration, impaired ability to mentally manipulate visual information, poor judgment, confusion, restlessness, and profound mood swings develop. Eventually AD destroys cognition, personality, and the ability to function. The early symptoms of AD, especially at the inaugural stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), are often missed because they are frequently and mistakenly taken for natural signs of ageing. In 2020, reports concluded that 50% of primary care physicians believed the medical profession was not prepared to meet the expected increase in demands the projected rise in AD and dementia cases will create.

8



During 2022, it was estimated there were 6.5 million Americans 65 and older living with AD, and that number is projected to rise to 12.7 million by 2050 (www.alz.org, Alzheimer’s disease Facts and Figures 2022). In the United States, one in three seniors dies of AD or another dementia, which kills more people than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined. AD is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. In 2022, AD and other dementias cost the U.S. $592 billion, and those costs are projected to rise with the increasing number of patients. Approximately 16 million Americans are reported to be unpaid caregivers, who in 2021 provided support for patients valued at $271 billion, to people with AD and other dementias.
Historically, a major challenge in AD has been diagnosis. Twenty years ago, diagnosis of AD could only be confirmed by autopsy. Consensus guidelines have since been developed that established new diagnostic criteria — A/T/N. The methods used are based on sophisticated approaches to brain imaging: amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scans measuring amyloid plaque as a proxy for pathology, tau PET scans measuring tau tangles as a proxy for pathology, and cortical magnetic resonance imaging measuring cortical atrophy as a measure of neurodegeneration. Each of these tests costs thousands of dollars, affordable perhaps to diagnose patients for a clinical trial, but not practical for screening millions of people who might be at risk or have pre-symptomatic AD.
There are now blood-based biomarkers (diagnostic assays) that can provide information that correlates with expensive A/T/N imaging. Plasma levels of p217 tau and p181 tau (tau protein phosphorylated at amino acids 217 and 181 respectively) correlate with brain imaging measures, AD diagnosis, and progression (Mattson et al. JAMA 2023, Jack et al. Brain 2023, Therriant et al. JAMA 2023). These advances have implications for ProMIS’ strategy. Better diagnostics can facilitate more efficient clinical trials, both in terms of identifying potential subjects for the trial and also detecting a potential treatment effect in early, small trials. Secondly, the ability to diagnose disease prior to symptoms raises the possibility of preventive treatment.
According to the World Alzheimer Report 2022, the current dementia market comprises two product categories, namely, AChE inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists. AChE inhibitors dominate the market. The overall market is dominated by four leading brands — Aricept, Namenda, Exelon and Ebixa. Aricept, whose active ingredient is an AChE inhibitor, holds the largest market share. North America was the largest market for AD drugs in 2019, accounting for approximately 35% of total worldwide AD pharmaceutical sales in that year. Two mAbs (Aduhelm, Lequembi) were approved in 2021 and 2022 under FDA’s accelerated approval pathway, which creates a third category of marketed AD treatments, and the first to be considered disease modifying. 
Although there is no scientific consensus on the causation of AD or method of action to treat AD, evidence from some genetic and preclinical studies suggests a causative role for Aβ in the pathogenesis of AD. Published genetic studies support a direct link between increased levels of Aβ and disease susceptibility. Research suggests that genetic mutations in the Aβ precursor protein (APP) and in the presenilin 1 and 2 genes responsible for familial forms of early onset AD all result in increased production of Aβ and Aβ aggregates (Citron et al, 1992; Borchelt et al, 1996). Down Syndrome patients with three copies of the APP gene on chromosome 21 also have elevated levels of APP and Aβ deposits and often develop AD at a premature age (Podlisny et al, 1987). Aβ brain concentration can also increase due to age associated reduction on clearance. Along the same lines, the APOE4 allele, which has been linked to an increased risk of late onset AD, is associated with increased Aβ deposit, while the APOE2 allele, which has been linked to a decreased risk, is associated with decreased Aβ levels (Holtzman et al, 2012). Finally, the only known protective mutation against AD is found in the APP gene and research suggests that this leads to a reduction in the formation of Aβ (Jonsson et al, 2012). In a preclinical study, it was reported that intracerebral injection of Aβ-containing brain extracts from human AD patients into susceptible mice induced cerebral amyloidosis and associated pathology. Depletion of Aβ from the extracts reversed this activity, supporting a link between Aβ and disease induction (Meyer-Luehmann et al, 2006).
While the presence of Aβ plaque is a distinguishing feature of AD, there is a growing body of scientific evidence that the synaptic loss and neurodegenerative spread of AD is primarily mediated by soluble oligomers of misfolded Aβ rather than plaque (Cleary et al, 2004; Jin et al, 2011). Reports from several groups indicate that plaque burden correlates poorly with memory impairment (Cleary et al, 2004; Ferreira et al, 2015) and insoluble Aβ fibrils show little or no demonstrable toxicity in vitro or in vivo (Balducci et al, 2010; Shankar et al, 2008). In contrast, a significant correlation between disease severity and levels of soluble Aβ in the central nervous system was reported by Lue et al (Lue et al, 1999), and the direct neurotoxicity of soluble Aβ oligomers was demonstrated in neuronal cultures in vitro by separate groups (Lauren et al, 

9



2009; Jin et al, 2011). In published reports using rodent models, the injection of soluble oligomeric Aβ, but not soluble monomers or plaque, was shown to induce synaptic damage and cognitive dysfunction (Cleary et al, 2005; Hong et al, 2016).
Figure 1

Synaptotoxicity of Ab oligomers on hippocampal neurons in vitro (Lacor et al, 2007, J Neuroscience)
The mechanism by which soluble oligomeric Aβ generates neuronal damage contributing to AD has been elucidated. A convergence of evidence from multiple studies suggests that the progressive nature of AD arises from the formation and spread of a prion-like subset of misfolded oligomers of Aβ that adopt a β-sheet-rich conformation transmissible to native Aβ in a template-like manner. The self-propagation of these prion-like oligomers follows the stereotypical progression of AD, with initial involvement of the enthorhinal cortex followed by spreading to the hippocampus and neocortex as described by Khan et al (Khan et al, 2014). The prion-like spread of Aβ oligomers has been well-documented in animal models by different groups following the injection of purified oligomers or brain extracts from AD patients or diseased animals (Cleary et al, 2005; Meyer-Luehmann et al, 2006; Watts et al, 2014; Hong et al, 2016). There is also in vitro evidence that such misfolded “Aβ prions” from AD brain can catalyze the misfolding and hyperphosphorylation of tau, another protein involved in the pathogenesis of AD as reported by Jin et al (Jin et al, 2011). Targeting of Aβ oligomers therefore represents an attractive strategy to inhibit progression of the neurodegenerative Aβ-Tau cascade (Choi et al, 2015; Khan et al, 2014).
PMN310
ProMIS’ lead therapeutic program is PMN310, a mAb designed to treat AD by selectively targeting the toxic misfolded form of Aβ. Based on the understanding of Aβ biology described above, PMN310 was designed to be more selective for the toxic oligomer of amyloid than aducanumab, Biogen’s anti-Aβ antibody, lecanemab, currently being co-developed by Eisai Co. and Biogen, and the Prothena PRX012 antibody. These antibodies bind oligomers, but also plaque. This off-target binding of plaque frequently leads to a side effect, ARIA-E and, potentially, limits the benefit of aducanumab and lecanemab by both limiting the highest dose that can be safely administered and by “wasting” a substantial portion of the administered antibody which binds plaque, reducing what is available to neutralize the toxic oligomers.
Recent clinical trial results show that antibodies that bind Aβ monomers (bapineuzumab, solanezumab, crenezumab, gantenerumab) are not efficacious in AD (Salloway et al, 2014, NEJM; Carlson et al, 2016, Alzheimer’s and Dementia; 2Ostrowitzki et al, 2022, JAMA Neurol;3https://www.roche.com/media/releases/med-cor-2022-11-14), suggesting that high selectivity for low abundance toxic AβO is desirable to prevent mAbs from being consumed by unproductive binding to non-pathogenic, abundant monomers (target distraction). Other antibodies with reduced binding to monomers and more selectivity for aggregated Aβ have produced more promising results, including aducanumab and lecanemab, which have both received accelerated approval from the FDA, and donanemab, which showed evidence of a cognitive benefit in Phase 2 trials and is in Phase 3 development. However, treatment with all of these antibodies was associated with the dose-limiting adverse events of ARIA-E (brain edema) and ARIA-H (microhemorrhages) correlated with binding to insoluble deposits of Aβ in the vasculature and plaque. We believe that a selective, oligomer-specific antibody that does not bind monomers or plaque could circumvent these issues and potentially provide an improved product profile with enhanced efficacy. In July 2022, we presented results at the Alzheimers’ Association International Conference (AAIC) of our analysis of the binding response of Aβ-directed antibodies (aducanumab, lecanemab, donanemab, crenezumab, 

10



solanezumab). All antibodies showed some binding signal to toxic AβO from human brain extracts but target distraction by monomers abolished or reduced binding. Only the antibodies that retained measurable binding to oligomers (aducanumab, donanemab and lecanemab) in the face of competition by monomers have shown improvement on cognitive endpoints in previous clinical trials, and that improvement was modest. In our analysis, PMN310 avoided monomer target distraction, with the smallest percent inhibition of binding to brain oligomers when compared to other Aβ-directed antibodies. We believe these data support the therapeutic potential of PMN310.
Development of PMN310 began with using the ProMIS computational platform, which produced in silico six different conformational epitopes as potential targets exposed on toxic misfolded AβO but not Aβ monomers or plaque. The use of AbO-restricted epitopes as the immunogen to generate antibodies is drastically different from the conventional immunization methods used by others. Immunization with Ab peptide or synthetic aggregates used by others to generate Ab-directed antibodies virtually always results in non-selective antibodies that react not only with oligomers but also to varying degrees with monomers and plaque. In contrast, mAbs raised against cyclic peptides containing our predicted AbO conformational epitopes displayed selectivity for Aβ oligomers vs monomers or plaque, and inhibited AβO toxicity and propagation in vitro. The Company designated the PMN310 antibody as its lead candidate for development in AD. As described in our published preclinical studies (Gibbs et. al., 2019, Scientific Reports), PMN310 displayed the desired selective profile with binding to synthetic AβO and little or no binding to Aβ monomers as determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and no detectable binding to plaque or vascular deposits in AD brain sections as determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). In SPR studies with brain extracts from multiple individuals who died of AD, PMN310 also showed binding to fractions containing the toxic AbO species suggesting that PMN310 can recognize an AβO epitope shared across AD brains. In vitro, PMN310 inhibited AβO propagation in a thioflavin-T (ThT) based assay measuring the formation of Aβ aggregates with a beta-sheet structure over time (Gibbs et al, 2019, Scientific Reports). PMN310 also reduced the killing of primary mouse neurons by toxic AβO in culture (Fig.1). In vivo, the activity of murine PMN310 was tested in two different models. In one model conducted at SynAging (Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France), PMN310 and a preparation of toxic AβO were co-delivered (mAb:AβO ratio of 2:1) by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection into male, 3-month old, wild-type C57Bl6/J mouse to determine whether PMN310 might improve cognitive performance and molecular markers in this model of AβO-induced neurotoxicity. Treatment groups consisted of day 0 ICV injection of vehicle alone, AβO alone, vehicle with PMN310 or AβO with PMN310, and contained 12 mice per group to achieve statistical significance. Cognitive performance was assessed on days 7 – 8 using the novel object recognition (NOR) assay. Mice were sacrificed and perfused on day 10, the hippocampus was isolated and levels of synaptic (PSD-95, SNAP25) and inflammation (TNF-α) markers were measured by ELISA in hippocampal homogenates from individual mice. AβO-injected mice failed to recognize a new object and displayed a discrimination index of 0 or less. Co-injection of PMN310 with the toxic oligomers prevented this cognitive deficit. As expected, ICV injection of PMN310 alone had no effect (Fig. 2). The cognitive deficit induced by ICV injection of AβO was associated with inflammation and synaptic damage in the hippocampus, a region important in the development of memory. Hippocampal homogenates from AβO-treated mice displayed an increase in levels of TNF-α and decreases in PSD-95 and SNAP25. Partial protection from these changes was observed in mice co-injected with synthetic AβO and PMN310.

In a second in vivo model conducted at reMYND (Leuven, Belgium), the potential effect of treatment with murine PMN310 (mouse IgG2a) was tested in the transgenic (Tg) hAPP[V717I] mouse model of AD. Characterization of the model indicates that these hAPP-Tg mice display spontaneous, progressive accumulation of Aβ in the brain, eventually resulting in amyloid plaques around 10-11 months of age. In the pre-plaque stage of the pathology, there is a clear cognitive and long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) deficit in these mice suggesting that impairment is caused by soluble toxic species such as AβO rather than plaque. The aim of the study was to assess the impact of seven weekly doses of PMN310 administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) at 30 mg/kg to female mice, beginning at 5.0 months of age. Experimental groups consisted of hAPP-Tg mice treated with vehicle or PMN310, and non-Tg, age-matched littermates treated with vehicle as a control, with 17 mice per group to achieve statistical significance. Spatial learning and memory performance were assessed using the Morris Water Maze task at 6.4 months of age (after seven doses of antibody) which measures the ability of mice to learn and remember the location of a hidden platform in a pool of water. Compared to non-Tg littermates, the hAPP-Tg mice were significantly impaired and showed an increase in both escape latency (time required to find the hidden platform, p=0.0024) and the search path or distance traveled to reach the platform (p=0.0047). Treatment of hAPP-Tg mice with PMN310 significantly improved these outcomes with a decrease in escape latency (p=0.0187) and search path (p=0.0071) (Fig. 3).

PMN310 brain exposure and kinetics after systemic i.p. administration were assessed in mice (Gibbs et. al., 2019, Scientific Reports). In one study conducted by ProMIS, aged 15-17 month old wild type littermates of APP/PS1 mice, received a single 30 mg/kg i.p. injection of humanized PMN310 (n=4), aducanumab (n=3) or PBS as a negative control (n=2). Levels of human IgG present in the plasma and perfused brains were measured 24 h later by ELISA. Equivalent amounts of PMN310 and aducanumab were detected in plasma and brain demonstrating a comparable degree of CNS penetrance (p=0.28) in the range of ~0.3%. As expected, no human IgG was detected in mice injected with PBS alone. Additionally, a study was conducted by ProMIS in aged (13-17 months old) transgenic APP/PS1 mice in order to assess the time course of CNS exposure to PMN310. Plasma and brain levels of human IgG were measured by ELISA on days 1, 7, 14 and 21 after i.p. administration of 30 mg/kg PMN310 (n=4-6 per time point). In spite of declining plasma levels (p=0.0016 for day 1 vs day 7, p<0.0001 for day 1 vs days 14 and 21), CNS levels of PMN310 were detectable out to the study endpoint at day 21, with no significant difference in brain levels at the different time points. These results suggest that PMN310 is comparable to other therapeutic mAbs and is able to cross the blood-brain barrier to reach its target. The Company believes that the greater selectivity of PMN310 for AβO may result in greater neutralization of this disease-causing species (no target distraction) compared with Aβ antibodies derived from immunization with synthetic aggregates. By avoiding plaque binding, PMN310 may also lower the risk of the ARIA adverse events that have been reported associated with plaque-binding antibodies and allow for higher doses to treat the dementia.
The Company has conducted a GLP toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys. PMN310 was administered as a 30-minute IV infusion, on a weekly basis (Days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29), at dose levels of 0, 200, 500, and 1,200 mg/kg/day. Administration of PMN310 was not associated with any adverse effects on clinical observations (local or systemic), body weight, food consumption, ECG, or hematology, coagulation, or urinalysis endpoints. No organ weight effects, macroscopic observations, or microscopic observations were attributed to PMN310 treatment at any doses. PMN310-related changes in clinical chemistry parameters were limited to mildly to moderately increased globulins (1.31x-2.00x) at 1200 mg/kg on Days 2 and 30 likely resulting from circulating PMN310 given one day prior. Based on the results of this study, the PMN310 NOAEL was considered to be 1,200 mg/kg/day in nonhuman primates when administered as a weekly 30-minute IV infusion over four weeks, which is five times higher than the comparable dose in humans that will be used in our Phase 1 trials. 
The Company successfully manufactured PMN310 drug substance under cGMP conditions in partnership with KBI. We plan to file an IND application with FDA within 60 days and further plan to initiate a Phase 1a clinical trial of PMN310 subject to the clearance of an IND application with the FDA. The planned Phase 1a single ascending dose trial in healthy volunteers will test single doses in the range of approximately 2.5 to 60 mg/kg in adults.

Development of a Therapy for the Treatment of Multiple System Atrophy 
MSA Overview
Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare neurodegenerative disease with an estimated prevalence of 3.4 – 4.9 cases per 100,000 population. MSA is characterized by rapidly progressive autonomic failure and motor symptoms with predominant parkinsonian features (MSA-P) or dominant cerebellar features (MSA-C). There is no effective treatment and the mean survival from the onset of symptoms is 6 – 10 years. Histologically, the disease is characterized by alpha-synuclein (a-syn) aggregates in the cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes and, to a lesser extent, in neurons and other glial cells. Published research shows that misfolded toxic a-syn aggregates can trigger the misfolding of normal a-syn into aggregated forms in a prion-like manner. This process can propagate within cells and then spread to other cells that are local or synaptically connected. A-syn aggregates from MSA brain homogenates have been demonstrated to cause MSA-like neurodegeneration in mice. The characteristics of MSA, although devastating for the patients, present several advantages for clinical development: disease progression is rapid allowing for earlier detection of therapeutic potential; high levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL) in serum represent a potential biomarker for inhibition of neuronal damage; and no placebo effects have been observed in clinical trials to date. Even though MSA is a rare disease, recruitment for clinical trials of other candidates has been facilitated by the unmet need and existence of a global MSA Registry (GLOMAR), along with supporting organizations.
Toxic aggregates of misfolded a-syn are also believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Lewy body dementia (DLB). PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons located in the midbrain and the presence of intraneuronal inclusions (Lewy bodies/Lewy neurites) consisting mainly of aggregates of a-syn. Accumulation of insoluble a-syn fibrils in the brain is also observed in LBD. While these insoluble a-syn deposits are characteristic of the disease, recent evidence suggests that a-syn toxicity resides primarily with soluble oligomers and small seeding fibrils (Fusco et al, 2017, Science; Westphal & Chandra, 2013, J Biol Chem). Our candidate antibody against misfolded a-syn could also be directed towards these disorders.
PMN442
Multiple studies indicate that pathogenic aggregates of a-syn can propagate from cell-to-cell in a prion-like manner causing progressive neuronal damage and disease symptoms. Using the ProMIS platform, several conformational epitopes were identified as likely to become exposed on misfolded, pathogenic forms of a-syn (toxic oligomers and soluble seeding fibrils). MAbs were raised against these epitopes and were tested for the desired binding profile and ability to protect neurons against toxic a-syn species in vitro. Traditional methods are unable to generate antibodies with adequate precision to selectively target these neurotoxic forms of a-syn. ProMIS is using its proprietary technology platform for generating and developing antibodies that can uniquely and precisely target these specific toxic forms. As illustrated in figure 4, ProMIS mAbs showed the ability to selectively bind the pathogenic forms of a-syn (toxic oligomers and small soluble fibrils) but not a-syn monomers that play an important functional role in the brain.

Multiple mAbs were screened and PMN442 emerged as the lead candidate and PMN411 as a back-up with the desired characteristics for this program. As measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR), PMN442 showed robust binding to toxic a-syn oligomers and seeding fibrils, with negligible binding to a-syn monomers and physiologic tetramers which are required for normal neuronal function (Figure 5). PMN442 also reacted with native toxic a-syn present in brain homogenates from individuals with MSA and DLB (Figure 6).

The binding response of immobilized PMN442 to a-syn monomers, toxic oligomers, soluble (seeding) preformed fibrils (PFFs) and physiologic (Phys.) tetramers was measured by SPR. The same pattern of binding was observed in 4 independent experiments..

Fig. 6. Binding to native pathogenic a-syn species in patient brain extract. The binding response of immobilized PMN442 to a-syn in brain extract from dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (A) and MSA (B) patients was measured by SPR. A pan a-syn reactive antibody and mouse IgG1 (mIgG1) were used as controls. Results shown are the mean + SEM of two (A) or four (B) independent studies.
In activity assays, PMN442 protected rat dopaminergic neurons against neuronal death by a-syn toxic oligomers (Figure 7). In separate assays, PMN442 also inhibited the processes involved in the cell-to-cell propagation of a-syn aggregates: it reduced the uptake of human a-syn seeding fibrils by neurons and the subsequent formation of intracellular aggregates, as well as the recruitment of endogenous normal a-syn into those aggregates (Figure 8). Taken together, these results 

15



support the potential of PMN442 to selectively target and protect against a-syn pathogenic species in patients with MSA and other synucleinopathies. PMN442 has been humanized in a human IgG1 framework for advancement to IND-enabling studies. In addition to PMN442, ProMIS is evaluating other antibodies that have shown favorable selectivity and in vitro data.

Development of a Therapy for the Treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
ALS Overview
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes muscle weakness, paralysis and, ultimately, respiratory failure leading to death. ALS attacks randomly, and occurs throughout the world with no racial, ethnic or socioeconomic boundaries. It is estimated there are currently 

16



30,000 people in the United States and 450,000 people worldwide, suffering from ALS, with approximately 5,000 new cases arising in the United States annually. Patients with ALS present symptoms such as progressive weakness, muscle atrophy and spasticity. These neurodegenerative and neuromuscular symptoms arise due to the ultimate degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord, the brain stem and in the brain cortex. Incurable and usually fatal within five years, ALS gradually robs a patient of the ability to walk, talk and breathe. Currently, there is no confirmatory test for ALS and many people go undiagnosed at early phases of the disease. Approximately two-thirds of those afflicted by ALS are currently undergoing some form of symptomatic treatment. There are no therapies approved that halt or significantly slow progression.
The biological mechanisms that cause ALS are only partially understood. Misfolded, aggregated TDP-43 forming inside neurons has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS (as well as frontotemporal lobe dementia or FTLD, and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy or LATE) through direct toxicity, loss of function of normal TDP-43, induction of misfolding of other neuronal proteins, and prion-like, cell-to-cell propagation of disease.
Experimentally, misfolded aggregates of TDP-43 are toxic to neural cells, and the prion-like propagation of TDP-43 aggregates has been demonstrated in cell culture and animal models. Importantly, misfolded TDP-43 has been found to induce the misfolding of other proteins into pathogenic aggregates (e.g., SOD1, nuclear pore proteins and transport proteins, DISC1), such that targeting misfolded TDP-43 potentially represents an opportunity to not only neutralize TDP-43 pathology but also interrupt this pathogenic interactome.
PMN267
Using the ProMIS discovery platform, we identified epitopes present on misfolded TDP-43 and generated high affinity antibodies (Fig. 9) that selectively recognized misfolded cytoplasmic aggregates of TDP-43 with no detectable interaction with normal TDP-43. Normal TDP-43 is located in the nucleus and is important for normal cell function (Fig. 10). The antibodies recognized and stained pathogenic TDP-43 aggregates in spinal cord sections from ALS patients and brain sections from FTLD patients (immunohistochemistry) indicating that they have the potential to target disease-causing TDP-43. In vitro data showed that such antibodies can inhibit the cell-to-cell transmission of misfolded TDP-43 in the extracellular space thereby offering the potential to inhibit spreading of pathology (Fig. 11).

Fig. 11. Inhibition of cell-to-cell transmission of misfolded TDP-43 by mAbs. Supernatant from HEK293 cells transfected with misfolding mutant TDP-43 was incubated with test antibodies and added to naïve recipient cells to assess transmission of misfolding TDP-43 (HA-tagged). Compared to a mouse IgG1 negative control (mIgG1), several mAbs inhibited transmission to recipient cells as determined by a reduction in the density of the HA band on a Western blot of recipient cell lysate.
A complementary approach is to target intracellular TDP-43 to reduce toxic gains-of-function within the cell by generating intrabody versions of the TDP-43 antibodies. Intrabodies (from intracellular and antibody) are expressed from within the cell and were designed to target intracellular aggregates of TDP-43. Testing indicated that intrabodies expressed inside HEK293 cells associated selectively with pathogenic aggregates of TDP-43 in the cytoplasm (Fig. 12) and promoted degradation of the aggregates without affecting normal TDP-43 function or harming the cells (Fig. 13).

Staining of HEK293 cells co-transfected with mutant TDP-43 (green) and plasmid encoding a PMN intrabody (red) shows co-localization of the two. There was no interaction of the intrabody with endogenous, normal TDP-43 in the nucleus (nuclei stained blue).
Figure 13

Fig. 13. Clearance of TDP-43 aggregates by intrabody. Transfection of HEK293 cells with a ProMIS intrabody results in degradation of HA-tagged mutant TDP-43 (dNLS) aggregates as measured by reduction in the density of the HA band on a Western blot of cell lysate compared to an empty vector (EV) control.
These results support the potential for using this mAb to selectively target and protect against pathogenic TDP-43. We believe the extracellular antibody could be used to interfere with the cell-to-cell spread of misfolded aggregates of TDP-43 in the extracellular space and slow disease progression, or it could be combined with intrabody constructs delivered inside the cells via viral vectors to degrade intracellular aggregates and prevent further propagation.
The mAbs for TDP-43 generated using the ProMIS platform were tested for selective reactivity with misfolded TDP-43 aggregates and protective activity. Screening of multiple mAbs yielded PMN267 as the lead candidate exhibiting the desired properties. PMN267 bound its target epitope with high affinity in the 10E-11M range. In a cell system, PMN267 showed selective recognition of misfolded, cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates and no detectable interaction with endogenous normal TDP-43 in the nucleus. Similarly, PMN267 did not react with TDP-43 in stress granules, which are important in 

19



protection against oxidative stress. PMN267 also showed binding to exosomes derived from the brains of deceased FTLD individuals. Systemic IP delivery of PMN267 was tested in a transgenic mouse model of ALS/FTLD. In this model, doxycycline-regulated expression of human ΔNLS-TDP-43 is under control of the neurofilament heavy chain promoter such that progression of disease is driven by intracellular expression of aggregating ΔNLS-TDP-43 in all neurons, with little or no contribution of cell-to-cell spread of aggregates. In this aggressive model, a trend for improvement was observed with PMN267 treatment (30 mg/kg/week for 9 weeks) in the majority of motor function read-outs evaluated, including hind limb clasping, hind limb paralysis, grill test of agility, paw coordination, and footfall pattern. We believe the results suggest evidence of protection against motor function deficits by systemic, extracellular delivery of PMN267. 
An intrabody version of PMN267 (single chain antibody sequence encoded into a plasmid) expressed from within cells showed co-localization with cytoplasmic aggregates of TDP-43 and no detectable binding to normal, nuclear TDP-43. Expression of the intrabody promoted degradation of misfolded TDP-43 aggregates in the HEK293 cell system by approximately 58% (Fig. 12). In vitro studies were also performed in collaboration with Dr. Gene Yeo at University of California, San Diego using iPSC-derived motor neurons from ALS patients, the cell type predominantly affected in ALS. In these studies, neurons transduced with vectorized PMN267 intrabody or a control protein (luciferase) were subjected to prolonged stress by puromycin-induced suppression of protein synthesis for 24 hours, giving rise to TDP-43 aggregates that persisted after another 24 hours of recovery. Neurons expressing PMN267 intrabody compared to control protein showed a 30-60% reduction in the amount of stress-induced TDP-43 aggregates as quantitated by high-content imaging. The Company believes that the observed selectivity of PMN267 for misfolded TDP-43 and avoidance of normal TDP-43 has the potential to allow for inhibition of disease without compromising essential TDP-43 function. PMN267 has been humanized in a human IgG1 framework for IND-enabling studies to support the systemic, extracellular administration form. Development of the intrabody form would involve collaboration with a partner with expertise in viral vectorization.
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS
Expansion to Include Other Neurodegenerative and Misfolded Protein Diseases
The ProMIS discovery platform is being applied to other toxic misfolded proteins that drive disease including tau in AD, FTLD, PSP, and CBD, HD, DISC1 in schizophrenia, and RACK1 in ALS in order to potentially generate antibody therapies for these disorders. Under disease conditions, misfolding of each of these proteins leads to the formation of toxic aggregates inside brain cells that can spread damage by propagating from cell-to-cell. Disease-associated conformational epitopes identified through ProMIS’ computational platform are being used to generate potentially therapeutic antibodies. Additionally, we are using the epitopes identified in the amyloid-beta discovery program to generate a vaccine candidate that potentially could be used for prophylactic treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. The Discovery phase of the process comprises two distinct stages: 1) computational modeling to predict and construct conformational peptide epitopes present on the misfolded, toxic form of a protein, followed by either immunization with the peptide epitopes to generate antibodies/ intrabodies, or incorporation of the peptide antigen into a therapeutic vaccine, 2) screening and validation of multiple candidates in vitro and in vivo to select a lead for preclinical development.
Alzheimer’s disease
Tau
Propagation of misfolded, pathogenic aggregates of tau has also been implicated in the progression of AD and other tauopathies such as PSP, CBD, CTE, and FTLD-tau. 
Pan-tau antibodies and relatively non-selective sequence-specific antibodies have failed to show clinical benefit in PSP and AD. The ProMIS platform was used to identify misfolding-specific epitopes and raise mAbs against pathogenic forms of tau (toxic oligomers and small soluble fibrils). A set of mAbs has been generated that preferentially bind pathogenic tau aggregates as opposed to physiologic tau monomers. In binding assays, the ProMIS mAbs recognized toxic species of tau in brain homogenates from individuals with AD (Fig. 14). 
Misfolded tau aggregates can form aggregation seeds that spread through anatomically connected pathways and form toxic fibrillar tau aggregates ultimately leading to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Preclinical data suggest that inhibition 

20



of seeding by misfolded tau can inhibit this spread (Sandusky-Beltran & Sigurdsson Neuropharmacology 2020). In activity assays, the mAbs were able to inhibit the seeding activity of AD brain homogenate resulting in decreased induction of tau aggregation in a cell system. (Fig. 15). These results suggest that these mAbs may be useful in targeting pathogenic tau in AD and potentially other tauopathies. Therefore, the Company believes that selectivity of antibodies for tau pathogenic species that promote formation of toxic aggregates, as opposed to pan-tau reactivity (binding to all forms of tau), is needed both to preserve normal tau function and to minimize the diversion of active antibody from the target through unproductive binding to more abundant non-toxic forms of tau.

Schizophrenia
DISC1 
Protein misfolding and proteostasis defects have been found to play a role in neurodevelopmental diseases, but until recently, the proteins implicated in these disease processes were not known. Just such a protein was first identified in a Scottish family with an autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental syndrome including schizophrenia, and was subsequently named “disrupted in schizophrenia,” or DISC1 (Soares et al. 2011). DISC1 is an important hub protein participating in neurogenesis, mitochondrial transport and dynamics in dendrites, cytoskeletal function, and protein translation in adults, especially at the synapse and under conditions of oxidative stress. DISC1 has been shown to misfold and aggregate in schizophrenia, as indicated by impaired detergent solubility in brains of individuals dying with sporadic (non-genetic) schizophrenia (Leliveld et al. 2008), and the induced co-aggregation of DISC1 by TDP-43 inclusions in human frontotemporal dementia (Endo et al. 2018). In addition, many genetic variants in interactors of DISC1 show significant association with schizophrenia and cognitive decline. Finally, misfolded DISC1 has been shown to exhibit prion-like attributes with transmission from cell-to-cell that can trigger misfolding of healthy DISC1 in the recipient cell (Korth 2012). Thus, DISC1 can be designated a misfolding protein in schizophrenia, just like amyloid and tau are misfolded proteins in AD. We believe application of the ProMIS platform to DISC1 and its interactome offers the potential to generate selective antibodies to selectively degrade toxic misfolded DISC1 while sparing normally folded DISC1 to perform its physiological function. Immunizations have been performed with epitopes predicted by Collective Coordinates to be present specifically on misfolded DISC1 and the resulting mAbs are being characterized. 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
RACK1
RACK1 is a core ribosomal protein of the eukaryotic small (40S) ribosomal subunit. It is a scaffold protein that interacts with several other proteins thereby regulating a variety of signaling pathways critical for cell proliferation, transcription and protein synthesis. It is essential for proper neuronal function. In ALS, our own findings and those of others indicate that misfolded RACK1 co-localizes into cytoplasmic aggregates in motor neurons of the spinal cord which may play a role in disease pathology. For example, in a cell system, we and others have found that mutant TDP-43 suppresses global protein synthesis by co-aggregating with RACK1 on polyribosomes.
To investigate RACK1 as a potential target for ALS, ProMIS explored the impact of RACK1 knock-down (KD) (i.e., what happens in the absence of RACK1). In a cell system, RACK1 was observed to co-aggregate with misfolded mutant TDP-43 in the cytoplasm. Knock-down of RACK1 expression resulted in disaggregation of cytoplasmic TDP-43 and even relocation to the nucleus (normal location) in some of the cells, accompanied by a reversal of the suppression of protein synthesis by mutant TDP-43.
Results from the literature and ProMIS’ proof of concept data using RACK1 KD support intracellular targeting of RACK1 as a potential therapeutic approach for ALS. We are using the ProMIS platform to identify epitopes present on misfolded RACK1 and generate antibodies selective for pathogenic, aggregated RACK1. 
ProMIS has generated five mAbs with the desired selectivity and intrabody versions have been generated for testing. These mAbs recognize diseased tissue (ALS and FTD) but not normal tissue, suggesting that RACK1 is misfolded and aggregated in disease. Research is ongoing to continue to characterize the mAbs and select a candidate.
Alzheimer’s Vaccine Program 
We believe that the same peptide antigens that generate a mAb infusion therapy can be used to create a vaccine. The goal of a therapeutic vaccine is to spur the human immune system to generate antibodies that neutralize toxic oligomers, just as the infusion antibodies will hopefully do. The advantage is that a single course of therapy, usually an initial vaccination followed by a booster, can potentially provide years of therapeutic benefit, eliminating the need for frequent costly infusions. Progress in the reliability of blood-based biomarkers of neurodegeneration will likely increase screening to identify individuals in the early stages of AD or at risk of developing the disease. A vaccine capable of inducing an 

22



effective antibody response against AβO could be administered prophylactically to at-risk individuals to potentially prevent development of symptomatic disease; and the vaccine could also be given therapeutically to individuals living with a diagnosis of AD to potentially inhibit disease progression. Initial results obtained with peptide 301 (the conformational AβO epitope of PMN310) in a vaccine configuration showed robust induction of antibodies selective for AβO with no binding to monomers or plaque. There was also no induction of a potentially deleterious T cell response as observed previously with other Ab vaccines. Optimization of adjuvant formulation and dosing regimen are ongoing. In addition, a multivalent vaccine configuration containing additional AbO-restricted epitopes identified by ProMIS is under evaluation. A multivalent vaccine could potentially boost efficacy by eliciting a broader mix of AbO-specific antibodies, without the complication of a combination product (e.g. cocktail of monoclonal antibodies for infusion). 
In previous studies reported in the literature, a first generation vaccine consisting of aggregated human Aβ protein with QS1 adjuvant induced antibody production in AD patients but elicited meningoencephalitis (brain inflammation) and had to be discontinued for safety reasons. Subsequent studies indicated that T helper (Th) cell epitopes in the Aβ vaccine gave rise to a pro-inflammatory Th1-type response against the same Aβ epitopes in the brain). The Company believes it can avoid this issue with a vaccine candidate consisting of its AβO B cell epitopes (no Aβ Th epitopes) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) as a carrier protein. KLH has been used in humans and provides Th cell epitopes that are needed to help the development of an antibody response by B cells. Since KLH is a foreign protein not present in human brain, immunization is expected to result in an antibody response against AβO without a potentially detrimental Th cell inflammatory response (Fig. 16). This premise is supported by initial preclinical studies that we conducted in collaboration with the University of Saskatchewan’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization-International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac), a global leader in vaccine research and development. The results were presented at the AD/PD conference in 2022.
In these studies, 5-6 week old Balb/c mice (n=6/group) received two intramuscular (IM) injections (days 0 and 28) of a vaccine candidate construct containing ProMIS’ AβO 301 peptide epitope linked to KLH and formulated with different adjuvants. Analysis of serum samples collected on day 0 and after 1 or 2 vaccinations on days 28 and 48 showed induction of a robust antibody response against the AβO epitope as measured by ELISA (Fig. 17). ELISPOT analysis of spleen cells (immune cells) collected from immunized mice at the end of the study on day 48 showed a lack of Th cell cytokine production in response to stimulation with the AβO epitope thereby indicating that the peptide only contains a B cell epitope. As expected, T cell help was provided by the carrier protein and stimulation with KLH gave rise to the production of Th cytokines. These results support the premise that a vaccine consisting of AβO-restricted conformational B cell epitopes conjugated to KLH for T cell help may successfully induce a protective antibody response against AβO without eliciting a potentially inflammatory Aβ-directed Th response. Characterization of immune sera from the mice also showed the desired antibody binding profile: selective binding to AβO compared to Aβ monomers as determined by SPR, and no binding to plaque in brain sections from AD patients as determined by IHC.

Fig. 17. Induction of robust antibody response against AβO epitope. Titers of IgG antibodies against the 301 peptide epitope were measured by ELISA. Values for individual mice at baseline and on days 28 and 48 post-immunization are shown.
Using the ProMIS discovery platform, our aim is to devise a safe and effective vaccine to induce a specific immune response against toxic AβOs. We have identified different peptide epitopes selectively exposed on toxic AβOs that can induce antibodies that selectively bind AβOs. The immediate goal for this program is to progress an amyloid vaccine into preclinical development.

ProMIS’ Technology Platform and Intellectual Property Portfolio
The basis of ProMIS’ proprietary technology platform is the ability to identify small regions of toxic proteins, including their specific shape or “conformation” that are displayed only on the toxic forms of that protein. We have developed patented methods and know-how combining biology and physics, to identify these small regions of proteins which can be the targets for antibodies. When displayed on the toxic protein, these small regions are known as “epitopes.” ProMIS makes copies of these epitopes, in a precisely defined shape. These drug development tools are called peptide antigens and we believe they are the key to our ability to create antibody therapies, vaccines, and diagnostics.
The ProMIS computational platform is based on the Collective Coordinates algorithm that combine physics and biology to simulate the folding, or misfolding of proteins. ProMIS has successfully applied this computational algorithm to several misfolded protein categories, looking for epitopes exposed only on a misfolded toxic form which can be used as an antigen to generate an antibody.
Peptide antigens are the key to creating selective antibodies that target toxic misfolded proteins, like our lead therapeutic antibody candidate (PMN310 for AD). PMN310 was created using a peptide antigen that we correctly predicted to be exposed only on toxic AβOs, not the monomeric or plaque forms of Aβ. ProMIS has generated a portfolio of over 20 peptide antigens that have led to selective antibodies against toxic misfolded forms of Aβ for AD, a-syn for MSA and PD, tau for AD, FTLD, PSP, and CBD, TDP-43 and SOD1 for ALS, RACK1 for ALS and HD, and DISC1 for schizophrenia. Those peptide antigens, and the corresponding selective antibodies, represent proprietary reagents that potentially can be used to create proprietary diagnostic tests in neurodegenerative diseases.
Finally, peptide antigens are also a potential key to making vaccines. Therapeutic vaccines are designed to treat a disease by causing the patient’s immune system to make antibodies (or T-Cells, in some areas like cancer) that neutralize the toxic disease driver. The potential advantage of a therapeutic vaccine, if effective, is that a single course of therapy might provide benefit for many years, not requiring frequent, expensive and inconvenient infusions. In preventive therapy, we believe such an approach may be particularly valuable.
Overview of ProMIS’ Intellectual Property (IP) Portfolio
The ProMIS IP program consists of a three-layered strategy. The first layer of protection comprises two computational algorithms, ProMISTM and Collective Coordinates, obtained under worldwide exclusive license from the UBC. These algorithms are used to predict the specific site and shape (conformation) of epitopes on misfolded proteins implicated in the development of neurodegenerative diseases and on other complex proteins. PCT applications for these disease specific epitopes have been submitted and comprise the second layer of IP protection. Finally, the third layer of protection consists of the composition of matter for the antibodies targeting these disease related epitopes, including use(s) thereof. The second and third layers of this strategy may be in the same patent application.
Prior Joint Venture Agreements with BC Neuroimmunology Lab Inc.
In July 2020, the Company entered into two collaborative agreements with BC Neuroimmunology Lab Inc. (BCNI): the Neurodegen Collaboration and the COVID-19 Collaboration (collectively, the BCNI Collaborations). The Company and BCNI entered into the Neurodegen Collaboration to develop and offer highly accurate and objective tests for detection, diagnosis and monitoring of AD. The Company and BCNI entered into the COVID-19 Collaboration to provide a service of highly sensitive and specific serological assays for the detection and characterization of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that is responsible for COVID-19. Each of the BCNI Collaborations generally provided for an even split among the Company and BCNI with respect to, among other things, funding, capital expenditures, working capital needs or operating losses, ownership, investment decisions, and cash surpluses. The BCNI Collaborations were both terminated in December 2021 and are no longer material to the Company’s business.
The foregoing description of the BCNI Collaborations are qualified in their entirety by reference to the COVID-19 Collaboration and the Neurodegen Collaboration joint venture agreements.

Issued patents from this family are expected to expire August 2024, absent any disclaimers or extensions available. We also own a family of U.S. patents directed to detecting misfolded disease associated proteins. Issued patents from this family are expected to expire August 2024 or June 2025, absent any disclaimers or further extensions available.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In the countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest non-provisional filing date, subject to any disclaimers or extensions. The term of a patent in the United States can be adjusted due to any failure of the U.S. Patent Office (USPTO) following certain statutory deadlines for issuing a patent.
In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for a portion of the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the original expiration of the patent. The protection provided by a patent varies from country to country, and is dependent on the type of patent granted, the scope of the patent claims, and the legal remedies available in a given country.
For a discussion of the risks we face relating to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Intellectual Property — If we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient intellectual property protection for our product candidates, and other proprietary technologies we develop, or if the scope of the intellectual property protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, and other proprietary technologies if approved, may be adversely affected.”

Industry Overview
Markets
ProMIS is applying its in-licensed patented technology platform to build a portfolio of antibody therapies and therapeutic vaccines, for neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, MSA, ALS, FTLD, PSP, CBD, and schizophrenia. A common biologic cause contributes to each of these conditions, in that misfolded versions of proteins which normally perform a needed function can cause neuronal degeneration and death when misfolded, contributing to morbidity and mortality. ProMIS’ technology platform is an example of the advances in drug discovery enabled by computational power, in silico discovery, and artificial intelligence. We believe this platform provides a potential advantage by allowing us to selectively target the toxic misfolded proteins with therapeutics.
Marketing Plans and Milestones
Marketing and commercial launch of any products in the ProMIS portfolio which successfully progress in development must be planned in relation to its available resources. ProMIS intends to out-license the marketing and sales of its products, should they progress successfully in development, to strategic partners for commercialization.
Government Regulations
Regulatory Approval and Certification
All commercial applications of ProMIS’ technology will be subject to substantial regulation and certification in the jurisdictions in which ProMIS or its strategic partners intend to sell its therapeutic products. The initial markets for ProMIS’ product candidates are expected to be the U.S. and Canada and, because the Canadian healthcare marketplace is regulated in a similar manner as in the United States, ProMIS intends to conform its regulatory and certification scheme to the more rigorous standards imposed by the FDA.
Human Therapeutic Products
ProMIS’ human therapeutic product applications will also be subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other approval procedures by the FDA and similar regulatory agencies in other countries. First, preclinical testing of human therapeutics is conducted in nonclinical models and on animals in the laboratory to evaluate the potential efficacy, safety and toxicity of a pharmaceutical product candidate. The results of these studies, along with applicable chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, notifies the applicant of safety concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold. Typically, the clinical evaluation process involves three phases. In Phase 1, clinical trials are conducted with a small number of healthy human subjects, or in a small number of patients to determine the early safety profile, the pattern of therapeutic drug distribution and metabolism. The total number of subjects included in Phase 1 clinical trials varies but is generally in the range of 20 to 80. In Phase 2, clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients who have the disease being evaluated to determine preliminary evidence of efficacy, the optimal dosages, and more extensive evidence of safety. Phase 2 clinical trials are typically controlled and conducted in a limited population, usually involving no more than several hundred subjects. In Phase 3, large scale, statistically-driven multi-center, well- controlled clinical trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the FDA. Phase 3 clinical trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand subjects. In most, though not all, cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to support approval of a drug.
Data from clinical trials conducted outside the U.S. may be accepted by the FDA subject to certain conditions. For example, the clinical trial must be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices (GCP) requirements and/or the FDA must be able to validate the data from the clinical trial through an onsite inspection if it deems such inspection necessary. Where data from foreign clinical trials are intended to serve as the sole basis for marketing approval in the U.S., the FDA will not approve the application on the basis of foreign data alone unless those data are considered applicable to the U.S. patient population and U.S. medical practice, the clinical trials were performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence, 

29



and the data is considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection by the FDA or, if the FDA considers such an inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means.
Marketing Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologics License Application (BLA) requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA or BLA, for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA or BLA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs or BLAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA or BLA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether the drug or biologic is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality, and purity.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug or biologic to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to ensure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
After evaluating the NDA or BLA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA or BLA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s or biologic’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.

Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs or biologics to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval, and the purpose of these programs is to expedite the development and review of new products that are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. While these programs are intended to expedite product development and approval, they do not alter the standards for FDA approval.
A drug may be eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast Track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor interactions with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed. Rolling review means that the agency may review portions of the marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application. In addition, a drug may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate.
A product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for additional FDA programs intended to expedite the review and approval process, including Priority Review designation and Accelerated Approval. A product is eligible for Priority Review designation, once an NDA or BLA is submitted, if the drug that is the subject of the marketing application has the potential to provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. Under priority review, the FDA’s goal date to take action on the marketing application is six months compared to ten months for a standard review. Products are eligible for Accelerated Approval if they are in development for a serious or life-threatening condition and can be shown to have an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
Accelerated Approval is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. The FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or an indication approved under Accelerated Approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product, other evidence demonstrates that the product is not shown to be safe and effective under conditions of use, or required post-approval studies are not conducted with due diligence. Under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 (FDORA), the FDA is now permitted to require, as appropriate, that such trials be underway prior to approval or within a specific time period after the date of approval for a product granted accelerated approval. Under FDORA, the FDA has increased authority for expedited procedures to withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. In addition, the FDA generally requires, unless otherwise informed by the Agency, that all advertising and promotional materials intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days of marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period. After the 120-day period has passed, all advertising and promotional materials must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination or publication.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval do not change the scientific or medical standards for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval, though they may expedite the development or review process.

31



Post-approval Requirements
Drugs or biologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments where such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
In addition, drug and biologic manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval of a drug or biologic is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs or biologics may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off- label uses may be subject to significant liability.
In many foreign countries, drugs and biologics are subject to regulatory requirements in addition to and sometimes different than the U.S. requirements described herein.
Companion Diagnostics
The FDA defines an in vitro companion diagnostic (IVD) device as an in vitro diagnostic device that provides essential information for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product. The use of an IVD companion diagnostic device with a therapeutic product is stipulated in the instructions for use in the labeling of both the diagnostic device and the corresponding therapeutic product, including the label. Applications for an IVD companion diagnostic device and its corresponding therapeutic product will be reviewed and approved according to applicable regulatory requirements. The IVD companion diagnostic device application will be reviewed and approved or cleared under the device authorities of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and relevant medical device regulations; the therapeutic product application will be reviewed and approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act (i.e., drug products) or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (i.e., biological products) and relevant drug and biological product regulations. The FDA intends to review each IVD companion diagnostic device submission within the context of, or in conjunction with, its corresponding therapeutic product, and FDA review of the IVD companion diagnostic device and the therapeutic product will be carried out collaboratively among relevant FDA offices.

32



Ideally, a therapeutic product and its corresponding IVD companion diagnostic device should be developed contemporaneously, with the clinical performance and clinical significance of the IVD companion diagnostic device established using data from the clinical development program of the corresponding therapeutic product. Some of our current and future product development candidates may depend upon co-development of accurate genetic and potentially other IVDs. Thus, we will likely need to comply with both FDA drug and medical device regulations. This adds additional cost and complexity to our development programs. The availability of IVD companion diagnostics can allow more efficient development programs and more appropriate use of products in the marketplace with more predictable outcomes for patients and higher value medicines. Ultimately FDA approval of the IVD will be required to allow approval of some of our products. However, technical difficulties or other issues could delay or disrupt the development of our products.
U.S. Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws and Compliance Requirements
We are subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales and marketing programs for drugs and biologics. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect such operations include:

● | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is a criminal statute which prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. A person does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, imprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act or federal civil monetary penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalty laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval from the federal government, including Medicare, Medicaid and other government payors, that are false or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. federal government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act which prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services that are false or fraudulent;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | HIPAA which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, a person from knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false or fraudulent statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti- Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

33




In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH) and its implementing regulations, impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to CMS, information related to: (i) payments or other “transfers of value” made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and (ii) ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations extend to include transfers of value made during the previous year to certain non-physician providers (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, certified registered nurse anesthetists and anesthesiologist assistants, and certified nurse midwives);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the FCPA which prohibits U.S. businesses and their representatives from offering to pay, paying, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to a foreign official in order to influence any act or decision of the foreign official in his or her official capacity or to secure any other improper advantage in order to obtain or retain business; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations; state laws that require manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, marketing expenditures or drug pricing; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or that otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; and state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including, without limitation, civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participating in federal and state funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, diminished profits and future earnings, reputational harm and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could harm our business.
The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements.
Environmental Regulation
The Company may also be subject to foreign and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. There can be no assurance that the Company will not incur significant costs to comply with laws and regulations in the future or that such laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

34



Pricing and Reimbursement
Precision therapeutic products and their accompanying companion diagnostic are largely paid for based on third party payor reimbursement. In the United States., concurrent with approval for commercialization of such therapeutic products by the FDA, each therapeutic product is assigned a product code, and its associated companion diagnostic assigned a similar code, or CPT. Each product code and CPT is then assigned a reimbursement level by CMS. Third party insurance payors typically establish a specific fee to be paid for each code submitted. Third party payor reimbursement policies are generally determined with reference to the reimbursement for CPT codes for Medicare patients which themselves are determined on a national basis by CMS.
No uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors in the U.S. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. Furthermore, rules and regulations regarding reimbursement change frequently, in some cases on short notice, and we believe that changes in these rules and regulations are likely.
In recent years, Congress has considered reductions in Medicare reimbursement levels for drugs administered by physicians. CMS, the agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, also has authority to revise reimbursement rates and to implement coverage restrictions for some drugs. Cost reduction initiatives and changes in coverage implemented through legislation or regulation could decrease utilization of and reimbursement for any approved products. While Medicare regulations apply only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from federal legislation or regulation may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
The U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have continued implementing cost- containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. In addition, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average sales price and best price. Penalties may apply in some cases when such metrics are not submitted accurately and timely. Increasingly, third-party payors are also requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any products that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, the level of reimbursement.
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Parallel to this regulatory reimbursement scheme in the United States., other countries also regulate reimbursement similarly to the United States. In many countries, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medical products, but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amounts that we are able to charge for our product candidates. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States., the reimbursement for our product candidates may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially-reasonable revenue and profits Therefore, it is important that ProMIS establish for its human diagnostic and therapeutic products reimbursement schemes, which provide ultimate financial payment for ProMIS’ products consistent with its business plan.

35



Healthcare Reform Measures
The United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments also have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government- paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs.
The Affordable Care Act substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act is intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum Medicaid rebate for both branded and generic drugs, expanded the 340B program, and revised the definition of average manufacturer price (AMP), which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates manufacturers are required to pay to states. The legislation also extended Medicaid drug rebates, previously due only on fee-for- service Medicaid utilization, to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well and created an alternative rebate formula for certain new formulations of certain existing products that is intended to increase the number of rebates due on those drugs. On February 1, 2016, CMS issued final regulations to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program under the Affordable Care Act. These regulations became effective on April 1, 2016. Since that time, there have been significant ongoing efforts to modify or eliminate the Affordable Care Act.
The Affordable Care Act has been subject to challenges in the courts. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and remanded the case to the Texas District Court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the entire Affordable Care Act. An appeal was taken to the U.S. Supreme Court. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the law as they had not alleged personal injury traceable to the allegedly unlawful conduct. As a result, the U.S. Supreme Court did not rule on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act or any of its provisions.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since passage of the Affordable Care Act.

● | The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of an amount greater than $1.2 trillion for the fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to healthcare providers of up to 2.0% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional action is taken by Congress. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 retained the federal budget “sequestration” Medicare payment reductions of 2%, and extended it through 2027 unless congressional action is taken, and also increased labeler responsibility for prescription costs in the Medicare Part D coverage gap. Pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act, as well as subsequent legislation, these reductions have been suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the suspension, a 1% payment reduction began April 1, 2022, lasting through June 30, 2022. The 2% payment reduction resumed on July 1, 2022.

● | On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.

● | On December 20, 2019, former President Trump signed into law the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1865), which repealed the Cadillac tax, the health insurance provider tax, and the medical device excise tax. It is impossible to determine whether similar taxes could be instated in the future.

● | In August 2022, the United States Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or the IRA, was signed into law. The IRA contains substantial drug pricing reforms, including the establishment of a drug price negotiation program within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that would require manufacturers to charge a negotiated “maximum fair price” for certain selected drugs or pay an excise tax for noncompliance, the establishment of rebate payment requirements on manufacturers of certain drugs payable under Medicare Parts B and D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation, and requires manufacturers to provide discounts on Part D drugs. Substantial penalties can be assessed for noncompliance with the drug pricing provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The IRA could have the effect of reducing the prices we can charge and reimbursement we receive for our products, if approved, thereby reducing our profitability, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. The effect the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry in general is not yet known.

Further legislative and regulatory changes under the Affordable Care Act remain possible, although the Biden Administration has signaled that it plans to build on the Affordable Care Act and expand the number of people who are eligible for subsidies under it. President Biden indicated that he intends to use executive orders to undo changes to the Affordable Care Act made by the Trump administration and would advocate for legislation to build on the Affordable Care Act. It is unknown what form any such changes or any law would take, and how or whether it may affect our business in the future. We expect that changes or additions to the Affordable Care Act, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, allowing the federal government to directly negotiate drug prices and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry.
Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain drug access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce the ultimate demand for our drugs or put pressure on our drug pricing, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
We expect that additional federal, state and foreign healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in limited coverage and reimbursement and reduced demand for our products, if approved, or additional pricing pressures.

Regulation Outside of the United States
In addition to regulations in the United States, we may be subject to a variety of regulations in foreign jurisdictions that govern, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products, if approved, either directly or through our distribution partners. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing and sale of the product in those countries. The foreign regulatory approval process and the time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Some foreign jurisdictions have a drug product approval process similar to that in the U.S., which requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of clinical studies. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. Moreover, some nations may not accept clinical studies performed for U.S. approval to support approval in their countries or require that additional studies be performed on natives of their countries. In addition, in certain foreign markets, the pricing of drug products is subject to government control and reimbursement may in some cases be unavailable or insufficient. We face the risk that the resulting prices would be insufficient to generate an acceptable return to us or any future partner of ours. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecution.
Commercial Marketing Plans and Strategies
ProMIS currently does not intend to market its therapeutic products or any companion diagnostics it develops that require extensive distribution channels. Instead, ProMIS expects to license to, or enter into strategic alliances with, pharmaceutical entities that are equipped to manufacture and/or market ProMIS’ products through their distribution networks. ProMIS may license some or all of its patent rights to more than one company to achieve the fullest development, marketing and distribution of its products. To this end, ProMIS intends to continue to develop and improve its proprietary technologies and to expand the applications of its technologies in the healthcare markets.
Generate Product Revenues
Revenues, if any, from its precision therapeutics pipeline and companion diagnostics are expected to be generated from research funding, license fees, milestone payments, co-development funding, and royalties from partnerships to be completed by ProMIS with selected third-party, multi-national health care firms. As of the date of this form, ProMIS has not generated any significant product revenues.
Develop Collaborative Customer-Funded Commercialization Agreements
In order to increase market exposure of its products and to capitalize on a partner’s clinical development competencies, market position, and distribution capabilities, ProMIS intends to develop its projects with collaborative commercial partners who will fund further product development projects incorporating ProMIS’ technology. These collaborative arrangements typically will provide for a jointly funded development project and contemplate a licensing arrangement (which may be entered into at the same time as the development project or at a later date) under which, if a project is commercialized by the collaborative partner, ProMIS would potentially receive license fees, royalty payments from product sales and manufacturing revenue. ProMIS believes that such arrangements with major commercial partners will serve to validate its proprietary technologies in human healthcare areas and thereby assist ProMIS in attracting additional licensing arrangements on favorable terms.
Enhance Out-licensing of ProMIS Requirements
Where practical, ProMIS will outsource its product manufacturing and has explored and will continue to evaluate the possibility of entering into strategic manufacturing alliances with appropriate third parties.

Competition
Human Healthcare Products Competition
ProMIS will compete with many large and small pharmaceutical companies that are developing and/or marketing therapeutic compounds for AD, ALS and/or PD. Many large pharmaceutical companies and smaller biotechnology companies maintain well-funded research departments concentrating on therapeutic approaches to neurodegenerative diseases. ProMIS expects substantial competition from these companies as they develop different and/or novel approaches to the treatment of these diseases. Some of these approaches may directly compete with the technology that ProMIS is currently developing.
Although we believe PMN 310 currently is differentiated to other products on the market or in development, if approved, PMN310 will compete with therapies currently approved for the treatment of patients with AD, which have primarily been developed to treat the symptoms of AD rather than the underlying cause of the disease, such as memantine and cholinesterase inhibitors. PMN310 may also compete with one or more potentially disease-modifying therapeutics that target Aβ or amyloid plaques. Biogen’s aducanumab was approved by the FDA in June 2021 under the accelerated approval pathway, which allows for earlier approval of drugs that treat serious conditions, and that fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint.
Eisai and Biogen announced that the Phase 3 confirmatory AD trial of lecanemab met the primary endpoint (Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes) and all key secondary endpoints with statistically significant results in September 2022, and lecanemab received accelerated approval from FDA in January 2023. Results from Phase 3 trials of Roche’s gantenerumab were announced in November 2022, and Phase 3 testing of Lilly’s donanemab is ongoing. In many therapeutic categories, after initial approvals validate a general mechanistic approach, competitive dynamics are driven by relative safety, efficacy, convenience, and cost effectiveness. We expect this will be the case in the anti-amyloid immunotherapy category.
Other companies known to be developing therapies with Aβ/amyloid plaque-related targets include Alzheon, Inc., Alzinova AB, Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Cognition Therapeutics, Inc., Eisai Co., Ltd., Eli Lilly and Company, Grifols, S.A., KalGene Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Neurimmune AG, Novartis AG, Acumen Pharmaceuticals Inc., Prothena Biosciences, Inc., Roche Holding AG (including Genentech, its wholly owned subsidiary) and Wren Therapeutics, Inc. Additionally, PMN310, if approved, may also compete with other potential therapies intended to address underlying causes of AD that are being developed by several companies, including AbbVie Inc., AC Immune SA, Alector, Inc., Anavex Life Sciences Corp., Annovis Bio, Inc., Athira Pharma, Inc., Biohaven Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cassava Sciences, Inc., Cortexyme, Inc., Denali Therapeutics, Inc., Johnson & Johnson (including Janssen, its wholly-owned subsidiary) and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. Some of these competitors are developing therapies that either seek to block the aggregation of amyloid oligomers (for example, Alzheon, Inc.), or mitigate the toxicity of amyloid oligomers (for example, Cognition Therapeutics, Inc.). These and other therapies may end up being used as complementary therapies in clinical practice, in addition to antibodies targeting aggregated amyloid.
In the intense competitive environment that is the human pharmaceutical industry, those companies that complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approval and commercialize their therapeutic products first may enjoy competitive advantages. ProMIS believes that it will develop compounds with characteristics that may enable them, if fully developed, to have a market impact. A number of major human pharmaceutical companies have significant programs to develop drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative disease. These companies include Eisai/Pfizer, Novartis, Merck, Genentech, Lilly, Biogen, Amgen and Johnson & Johnson.
Proprietary Protection
ProMIS has acquired the rights to certain proprietary discovery platforms for the identification of proteins involved in misfolding diseases embodied in various national and international patent applications. ProMIS has also filed international patent applications related to immunotherapy targeting toxic forms of SOD1 and TDP-43 for ALS, toxic oligomers of Aβ for AD and toxic aggregates for a-syn for PD to further protect its intellectual property rights related to its therapeutic programs. In addition, the Company has obtained proprietary rights to two computational algorithms (ProMISTM and 

39



Collective Coordinates) for identification of DSEs in protein misfolding diseases as well as predicted DSEs against multiple disease targets. ProMIS intends to aggressively protect the commercial applications for diagnostic, therapeutic and prophylactic applications of these discoveries. In addition, ProMIS has developed know-how, which it may elect to keep as trade secrets and not publicly disclose in patent applications.
Human Capital Management
ProMIS seeks to hire qualified scientists and key employees as needed. As of December 31, 2022, the Company employed six full-time employees and one part-time employee. The remainder of the scientists and key personnel had consulting agreements with ProMIS.
Our future success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel, maintain our culture, and ensure diversity and inclusion in our board, management and broader workforce. Our human resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards. As these areas directly impact our ability to compete and innovate, they are key focus areas for our board of directors and senior executives.
