Background
 
We were formed as a Delaware corporation on June 20, 2014, for the purpose of engaging in the business of recycling metals through a novel, proprietary and patent-pending process that we developed and named “AquaRefining.” In 2015, Aqua Metals developed a breakthrough metal recycling technology that utilizes a clean, closed-loop process that can produce high-purity metal. We believe this innovative approach can deliver raw materials back into the manufacturing supply chain, while reducing emissions and toxic byproducts and creating a safer work environment. In particular, the modular AquaRefining systems have already demonstrated the ability to recover critical minerals from both lead acid batteries and lithium-ion batteries and can reduce the cost and environmental impact of battery recycling.
 
In 2017, Aqua Metals initially applied this breakthrough technology in the lead acid battery (LAB) recycling industry, building its first integrated recycling system for breaking LAB and recovering pure metal from the resulting scrap. In 2018, we commenced sale of finished products of AquaRefined lead to market in the form of either two tonne blocks or lead ingots for battery manufacturing. In 2019, we operated our demonstration AquaRefinery at commercial quantity production levels and produced over 35,000 AquaRefined ingots through twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week for sustained periods of time.
 
On November 29, 2019, a fire occurred in the AquaRefining area of the lead recycling facility at Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center (TRIC). The fire was caused by contracting activities happening on site, and not related to the technology or process of AquaRefining. The Company and the insurance carriers agreed on a total claim of $30.25 million which was paid in full by the carriers. Plant clean-up and repair of fire damaged areas began in 2021 and were completed in 2022. 
 
During 2020, we engaged in the pursuit of our business strategy that is based on finding licensing opportunities within the lead battery recycling marketplace. During 2020 and 2021, we successfully iterated our lead AquaRefining ‘Aqualyzer’ through a 1.25 and a 1.5 version which tripled the throughput of the 2019 iteration that produced over 35,000 industry standard ingots in commercial production.  During the third and fourth quarters of 2022, we deployed and operated the first phase of lead AquaRefining with our partner ACME Metal in Taiwan. The operation continues to successfully produced lead. The two installed Aqualyers are producing at demonstration levels.
 
In February 2021, we announced our entry into the lithium-ion battery (LiB) recycling market through a key provisional patent we filed that applies the same innovative AquaRefining approach. In August 2021, we announced we had established our Innovation Center in TRIC focused on applying our proven technology to LiB recycling research and development and prototyping. Our strategic decision to apply our proven clean, closed-loop hydrometallurgical and electrochemical recycling experience to lithium-ion battery recycling is designed to meet the growing demand for critical metals driven by the global transition to electric vehicles; growth in Internet data centers; and alternative energy applications including solar, wind, and grid-scale storage. 
 
During the first half of 2022, we announced our ability to recover copper, lithium hydroxide, nickel, and cobalt from lithium-ion battery black mass at the Company’s Innovation Center. During 2022, we built our fully-integrated pilot system, located within the Company’s Innovation Center, which is designed to allow Aqua Metals to be the first company in North America to recycle battery minerals from black mass, sell them in the U.S. and position the Company as the first LiB recycler in North America to align with the U.S. government’s goal of retaining strategic battery minerals within the domestic supply chain.
 
During 2022, we conducted environmental comparisons based on Argonne National Lab’s modeling of lithium battery supply chains – called EverBatt. The initial results indicate that AquaRefining is a cleaner approach to LiB recycling, producing far less CO2 waste streams than smelting or chemical driven hydrometallurgical processes currently on the market. In December 2022, we completed equipment installation and began to operate our first-of-a-kind LiB recycling facility, utilizing electricity to recycle instead of intensive chemical processes, fossil fuels, or high-temperature furnaces. In January of 2023, Aqua Metals recovered its first metals from recycling lithium batteries using the patent-pending Li AquaRefining process, and is currently scaling operations at the Company’s pilot facility.
 
In February 2023, we acquired a five-acre recycling campus at TRIC. The facility is designed, when fully developed, to process up to 10,000 tonnes of lithium-ion battery material each year using our proprietary AquaRefining technology. We expect to complete development of phase one, including all equipment installation, by the end of 2023 and to commence operations at the new campus in the first quarter of 2024. We have financed the purchase of the property with a $3 million loan from an unaffiliated mortgage lender. The loan accrues interest at a fixed annual rate of 9.50%. Interest-only payments are due monthly for the first twenty-four months and the principal and all unpaid interest is due on March 1, 2025.  We have the right to prepay the loan at any time, provided that we must pay guaranteed minimum interest of $213,750 (9-months of interest). The loan agreement includes representations, warranties, and affirmative and negative covenants that are customary of institutional loan agreements. The loan is collateralized by a first priority lien on the building and site improvements.

Overview
 
Aqua Metals is seeking to reinvent metal recycling with its patented and patent-pending AquaRefining™ technologies. Aqua Metals is focused on developing cleaner and safer metals recycling through innovation. We believe our Innovation Center can expand the development of breakthrough technologies for sustainable metal recycling and deliver high-value critical minerals back into the manufacturing supply chain while reducing emissions and toxic byproducts and creating much safer work environments.
 
Unlike smelting, AquaRefining is a low-temperature, water-based process. Aqua Metals has invested in breakthrough metals recycling methodologies that we believe are environmentally responsible, economically competitive, and will help retain critical strategic metals within the U.S. while lowering reliance on unsafe and toxic mining operations. Since 2015, Aqua Metals has developed breakthrough metal recycling technologies that utilize a clean, closed-loop process that can produce ultra-high purity metals. AquaRefining is designed to deliver raw materials back into the manufacturing supply chain, and replaces the need for polluting furnaces and hazardous chemicals with electricity-powered electroplating to recover valuable metals and materials from spent batteries with higher purity, lower emissions, and minimal waste.
 
Aqua Metals has demonstrated this technology in lead acid battery recycling and is currently scaling operations for its lithium-ion battery recycling pilot facility. AquaRefining for lead uses a bio-degradable aqueous solvent and a novel ambient temperature electro-chemical process to produce lead suitable for use in new battery production. Our AquaRefining process produces lead with a purity of 99.996+%, making it the purest lead ever made from a recycling technique that is in fact purer than lead made from mining processes.
 
We are in the process of demonstrating that Li AquaRefining (which is also electricity-based and fundamentally non-polluting) can create the highest quality and highest yields of recovered minerals from lithium-ion batteries, with lower waste streams and lower costs than alternatives. With the proven ability to recover valuable metals from lithium-ion batteries at our pilot facility in TRIC, our goal is to process commercial quantities of high-purity lithium hydroxide, nickel, cobalt, manganese dioxide, and copper in pure forms that can be sold to the general metals and superalloy markets, and can be made into battery precursor compound materials with proven processes that are already used in the battery industry.
 
The Company is also exploring additional novel applications of AquaRefining across metals recycling industries at our Innovation Center, including recycling emerging battery chemistries and opportunities to develop additional products for sale to customer specifications.
 
Our Markets
 
Aqua Metals’ AquaRefining process produces high purity metals and alloys that can be returned into the battery manufacturing supply chain or sold into metals markets for use across industries. This combination of approaches and the broad applicability of the end products we aim to produce enables Aqua Metals to create low-emissions inputs for the battery supply chain or to help decarbonize other sectors that utilize these critical metals and superalloys – creating a more resilient and adaptable business model for the Company as a whole.
Metals Markets
 
Most of the minerals and metals that can be recovered in the recycling of batteries of various chemistries are also globally traded commodities. Lead, copper, cobalt, nickel, and other metals can be recovered and sold in pure metal form into these markets at the prevailing price or sold directly to a customer at a price set relative to the current market price.
 
For example, battery metals are globally traded metal commodities. Metals such as lead for LABs and nickel, cobalt, copper and lithium for LIBs are the essential components for the world’s rechargeable batteries. These metals are globally traded primarily on the London Metals Exchange (LME), although the smaller Shanghai Metals Exchange (SHME) in China also trades these elements. Conventionally in the industry, there are two separate groupings of lead: i) primary lead which refers to lead produced at primary smelters that use mined lead concentrates (generally lead sulfide) as their major feedstock, and ii) secondary lead which refers to lead smelters utilizing LABs as their main feed source. In their pure forms, the other minerals that Aqua Metals intends to recover from spent batteries can be sold into these global markets. Unlike lead markets, recycling currently makes up a smaller portion of metals like cobalt and nickel, relying almost entirely on newly mined ore and refining to meet global demand.
 
As noted above, although metals are traded as a commodity on the various global exchanges, the major sales are directly between producers/traders and users (whom are typically battery manufacturers). The LME daily price is used as the benchmark in forming the basis of physical trades, forward contracts, and hedge strategies for both primary and secondary metals, in metal form. Based on market and product knowledge with buyers of metals in the U.S. and global metals markets, different grades (termed alloys) of metal are traded at a premium to the base LME price. Metal alloys, which are typically designed specifically for the customer, are also sold at a premium above the base LME, whereas byproducts (generally lower purity, compounds, or scrap) are traded at a discount to the LME as they are based on the underlying metals content and its form.

Lead Acid Batteries
 
Although the LAB is one of the earliest battery technologies, in terms of energy capacity deployed and installed manufacturing capacity, it still dominates the battery industry today. Historically, the largest market for LABs has been as starter batteries for vehicles. However, with the increasing electrical load on modern vehicles and the adoption of additional “Stop-Start” conventional 12V “starter batteries”, LABs are evolving into more capable and higher value products. At the same time, large new markets such as Cell Tower, Data Center and Industrial back-up are adding to demand. Consequently, existing LAB production facilities are being expanded and new facilities are being built.
 
According to Grand View Research, annual lead acid battery sales are expected to nearly double to $84 billion by 2025, driving demand for lead. Similar prospects for healthy growth in the lead industry continue to be published and support continued growth in demand for lead for at least the next 20 years. We believe that grid storage and other energy storage applications linked to renewable energy (solar and wind) will also generate increased demand for LABs, where low cost, safety and reliability will make them attractive options.
 
The increase in LAB manufacturing in general and particularly in China, India, and Southeast Asia, has increased demand for lead, putting pressure on global recycling networks to meet this demand. At present, we believe that much of the LAB recycling performed outside of the U.S., Canada, the EU, Japan, and Australia is carried out in outdated facilities with poor environmental standards and insufficient enforcement. China, India, Pakistan, and South America appear to be moving toward tougher regulation and enforcement. We believe that this will drive a demand in foreign markets for less polluting LAB recycling processes.
 
The Lithium Battery Market
 
According to our sources, including Goldman Sachs, the global lithium-ion battery market was assessed at approximately USD $9 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.0% from 2020 to 2028. The growth of the market is being driven by the growing demand for the lithium-ion battery in Electric Vehicles (EVs) and grid storage which offers lightweight high-energy density solutions. The market is also being influenced by increased registration of EVs and a reduction in the price of the lithium-ion battery. Costs have been driven down a long way since 2010, when battery prices were $1,100/kWh, representing a 90% drop over ten years to about $110/kWh today. Rechargeable battery technologies are becoming key to moving from a fossil-fuel driven economy to an electrified world powered by renewable energy that can be stored.
 
More than 15 million tons of lithium-ion batteries are expected to retire between now and 2030. All major car manufacturers are working on providing electric vehicles and some are moving most of the future production to electric only vehicles.
 
Lithium Batteries
 
EV batteries are powered by a battery pack made up of individual cells. Each cell has 4 components: the cathode, anode, separator, and electrolyte. Lithium-ion batteries use different raw materials for each of the components. The most common material used for the anode is graphite. The most widely used metals for the cathode is metal oxides that are combinations of lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, and aluminum. The electrolyte is generally made using acidic salts and solvents such as sulfuric acid and there are also solid-state silicon based alternatives on the horizon. The separator is usually created using a porous, polyolefin material like polyethylene or polypropylene.
 
Lithium-ion battery recycling is the method of taking EV batteries and splitting it into its components, ultimately into the original raw materials (lithium, nickel, cobalt, etc.) that can be reused in new batteries. While making lithium-ion batteries for EVs is important to address climate change, the batteries themselves are harmful to the environment if left in landfills or burned. Currently, 5-7% of lithium-ion batteries are recycled and that must get close to 100% both to avoid environmental issues and to recapture the critical minerals in those spent batteries to feed the massive demand growth curve.  Battery recycling helps address this problem, but current pyro-based battery recycling technology (smelting) also creates harmful emissions, potentially creating new climate problems faster than they are being solved. There are alternative hydro-based technologies being attempted but they are not yet proven and rely on older methodologies that are known to create significant waste streams, potentially with more waste than product recovered, which have their own negative environmental and economic impacts.
 
AquaRefining Process
 
We developed AquaRefining to be a cleaner and modular alternative to smelting. Our process has two key elements, both of which are integral to our issued patents and pending-patent applications. The first is our use of proprietary, non-toxic solvents that dissolves metal compounds. The second is a proprietary electro-chemical process and our modular Aqualyzer cells that selectively target each critical element and converts the dissolved metal compounds into high purity metals and/or salts.
 
The AquaRefining process begins with the processing of crushed used batteries either in the form of paste (for LAB) or, black mass (for LIB). The active materials are first processed to remove sulfur and then dissolved in our solvent. Metals are plated from the solvent using our patented and patent-pending process allowing the solvent to be reused.
 
We have demonstrated at bench scale and begun to demonstrate in our pilot facility that our lithium battery AquaRefining process can generate cobalt, lithium hydroxide, copper, nickel, and manganese dioxide from lithium-ion battery black mass. A significant benefit of our AquaRefining process is that it can produce higher yields of higher purity thus higher value product than that derived from primary smelters with product from secondary sources.
 
Another significant benefit of our process is that we designed our AquaRefining equipment to be manufactured on a purpose-built production line in standard sized Aqualyzers. This is not possible with the smelting process, as smelters need to be constructed on site. This gives us the ability to provide AquaRefining systems with varying capacities to meet the specific needs of potential customers and suppliers. We have also developed an integrated software and portal called PureMetrics that keeps track of production and key operating metrics.
 
Recycling is subject to a variety of domestic and international regulations related to hazardous materials, emissions, employee safety and other matters. While our operations will be subject to these regulations, we believe that one of our potential advantages will be our ability to conduct battery recycling operations with less regulatory cost and burden than smelting operators due to the nature of our process. One of our key initiatives is and will continue to be, to educate regulators and the public as to the environmental benefits of AquaRefining. We believe that we have the potential to develop a business model that offers the opportunity to conduct, in an environmentally friendly manner, an important recycling activity that historically has been conducted in an often highly polluting manner.

Our Business Model
 
Aqua Metals is engaged in the business of applying its commercialized clean, water-based recycling technology principles to develop the clean and cost-efficient recycling solutions for both lead and lithium-ion (“Li”) batteries. Our recycling process is a patented hydro- and electrometallurgical technology that is a novel, proprietary and patented process we developed and named AquaRefining. AquaRefining is a low-emissions, closed-loop recycling technology that replaces polluting furnaces and hazardous chemicals with electricity-powered electroplating to recover valuable metals and materials from spent batteries with higher purity, lower emissions, and with minimal waste. The “Aqualyzers” cleanly generate ultra-pure metal one atom at a time, closing the sustainability loop for the rapidly growing energy storage economy.
 
Our process was originally designed for lead recycling. Lead is a globally traded commodity with a worldwide market value in excess of $20 billion. We believe our suite of patented and patent pending AquaRefining technologies will allow the lead-acid battery industry to simultaneously improve the environmental impact of lead recycling and scale recycling production to meet demand. Furthermore, our AquaRefining technologies result in high purity lead. We offer technology licensing and related services to lead recyclers across the globe for lead recycling.
 
We are also applying our commercialized clean, water-based recycling technology principles with the goal of developing the cleanest and most cost-efficient recycling solution for lithium-ion batteries. We believe our process has the potential to produce higher quality products at a lower operating cost without the damaging effects of furnaces and greenhouse emissions. Aqua Metals estimates the total addressable market for lithium-ion battery recycling will be approximately $9 billion by 2025 and grow to exceed lead battery recycling by the end of the decade. Unlike the mature lead recycling market, the deployed lithium-ion battery recycling infrastructure to serve market growth does not exist today.
 
Our business strategy is based on the pursuit of building and operating Li AquaRefining recycling capacity to meet the growing demand for critical metals in lithium-ion batteries driven by innovations in automobile batteries, growth in internet data centers, and alternative energy applications, including solar, wind, and grid-scale storage. We are also continuing to pursue equipment supply and licensing opportunities within the lead acid battery recycling marketplace.
 
We are in the process of demonstrating that Li AquaRefining, which is fundamentally non-polluting, can create the highest quality and highest yields of recovered minerals from lithium-ion batteries with lower waste streams and lower costs than existing alternatives. We have already demonstrated at our pilot facility our ability to recover key valuable minerals in lithium-ion batteries, such as lithium hydroxide, copper, nickel, cobalt, and other compounds in 2022. Our goal is to process commercial quantities of nickel, cobalt, and copper in a pure metal form that can be sold to the general metals and superalloy markets and can be made into battery precursor compound materials with known processes already used in the mining industry. We have installed, commissioned, and began to operate the first Li AquaRefining pilot plant at the end of 2022, scaling towards a commercial demonstration operation through 2023. The location for the pilot demonstration quantity is currently the Innovation Center with expansion to happen at our new 5-acre recycling campus to commercial quantities to ~10,000 tonnes / year or more of production starting in 2024, which would be enough material to build ~100,000 average EVs or ~400,000 average home energy storage systems.  At today’s metals prices, this capacity could also generate $200,000,000 plus of revenues for the company.
 
Our focus for the lead market is providing equipment and licensing of our lead acid battery recycling technologies in an enabler model which allows us to work with anyone in the industry globally and address the entire marketplace.  Our focus for the lithium market includes operating our first-of-a-kind lithium battery recycling facility, utilizing electricity to recycle instead of intensive chemical processes, fossil fuels, or high-temperature furnaces. We are also exploring partnership and/or joint venture agreements, particularly as our Li AquaRefining matures through 2023 and into 2024. We believe that Aqua Metals is in a position to become one of the few critical minerals recovery players for which our environmental and economic value proposition should generate both great commercial wins and potentially government grants to accelerate our credibility and progress. 
 
The market for lead and other lithium-ion batteries are global in scale but local in nature and execution, with large differences in local regulation, custom and practice, and access to transportation and electricity costs. In some regions, it is highly regulated, and in others it is not. Consequently, we are evolving our business model to commercialize our technology optimally across multiple locations.

Competition
 
At the present time, our primary competition in the production of lead comes from operators of existing smelters and other parties heavily invested in the existing supply chain for smelting. Our approach to this competition is to make AquaRefining available for the conversion of existing smelter-based facilities, retrofits, and new construction. However, it is prudent to assume that outside of our strategic relationships, a conversion to AquaRefining may be resisted by some of the incumbent lead producers.
 
Our development of recycling technology for lithium-ion batteries is a unique approach to extracting the high-value metals compared to the array of other potential solutions under development. Currently, smelting is the only commercially proven process for recycling lithium-ion batteries. The smelting process utilizes multiple high emissions steps with low yields to produce battery ready materials. Over the next decade and beyond, when the volume of used batteries becomes significant, smelting will likely not be a viable solution due to the negative environmental impact and likelihood of regulatory restrictions on emissions. The other technologies currently under development utilize a predominately hydrometallurgical approach that consumes significant amounts of chemicals to extract the metals resulting in high cost and excessive waste streams. Our approach is a hybrid of hydrometallurgical and electrometallurgical processes like the process we have commercialized for lead, we call it “Li AquaRefining.” We believe, and our lab scale and then bench scale and now pilot scale R&D supports, that Li AquaRefining requires less chemicals, produces less waste streams, and creates higher purity products at a lower cost as compared to both smelting and standard hydrometallurgy.
 
The lithium-ion battery recycling market is significantly different from that of the lead recycling market in that it is a nascent industry. With no predominant technology to displace, our goal is to enable new and existing recyclers across the globe with Li AquaRefining as a best-in-class solution for meeting the supply chain demands of the lithium-ion battery industry as well as meeting the environmental needs of the planet and the corporations seeking to achieve net zero emissions.
 
Intellectual Property Rights
 
We regard the protection of our technologies and intellectual property rights as an important element of our business operations and crucial to our success. We endeavor to generate and protect our intellectual property assets through a series of patents, trademarks, internal and external policy and procedures and contractual provisions.
Patent Portfolio
 
Currently, we have secured 9 US patents, 91 international patents, and 2 allowances (international). In addition to the US patents, we have international patents/allowances in the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization, African Intellectual Property Organization, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, the Eurasian Patent Organization, European Union, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, South Korea, South Africa, Turkey, Ukraine, and Vietnam. We also have 50 US and foreign patent applications pending with patent applications pending in 21 additional non-US jurisdictions across ten distinct patent applications relating to certain elements of the technology underlying our AquaRefining process and related apparatus and chemical formulations. The claims of the granted patents substantially address the same subject matter and are drawn to various aspects of processing lead materials using an aqua refining process. Differences in the claim number and scope are due to local rules and practice.
 
We intend to continue to prepare and file domestic and foreign patent applications covering expanding aspects and applications of our technology, as circumstances warrant.
 
There can be no assurance that any patents will issue from any of our current or any future applications. Also, any patents that may issue may not survive a legal challenge to their scope, validity, or enforceability, or provide significant protection for us. Competitors may work around our patents, so they are not infringing. Our patent portfolio and our existing policy and procedures safeguarding our trade secrets nonetheless may face challenges so that our competitors can copy our AquaRefining process.

Trade Secrets and Contract Protection
 
We have developed our internal policy and procedures in safeguarding our trade secrets and proprietary information. Our procedures generally require our employees, consultants, and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except under specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreements provide that all of the technology that is conceived by the individual during the course of employment is our exclusive property. The development of our technology and many of our processes are dependent upon the knowledge, experience, and skills of key scientific and technical personnel.
Government Regulation
 
Our operations and the operations of our licensees in the United States will be subject to the federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws applicable to the reclamation of LABs and lithium based batteries. While the reclamation process itself is generally not subject to federal permitting requirements, depending on how any particular operation is structured, our facilities and the facilities of our licensees may have to obtain environmental permits or approvals from federal, state or local regulators to operate, including permits or regulatory approvals related to air emissions, water discharges, waste management, and the storage of batteries on-site should that become necessary. We may face opposition from local residents or public interest groups to the installation and operation of our or our licensee's facilities. Failure to secure (or significant delays in securing) the necessary approvals could prevent us from pursuing some of our planned operations and adversely affect our business, financial results, and growth prospects.
 
In addition to permitting requirements, our operations and the operations of our licensees are subject to environmental health, safety and transportation laws and regulations that govern the management of and exposure to hazardous materials such as the lead, acids, and other metals involved in reclamation. These include hazard communication and other occupational safety requirements for employees, which may mandate industrial hygiene monitoring of employees for potential exposure to lead. Failure to comply with these requirements could subject our business to significant penalties (civil or criminal) and other sanctions that could adversely affect our business. Changes to these regulatory requirements in the future could also increase our costs, require changes in or cessation of certain activities, and adversely affect the business.
 
The nature of our operations and the operations of our licensees involves risks, including the potential for exposure to hazardous materials such as lead, that could result in personal injury and property damage claims from third parties, including employees and neighbors, which claims could result in significant costs or other environmental liability. Our operations and the operations of our licensees also pose a risk of releases of hazardous substances, such as lead, acids, and other metals related to lithium batteries into the environment, which can result in liabilities for the removal or remediation of such hazardous substances from the properties at which they have been released, liabilities which can be imposed regardless of fault, and our business could be held liable for the entire cost of cleanup even if we were only partially responsible. Like any manufacturer, we and our licensees are also subject to the possibility that we may receive notices of potential liability in connection with materials that were sent to third-party recycling, treatment, and/or disposal facilities under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (“CERCLA”), and comparable state statutes, which impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault or the legality of the conduct that contributed to the contamination, and for damages to natural resources. Liability under CERCLA is retroactive, and, under certain circumstances, liability for the entire cost of a cleanup can be imposed on any responsible party.
 
As our business expands outside of the United States, our licensed operations will be subject to the environmental, health and safety laws of the countries where we do business, including permitting and compliance requirements that address the similar risks as do the laws in the United States, as well as international legal requirements such as those applicable to the transportation of hazardous materials. Depending on the country or region, these laws could be as stringent as those in the US, or they could be less stringent or not as strictly enforced. In some countries in which we are interested in expanding our business, such as South America, Taiwan and China, the relevant environmental regulatory and enforcement frameworks are in flux and subject to change. Therefore, while compliance with these requirements will cause our business to incur costs, and failure to comply with these requirements could adversely affect our business, it is difficult to evaluate such potential costs or adverse impacts until such time as we decide to initiate operations in particular countries outside the United States.
