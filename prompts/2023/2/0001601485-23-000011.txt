Item 1. Business
Overview
We had been a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel small molecule therapeutics to address chronic and progressive fibrotic diseases, prior to our 2022 Strategic Realignment. Our goal was to transform the treatment paradigm for patients suffering from these potentially life-threatening conditions for which there are no approved medicines or where existing approved medicines have known limitations. Our product candidates and programs included ANG-3070, a highly selective oral tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor (TKI) in development as a treatment for fibrotic diseases, a ROCK2 preclinical program targeted towards the treatment of fibrotic diseases, a CYP11B2 preclinical program targeted towards diseases related to aldosterone synthase dysregulation, and a CYP26 (retinoic acid metabolism) inhibitor program targeted towards a number of indications, including cancer, and ANG-3777, a hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) mimetic. If we do not complete the merger transaction with Elicio Therapeutices, Inc. (Elicio) , we expect to move forward with developing ANG-3070 and conducting further preclinical studies for our ROCK2 program.
On January 17, 2023, we entered into a definitive merger agreement with Elicio under which Elicio will merge with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Angion in an all-stock transaction (the “Merger”). Upon completion of the Merger, the combined company will focus on advancing Elicio’s proprietary lymph node AMP technology to develop immunotherapies, with a focus on ELI-002, a therapeutic cancer vaccine targeting mKRAS-driven tumors. 
Our 2022 Strategic Realignment was announced following our June 2022 termination of our Phase 2 “JUNIPER” dose-finding trial for ANG-3070 in patients with primary proteinuric kidney diseases, specifically focal segmental glomerulorsclerosis (FSGS) and immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN). The JUNIPER trial was terminated in the interests of patient safety based upon a reassessment of the risk/benefit profile of ANG-3070 in patients with established serious kidney disease. We completed the data collection work necessary related to the JUNIPER trial to ascertain whether the drug had any effect, positive or negative, in patients with fibrotic kidney diseases and determined there was no economically-viable path forward for ANG-3070 in primary proteinuric kidney diseases.
ANG-3070
Prior to the termination of the Phase 2 study, we had been focused on developing ANG-3070 in for fibrotic diseases in the kidney and lung. We continue to believe that, notwithstanding the termination of the ANG-3070 program in kidney indication, ANG-3070 could be a viable development candidate in lung indications such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). 
Pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by progressive scarring (fibrosis) of the lungs, which leads to their deterioration and destruction. Over time, patients’ lung scarring progresses and breathing becomes difficult, often resulting in the lungs failing to take in enough oxygen to meet the body’s needs.
IPF is an aggressive form of pulmonary fibrosis with a median survival of two to three years from diagnosis. The course of the disease is highly variable. Certain patients become seriously ill within a few months, while others may survive for five years or longer. Most deaths in IPF occur from progression of pulmonary fibrosis leading to respiratory failure. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), approximately 140,000 people in the United States have IPF, and approximately 30,000 to 40,000 new cases are diagnosed each year, usually affecting people between the ages of 50 to 70. EU incidence rates are estimated to be similar. Over half are undiagnosed in the mild category alone, while more could be underdiagnosed. The disease is of unknown cause and represents an important area of unmet medical need.
There are currently two approved therapies for IPF, pirfenidone (Esbriet®, sold by Roche/Genentech) and the kinase inhibitor nintedanib (OFEV®, sold by Boehringer-Ingelheim). Nintedanib is also approved for SSc-ILD patients. Both drugs have known tolerability challenges for patients. Diarrhea and nausea are very common side effects, with 62% of patients taking nintedanib reporting diarrhea and 29% reporting nausea according to its drug label. Similarly, diarrhea was reported by 26% and nausea by 36% of patients taking pirfenidone according to its label. Patient convenience is also a recognized challenge, with nintedanib required to be dosed twice per day with food and pirfenidone three times per day with food after a three-step titration over the first two weeks. Patient drop-out rates for both drugs are substantial, with 43.8% of patients on nintedanib and 51.5% of patients on pirfenidone 
Table of Contents

dropping out after 12 months. Neither therapy demonstrated an impact on patient survival in the clinical trials forming the basis for their approval. Due to the recognized limitations of these approved medicines, under 30% of U.S. patients diagnosed with IPF, despite it being a life-threatening disease, are prescribed nintedanib or pirfenidone.
Despite these drawbacks to tolerability, convenience, and efficacy, pirfenidone and nintedanib generated approximately $3.8 billion in combined 2021 worldwide sales. If we are able to demonstrate in clinical trials ANG-3070 provides IPF patients with an alternative treatment option with a more acceptable tolerability, convenience, and/or efficacy profile, we would expect ANG-3070, if approved, to compete successfully with these two approved medicines. However, there is no guarantee ANG-3070 will be able to achieve these goals or, if it does, generate comparable revenues.
The next steps for the ANG-3070 program would be additional preclinical and/or clinical work to confirm target engagement and dose levels in patients with IPF. In anticipation of the announced Merger, however, we have suspended the advancement of ANG-3070 in preclinical or clinical studies. Absent completion of the transaction with Elicio, we could move forward with this program. We hold global rights to the ANG-3070 program.
ANG-3777
In 2022, we completed preclinical work and the process of closing out analyses of data from the 2021 clinical trial readouts of ANG-3777, that was formerly our lead product candidate until December 2021. We have shared these data with our license partner Vifor International, Ltd, (Vifor Pharma) and conversations continue on next steps for the program, if any. We do not intend to continue the clinical development plan for ANG-3777 set forth in the Vifor License, which had included a Phase 3 study for the prevention of AKI in patients undergoing cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass (CSA-AKI) and a Phase 4 confirmatory study in donor kidney transplant patients who were at risk for developing delayed graft function (DGF), given we do not believe the earlier Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trial results in the respective indications support regulatory approval. 
ROCK2, CYP11B2 and CYP26 
During 2022, we also conducted activities in our ROCK2, CYP11B2 and CYP26 preclinical programs.
ROCK2
Our ROCK2 program includes a number of highly selective, oral small molecule inhibitors of ROCK2 developed internally as a potential treatment for fibrotic and other diseases. Over the past year, we conducted additional chemistry work resulting in additional libraries of ROCK(Rho-associated coiled-coil forming protein kinase)-targeting compounds with differing ratios of ROCK2 and ROCK1 selectivity ranging from 300-fold to 1,600-fold selectivity for ROCK2 versus ROCK1 with promising bioavailability. 
ROCK signal transduction pathways are implicated in the development of fibrosis. Inhibition of ROCK isoforms ROCK1 and ROCK2 have shown promise in fibrosis and cardiovascular remodeling diseases. However, ROCK1 inhibition has been associated with hypotension (low blood pressure) and enhanced vascular permeability. 
Recent scientific work using specific genetic or pharmacological reduction of ROCK2 indicates ROCK2 inhibition by itself can result in anti-fibrotic activity without causing hypotension. These findings informed our strategy to develop a ROCK2-specific inhibitor, with the goal of minimizing ROCK1 inhibition, as a potential treatment for fibrosis and other diseases. We believe this approach could translate into product candidates with enhanced tolerability potentially supporting long-term systemic use. 
Multiple dual ROCK1/2 inhibitors have received regulatory approval, including ripasudil (Glanatec®), which is approved in Japan for treating glaucoma and ocular hypertension, fasudil (ErilTM), which is approved in Japan and China for treating cerebral vasospasm in hemorrhagic stroke, and netarsudil (Rhopressa®), which is approved in the United States for the treatment of glaucoma. The ROCK2-selective inhibitor belumosudil has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease.
Elevated expression of ROCK2 has been implicated in a number of chronic fibrotic conditions and other diseases. ROCK2 is significantly upregulated in fibrotic kidneys in both pediatric and adult patients, with ROCK2 levels positively correlated with the severity of the fibrosis. Study of ROCK2 inhibition in the unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model of renal fibrosis showed ROCK2 inhibition alleviates renal fibrosis. Furthermore, in a 
Table of Contents

mouse model of IPF, researchers found mice with either ROCK1 or ROCK2 genetically deleted were protected from bleomycin-induced IPF, indicating specifically targeting either ROCK isoform would be an effective therapeutic strategy against IPF. ROCK2 expression in vitro has also been associated with co-expression of fibrotic liver markers. Elevated ROCK2 levels are seen in cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis and diastolic dysfunction. ROCK2 has also been shown to play a role in neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. As a result, we believe a potent ROCK2 inhibitor should prevent disease progression in chronic fibrotic diseases and potentially be useful in a variety of other cardiac and neurodegenerative disorders.
Dual ROCK1/2 inhibitors can have problematic side effects including hypotension and increased vascular permeability. In an in vitro analysis measuring binding affinity for ROCK2 and ROCK1, our ROCK2 selective inhibitors show much stronger binding affinity for ROCK2 versus ROCK1. We believe high selectivity for ROCK2 could provide enhanced tolerability, potentially supporting long-term systemic use.
We hold global rights to our ROCK2 inhibitor program. Currently, we are completing certain discovery and preclinical activities in our ROCK2 program, and absent completion of the announced Merger, we could move forward with this program, which is also currently available for out-licensing. Given the early stage of the program, prior to a lead candidate being selected, investors should not expect any significant funds would be generated from a transaction, or even such a transaction occurring.
CYP11B2
We created a selection of inhibitor molecules with high specificity to CYP11B2 (aldosterone synthase) relative to CYP11B1, which we were investigating for the purpose of targeting aldosterone-related diseases including resistant hypertension, congestive heart failure, renal fibrosis, and primary hyperaldosteronism. 
Aldosterone is a hormone produced in the adrenal glands which helps control the body's blood pressure by causing the kidneys to retain salt and excrete potassium, thereby increasing water retention, blood volume and blood pressure. CYP11B2 is a member of the broad cytochrome P450 family and is responsible for the biosynthesis of aldosterone. There are a number of diseases associated with dysregulated aldosterone, including primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's Syndrome), refractory hypertension, congestive heart failure and kidney fibrosis. As a result, we believe inhibition of CYP11B2 could potentially be used in aldosterone-related diseases. We have determined not to proceed with this program. 
CYP26 
We also worked on a CYP26 (retinoic acid metabolism) inhibitor program targeted towards a number of indications, including cancer. The CYP26 program focuses on selective and potent inhibitors of CYP26, which is responsible for the degradation of retinoic acid. Retinoic acid, primarily in the form of ATRA (all-trans retinoic acid) has been used both topically and systemically to treat conditions including acne, acyte promyelocytic leukemia, and photoaging. In a variety of animal models, we demonstrated CYP26 inhibition can increase retinoic acid levels in target tissue while reducing systemic exposure of retinoic acid. We hold global rights to our CYP26 inhibitor program. We have determined not to proceed with this program, other than under our exclusive license agreement with Ohr Cosmetics LLC. 
Manufacturing
We have relied on third-party contract manufacturing organizations to manufacture and supply product candidates for our clinical trials. Currently, we have agreements with a single third-party contract manufacturer to supply the drug substance for ANG-3070 and with a single third-party contract manufacturer to manufacture all clinical trial supplies of ANG-3070. Currently, we believe we have sufficient inventory of ANG 3070 to meet the immediate requirements of potential future clinical trials, which may be conducted absent the completion of the announced Merger. 
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Our potential competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and universities and other research institutions. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative 
Table of Contents

arrangements with large, established companies. We believe the key competitive factors affecting the development and commercial success of our product candidates will be whether or not such product candidates are deemed to be safe and effective by relevant regulatory authorities, as well as their tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price, and reimbursement. Absent the completion of the announced Merger, we could face significant competition in our ANG-3070 program for IPF from both approved therapies such as pirfenidone (Esbriet®, sold by Roche/Genentech) for IPF and nintedanib (OFEV®, sold by Boehringer Ingleheim) and from product candidates in development for IPF, such as PLN-74809 from Pliant Therapeutics for IPF, BI 1015550 from Boehringer Ingelheim, pamrevlumab from FibroGen, and other companies. We would also face competition for our ROCK2 program from Kadmon Holdings, Inc.'s belumosudil (KD025) and RXC007/RXC008 from Redx Pharma as well as other companies developing ROCK inhibitors.
Intellectual Property
The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our product candidates, processes and know-how are important to our business. We pursue various avenues of intellectual property protection, including consideration of patent, trademark, and trade secret strategies. We have sought patent protection in the United States and internationally for our programs relating to small molecule compounds with our tyrosine kinase inhibitors (including ANG-3070), HGF-like activity (including ANG-3777), our ROCK2 inhibitors and our CYP inhibitors. Our patent strategy seeks to protect our product candidates by filing patent applications, in the United States and in relevant foreign jurisdictions, and we pursue multi-faceted protection, as available, for example to relevant small molecule compounds and analogs, pharmaceutical compositions and related methods of manufacture and use. Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights in order to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to our business. We also rely on trade secret protection for certain intellectual property that may be important to the development of our business and expect to pursue trademark registrations for brand names or other text or images that may provide commercial value.
In the United States and worldwide, issued patents have a presumptive term, assuming all maintenance fees are paid, of twenty years from their earliest non-provisional filing date. Certain jurisdictions offer opportunities to extend this term. For example, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) may add term to a patent (referred to as Patent Term Adjustment) if delays by the USPTO of certain activities exceed prespecified durations, from which delays by the Applicant are subtracted. Additionally, many jurisdictions, including the United States and Europe, provide opportunities for extending the term of patents relating to approved pharmaceutical products or their approved uses. In the United States, a single patent can be extended per approved product, for a period (referred to as Patent Term Extension) of up to five years, depending on the dates of patent issuance relative to submission of an application for premarketing approval (i.e., of a NDA or a BLA) under provisions of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. Similar restoration of term is available in Europe under so-called Supplementary Protection Certificate rights, and extensions under similar policies may be available in other countries.
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, if any, one or more of our patents may be eligible for limited Patent Term Extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act in the United States, Supplementary Protection Certificate in Europe.
Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and/or other intellectual property protection for our current and future product candidates, including for their use, production, formulation, etc., with commercially relevant terms; our commercial success may also depend in part on our ability to successfully defend our patent and/or other intellectual property rights against third-party challenges. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell and/or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable intellectual property rights that cover these activities. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates, discovery programs and processes. Additionally, we cannot be certain that we will always be able to establish sufficient ownership rights to ensure complete or necessary control over our intellectual property rights as required in order to obtain, maintain, and/or enforce them. For these and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property." The expiration dates of the patents discussed below assume in all cases that the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees are paid to maintain the patent(s) in force for the full extent of their term and any extension(s) thereof.

Licenses and Collaborations
License Agreement with Vifor Pharma
In November 2020, we granted Vifor Pharma, an exclusive, global (excluding Greater China), royalty-bearing license (the Vifor License), for the commercialization of ANG-3777 in all Renal Indications, beginning with DGF and CSA-AKI. The Vifor License also grants Vifor Pharma exclusive rights, with a right to sublicense subject to our consent for certain specified conditions, to develop and manufacture ANG-3777 for commercialization in Renal Indications worldwide (excluding Greater China) in cooperation with us or independently. We retain the right to develop and commercialize combination therapy products combining ANG-3777 with our other proprietary molecules, subject to Vifor Pharma's right of first negotiation with respect to global (excluding Greater China) rights to such combination therapy products in the Renal Indications. Although the Vifor License includes additional milestone and royalty objectives, we do not expect to receive any clinical, post-approval, or sales milestones, or royalties, as we do not intend to continue to pursue the clinical development plan for ANG-3777, which had included a Phase 3 study for CSA-AKI and a phase 4 confirmatory study in DGF. We and Vifor continue to discuss the analyses of the results of the clinical trials announced in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the future of the collaboration.
Collaboration with the University of Michigan
In 2019, we entered into a subcontractor agreement with The Regents of the University of Michigan (UM), 
under which we provided funding for identification of ANG-3070-responsive disease marker profiles in rodent models, and their intersection with existing data on patients with various forms of nephrotic kidney disease, to identify potential ANG-3070-responsive patient subsets. Under this agreement we obtained access to the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE), an integrated group of academic centers, patient support organizations and clinical resources dedicated to advancing the treatment of kidney disorders. The goal of work under this agreement, which we support through a grant from the U.S. Department of Defense, is to identify human disease and drug response profiles based upon the genes, networks and pathways that correlate with the therapeutic activity of ANG-3070 in primary FSGS and other fibrotic renal diseases. We are obligated to provide to UM up to a total of $520,000 over the course of the project. We have an option to license and commercialize intellectual property generated during the term of the agreement that is solely owned by UM under commercially reasonable terms. On March 21, 2022, we provided written notice to UM of our intention to terminate the subcontractor agreement as we believe the work under the related U.S. Department of Defense grant to be complete. 
Collaboration with Ohr Cosmetics LLC
In November 2013, we granted Ohr an exclusive worldwide license, with the right to sublicense, under our patent rights covering one of our CYP26 inhibitors, for the use in treating conditions of the skin or hair. Sublicensees 
Table of Contents

may not grant further sublicenses under our patent rights other than to affiliates of such sublicensees and entities with which sublicensees are collaborating for the research, development, manufacture and commercialization of the products. Ohr will pay us a royalty at a rate in the low single digits on gross revenue of products incorporating ANG‑3522, and milestone payments potentially totaling up to $9.0 million based on achievement of sales milestones. Royalties and milestone payments will be paid until the later of 15 years from the first commercial sale of a licensed product or the last to expire licensed patent rights. The royalty rate is subject to adjustments under certain circumstances. The Ohr License represents a related-party transaction, as discussed in our financial statements included in Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K below, and we believe the Ohr License was made on terms no less favorable to us than those we could obtain from unaffiliated third parties. On February 5, 2023, we and Ohr executed the First Amendment to the Ohr license agreement. This amendment allows Ohr access to our CYP26 inhibitors beyond ANG-3522 for the use in treating conditions of the skin and hair, eliminates our obligation to prosecute or maintain the patents rights licensed to Ohr at its principal expense, and allows Ohr to prosecute and maintain such patent rights its sole own expense. No revenue from this license agreement was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022 or 2021. 
Government Regulation and Product Approval
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, marketing and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of drugs, such as those we are developing. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Drug Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations. FDA approval is required before any new drug can be marketed in the United States. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA clinical holds, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
▪completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA's Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations;
▪submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (IND) which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
▪approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) representing each clinical site before a clinical study may be initiated;
▪performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice (GCP) regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;
▪preparation of and submission to the FDA of a new drug application (NDA);
▪satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
▪a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the application for review;
▪satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility(ies) where the product is manufactured to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) regulations, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCP; and
▪FDA review and approval of an NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for its particular labeled uses in the United States.

International Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we could become subject to a variety of foreign regulations regarding development, approval, commercial sales and distribution of our products if we seek to market our product candidates in other jurisdictions. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional review periods, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
