ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
 
Our mission is to provide simple useful services that help people unlock the power of the Internet.
 
We accomplish this by reducing the complexity of our customers’ experience as they access the Internet (at home or on the go) and while using Internet services such as domain name registration, email and other Internet services. In the prior year, we disclosed three operating and reportable segments: Fiber Internet Services, Domain Services and Mobile Services. During the first quarter of 2022, the Company completed a reorganization of its reporting structure into three operating and reportable segments: Fiber Internet Services, Platform Services and Domain Services. In the third quarter of 2022, the Company renamed its three operating and reportable segments to reflect their branded names: Ting, Wavelo and Tucows Domains. The change to our reportable operating segments was the result of a shift in our business and management structures that was completed during the first quarter of 2022. The operations supporting what was previously known as our Mobile Services segment have become increasingly operationally distinct between our mobile retail services and our platform services. As a result, commencing in the first quarter of 2022, our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), who is also our chief decision maker, reviews the operating results of Ting, Wavelo and Tucows Domains as three distinct segments in order to make key operating decisions as well as evaluate segment performance. Certain revenues and expenses disclosed under the Corporate category are excluded from segment earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") results as they are centrally managed and not monitored by or reported to our CEO by segment, including Mobile Retail Services, eliminations of intercompany transactions, portions of Finance and Human Resources that are centrally managed, Legal and Corporate IT. We are now both organized and managed, and also report our financial results as three segments: Ting, Wavelo and Tucows Domains. The three segments are differentiated primarily by their services, the markets they serve and the regulatory environments in which they operate.
 
Our management regularly reviews our operating results on a consolidated basis, principally to make decisions about how we utilize our resources and to measure our consolidated operating performance. To assist us in forecasting growth and to help us monitor the effectiveness of our operational strategies, our management regularly reviews revenue for each of our service offerings in order to gain more depth and understanding of the key business metrics driving our business. 
 
Ting
 
Ting and its wholly owned subsidiaries - Cedar and Simply Bits includes the provision of high-speed Internet access services to select towns throughout the United States, with further expansion underway to both new and existing markets. Our primary sales channel is through the Ting website. The primary focus of this segment is to provide reliable Fiber and Fixed Wireless Internet services to consumer and business customers. Revenues are all generated in the U.S. and are billed on a monthly basis and have no fixed contract terms.
 
As of December 31, 2022, Ting Internet had access to 96,000 owned infrastructure serviceable addresses, 20,000 partner infrastructure serviceable addresses and 35,000 active accounts under its management; compared to having access to 76,000 owned infrastructure serviceable addresses, 15,000 partner infrastructure serviceable addresses and 26,000 active accounts under its management as of December 31, 2021. These figures exclude the increase in serviceable addresses and accounts attributable to the Simply Bits acquisition. 
 
Wavelo
 
Wavelo includes the provision of full-service platforms and professional services providing a variety of solutions that support Communication Services Providers ("CSPs"), including subscription and billing management, network orchestration and provisioning, and individual developer tools. Wavelo's focus is to provide accessible telecom software to CSPs globally, minimizing network and technical barriers and improving internet access worldwide. Wavelo's suite of flexible, cloud-based software simplifies the management of mobile and internet network access, enabling CSPs to better utilize their existing infrastructure, focus on customer experience and scale their businesses faster. Wavelo launched as a proven asset for CSPs, with DISH using Wavelo’s Mobile Network Operating System ("MONOS") software to drive additional value within its Digital Operator Platform since 2021. More recently, Ting Internet has also integrated Wavelo’s Internet Service Operating System ("ISOS") and Subscriber Management ("SM") software to enable faster subscriber growth and footprint expansion. The Wavelo segment also includes the Platypus brand and platform, our legacy billing solution for internet service providers (each an "ISP" and collectively, "ISPs"), that was previously reported under the Ting segment. Wavelo revenues from MONOS, ISOS, SM and professional services are all generated in the U.S. and our customer agreements have set contract lengths with the underlying CSP. Similarly, Platypus revenues are largely generated in the U.S., with a small portion earned in Canada and other countries.

Tucows Domains
 
Tucows Domains includes wholesale and retail domain name registration services, as well as value added services derived through our OpenSRS, eNom, Ascio, EPAG and Hover brands. We earn revenues primarily from the registration fees charged to resellers in connection with new, renewed and transferred domain name registrations. In addition, we earn revenues from the sale of retail domain name registration and email services to individuals and small businesses. Tucows Domains revenues are attributed to the country in which the contract originates, which is primarily in Canada and the U.S. for OpenSRS and eNom brands. Ascio domain services contracts and EPAG agreements primarily originate in Europe.
 
Our primary distribution channel is a global network of approximately 35,000 resellers that operate in over 150 countries and who typically provide their customers, the end-users of Internet-based services, with solutions for establishing and maintaining an online presence. Our primary focus is serving the needs of this network of resellers by providing the broadest portfolio of gTLD and the country code top-level domain options and related services, a white-label platform that facilitates the provisioning and management of domain names, a powerful Application Program Interface, easy-to-use interfaces, comprehensive management and reporting tools, and proactive and attentive customer service. Our services are integral to the solutions that our resellers deliver to their customers. We provide “second tier” support to our resellers by email, chat and phone in the event resellers experience issues or problems with our services. In addition, our Network Operating Center proactively monitors all services and network infrastructure to address deficiencies before customer services are impacted.
 
We believe that the underlying platforms for our services are among the most mature, reliable and functional reseller-oriented provisioning and management platforms in our industry, and we continue to refine, evolve and improve these services for both resellers and end-users. Our business model is characterized primarily by non-refundable, up-front payments, which lead to recurring revenue from renewals and positive operating cash flow.
 
Wholesale, primarily branded as OpenSRS, eNom, EPAG and Ascio, derives revenue from its domain registration service and from providing value-added services. The OpenSRS, eNom, EPAG and Ascio domain services manage 24 million domain names under the Tucows, eNom, EPAG and Ascio ICANN registrar accreditations and for other registrars under their own accreditations.
 
Value-added services include hosted email which provides email delivery and webmail access to millions of mailboxes, Internet security services, Internet hosting, WHOIS privacy, publishing tools and other value-added services. All of these services are made available to end-users through a network of 35,000 web hosts, ISPs and other resellers around the world. In addition, we also derive revenue by monetizing domain names which are near the end of their lifecycle through expiry auction sale.
 
Retail, primarily the Hover and eNom portfolio of websites, including eNom and eNom Central, derive revenues from the sale of domain name registration and email services to individuals and small businesses. Our retail domain services also include our Personal Names Service – based on over 36,000 surname domains – that allows roughly two-thirds of Americans to purchase an email address based on their last name. The retail segment now includes the sale of the rights to its portfolio of surname domains used in connection with our RealNames email service as well as our Exact Hosting Service, that provides Linux hosting services for individual and small business websites.
 
Additional information about segments can be found in “Note 19 – Segment Reporting” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We believe that we are well positioned in the wholesale domain registration and email markets due in part to our highly-recognized “Tucows”, “OpenSRS”, “Ascio” and “eNom” brands and the respect they confer on us as a defender of end-user rights and reseller-friendly approaches to doing business. We were among the first group of 34 registrars to be accredited by ICANN in 1999, and we remain active in Internet governance issues.
 
Our success and ability to compete depend on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our brand name and technology. We rely on a combination of trademark, trade secret and copyright laws, as well as contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property rights.
 
We have registered the Tucows trademark in the United States, Canada and the European Union and we register additional service marks and trademarks as appropriate and where such protection is available.
 
We seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring all employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to commit to confidentiality, non-disclosure and work-for-hire agreements. All of our employees are required to sign confidentiality and non-use agreements, which provide that any rights they may have in copyrightable works or patentable technologies accrue to us. Before entering into discussions with potential vendors and partners about our business and technologies, we require them to enter into a non-disclosure agreement. If these discussions result in a license or other business relationship, we also generally require that the agreement containing the parties’ rights and obligations include provisions for the protection of its intellectual property rights.

Customers
 
Within the Ting segment, customers are a very broad mix of consumers, small businesses and corporations seeking high-speed Internet Services. Wavelo offers services to a small number of CSPs focused in the U.S. along with their biggest external customer being DISH and internal customer being Ting, until such time we expand these offerings to other MVNOs or MNOs. The majority of the customers to whom we provide services as Tucows Domains are generally either web hosts or ISPs. A small number of customers are consultants and designers providing our services to their business clients, or retail consumers registering a personal domain name.
 
No customer represented more than 10% of our consolidated revenues in any of the last three fiscal years.
 
While our customers are capitalizing on the growth in Internet usage and the demand for new services, they also face significant competition from numerous other service providers with competitive or comparable offerings. This has led customers within our Wavelo and Tucows Domains segments to focus on core competencies, and increasingly seeking to outsource non-core services. Outsourcing enables these customers to better focus on customer acquisition and retention efforts by eliminating the need to own, develop and support non-core applications in-house. In the case of Tucows Domains, this supports our Value-Added Services offerings, and for Wavelo this supports our go-to-market efforts to offer full-service platforms providing a variety of solutions that support CSPs, including subscription and billing management, network orchestration and provisioning, and individual developer tools.
 
Seasonality
 
During the summer months and certain other times of the year, such as major holidays, Internet usage often declines. As a result, some of our services (such as OpenSRS, eNom, Ascio, and Hover) may experience reduced demand during these times. For example, our experience shows that new domain registrations decline during the summer months and around the year-end holidays. In addition, the first quarter of the fiscal year will often see higher billed revenues in regard to domain names due to most renewals occurring on January 1. The demand for Ting and Wavelo services is not impacted by seasonality. However, in certain Ting markets we operate in, construction activities associated with adding new serviceable addresses can be impacted by seasonal climate.
Competition
 
Our competitors may be divided into the following groups:
 

Ting 
--------------
• | U.S. Broadband providers such as AT&T, Comcast, Verizon and CenturyLink, who primarily compete with Ting Internet Services. 
Tucows Domains
• | Retail-oriented domain registrars, such as GoDaddy and Web.com, who compete with our Reseller customers in wholesale domain services and with Hover.
• | Wholesale-oriented domain registrars, such as GoDaddy, who market services to resellers such as our customers. 
• | Wholesale Email Service providers, such as Google, Microsoft, Bluetie and MailTrust. 


Wavelo
------
• | Traditional BSS/OSS providers such as Amdocs, Netcracker, Ericsson, Optiva and Sonar Software, who primarily compete with Wavelo’s platforms and services.

 
We expect to continue to experience significant competition from the competitors identified above and, as our business continues to develop, we expect to encounter competition from other providers. Service providers, Internet portals, web hosting companies, email hosting companies, outsourced application companies, country code registries and major telecommunication firms may broaden their services to include services we offer.
 
We believe the primary competitive factors in Ting are:
 

• | Providing a superior customer service experience; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Providing a simple and friendly user experience through more usable web and application interfaces and more fair and transparent pricing;
• | Being agnostic on internet hardware, including network routers; and 
• | Providing superior technology, speed and reliability with fiber to the home services. 

 
We believe the primary competitive factors in Tucows Domains are:
 

• | Providing superior customer service by anticipating the technical requirements and business objectives of resellers and providing them with technical advice to help them understand how our services can be customized to meet their particular needs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    5 

  


• | Providing cost savings over in-house solutions by relieving resellers of the expense of acquiring and maintaining hardware and software and the associated administrative burden; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Enabling resellers to better manage their relationships with their end-users; 
• | Facilitating scalability through an infrastructure designed to support millions of transactions across millions of end-users; and 
• | Providing superior technology and infrastructure, consisting of industry-leading software and hardware that allow resellers to provide these services to their customers without having to make substantial investments in their own software or hardware.

 
We believe the primary competitive factors in Wavelo are:
 

• | Event-based architecture is the foundation to our modern platforms, which means less network bandwidth consumption and less central processing unit ("CPU") utilization, cutting costs and speeding up delivery, enabling new features, functionality and better customer experiences; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Wavelo's product suite can transform CSPs from top to bottom. Our product suite is modular by nature, so our platforms can work just as well together as they do independently, and alongside other best-in-class software - to fill specific gaps in operations, network provisioning, subscriber management, or anything in between; and
• | CSPs are able to select the best of breed software and use it where they please, versus being forced into a traditional BSS/OSS software stack that forces them to use that providers' version of software to have full functionality. 

 

Although we encounter pricing pressure in many markets in which we compete, we believe the effects of that pressure are mitigated by the fact that we deliver a high degree of value to our customers through our business and technical practices. We believe our status as a trusted supplier also allows us to mitigate the effects of this type of competition. We believe that the long-term relationships we have made with many customers results in a sense of certainty that would not be available to those customers through a competitor.
 
Human Capital Resources
 
Employee Profile
 
At Tucows, we strive to maintain a best-in-class workplace where our employees can proudly bring their whole selves to work. We believe that by creating an intentional, inclusive culture, our people have more opportunities to thrive every day. 
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 1,020 full-time employees and 80 contracted employees globally. As a global Internet and technology company, we have a wide range of employees, including management professionals, technicians, engineers, and call center employees. None of our employees are currently represented by a labor union. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. Approximately 55% of our employees are based in Canada, followed by 35% based in the U.S., and the remaining 10% are spread across countries in Europe and other regions. Of our employees, approximately 450 support our Ting segment, 180 support our Wavelo segment, and approximately 260 support our Tucows Domains segment. The remaining 210 employees support corporate functions and shared technology services used across the Tucows group. 
 
We offer competitive compensation in addition to employee stock options, physical and mental health benefits, learning allowances, future planning programs for employee Registered Retirement Savings Plans ("RRSP/401k") contributions, as well as generous vacation, maternity, paternity and adoption leaves for our employees.
 
As an organization, Tucows is proud to foster a flexible, remote-first work environment that empowers employees to find a work style that fits their individual circumstances. Some employees perform work in other environments, including fulfillment centers, customers’ homes or businesses to perform service installation, and in the field to build out our network facilities. 
 
As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have established a Fiber Internet install solution for our employees and customers that minimizes risks associated with person-to-person contact. We have also implemented a vaccination policy requiring those employees who work from a Company office, meet in person with customers or travel by plane or train for business purposes to be fully vaccinated.
 
Employee Wellness
 
Tucows has introduced a series of initiatives that prioritize the mental and personal well-being of our employees and destigmatize mental health conversations at work. These initiatives include daily mindfulness sessions open to all employees, as well as company-wide memberships to mindfulness tools that allow employees to prioritize their well-being whenever they need. 
 
The Company also supports eight Employee Resource Groups ("ERGs") focused on 2SLGBTQ+, caregivers, women leadership, Canadian newcomers, neurodiversity, BIPOC, mental health and racial justice and equality. These volunteer groups connect employees with shared characteristics, life experiences and enable them to engage in activities that advance our culture and contribute to our success.
 
Diversity and Inclusion
 
As an organization, Tucows believes in the importance of driving meaningful change and impact; from its products to its people, everything is approached with intentionality. Our people philosophy is no different. To us, inclusion is not a standalone effort; it is intrinsically part of our employee experience, which helps us create a space where our team can proudly and comfortably bring their full selves to work. This principle is found throughout the entire company, and is especially apparent in Tucows’ benchmark-free people philosophy. The Company has invested in resources that build community and foster inclusivity within the organization.

Cybersecurity
 
Our industry is vulnerable to cybersecurity risks that are growing in both frequency and complexity. Tucows, along with our suppliers, employs systems and network infrastructure that are subject to cyberattacks, which may include theft of assets, unauthorized access to proprietary or sensitive information, destruction or corruption of data, ransomware attacks, or operational disruption. A significant cyberattack against our, or our suppliers’, critical network infrastructure and supporting information systems could result in service disruptions, litigation, loss of customers, incurring significant costs, and/or reputational damage.
 
Our Board of Directors (the "Board") has primary oversight responsibility for all aspects of operational risk including cybersecurity. As part of its oversight role, the Board regularly reviews management’s risk assessments as well as plans to prevent, detect and respond to ongoing security threats. Our ongoing success depends on protecting our sensitive data, including personal information about our customers and employees. We rely on security awareness training, policies, procedures and IT systems to protect this information.
 
Compliance with Government Regulations 
 
Ting
 
Our Fiber Internet services are also subject to a number of regulations and commitments. The Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") frequently considers imposing new broadband-related regulations such as those relating to an Open Internet. States and localities also consider new broadband-related regulations, including those regarding government-owned broadband networks, net neutrality and connectivity during COVID-19. Additionally, as an ISP, we must implement certain network capabilities to assist law enforcement in conducting surveillance of persons suspected of criminal activity. From time to time, the FCC considers imposing new regulatory obligations on ISPs. We are committed to an Open Internet and do not block, throttle or engage in paid or affiliated prioritization, and have committed not to block, throttle or discriminate against lawful content. 
Tucows Corporate - Mobile Services 
 
The FCC and other federal, state and local, as well as international, governmental authorities have jurisdiction over our business. The licensing, construction, operation, sale and interconnection arrangements of wireless telecommunications systems are regulated by the FCC and, depending on the jurisdiction, international, state and local regulatory agencies. In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensees, the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how the services may be offered, and resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands.
Wavelo
 
Our Wavelo Segment is less subject to government regulations and commitments because it enables subscription and billing management, network orchestration and provisioning, and individual developer tools. Outside of General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which creates obligations around the procurement, processing, publication and sharing of personal data, there is limited regulation or commitment to government bodies for software. 
 
Tucows Domains
 
Our Tucows Domains segment is subject to regulation ICANN, federal and state laws in the U.S. and the laws of other jurisdictions in which we do business. These include:
ICANN: The registration of domain names is governed by ICANN. ICANN is a multi-stakeholder private sector, not-for-profit corporation formed for the express purposes of overseeing a number of Internet related tasks, including management of the DNS, allocation of IP addresses, accreditation of domain name registrars and registries and the definition and coordination of policy development for all of these functions. Tucows, eNom, EPAG and Ascio are each individually accredited by ICANN as domain name registrars and thus our ability to offer domain name registration products is subject to our ongoing relationship with, and accreditation by, ICANN. 
Country Code Top-Level Domain ("ccTLD") Authorities: The regulation of ccTLDs is governed by national regulatory agencies of the country underlying the specific ccTLDs, such as Canada (.ca). Our ability to sell ccTLDs is dependent on our ability to maintain accreditation in good standing with these various international authorities.
Communications Decency Act ("CDA"): The CDA generally protects online service providers, such as Tucows, from liability for certain activities of their customers, such as posting of defamatory or obscene content, unless the online service provider is participating in the unlawful conduct. Notwithstanding the general protections from liability under the CDA, we may nonetheless be forced to defend ourselves from claims of liability covered by the CDA, resulting in an increased cost of doing business.
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”): The DMCA provides recourse for owners of copyrighted material who believe that their rights under U.S. copyright law have been infringed on the Internet. Under the DMCA, we generally are not liable for infringing content posted by third parties. However, if we receive a proper notice from a copyright owner alleging infringement of its protected works by web pages for which we provide hosting services, and we fail to expeditiously remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material, fail to post and enforce a digital rights management policy or a policy to terminate accounts of repeat infringers, or otherwise fail to meet the requirements of the safe harbor under the DMCA, the owner may seek to impose liability on us.
General Data Protection Regulation: GDPR creates obligations around the procurement, processing, publication and sharing of personal data. Potential fines for violations of certain provisions of GDPR reach as high as 4% of a company’s annual total revenue, potentially including the revenue of its international affiliates. The solutions we develop for GDPR-compliance may not be adequate in the views of regulatory authorities or ICANN, which may cause the loss of WHOIS privacy revenue or increase our costs of developing compliant solutions or subject us to litigation, liability, civil penalties, or loss of market share. As the privacy laws and regulations around the world continue to evolve, these changes could adversely affect our business operations in similar ways.
 
    7 

  

Several bodies of law may be deemed to apply to us with respect to various customer activities. Because we operate in a relatively new and rapidly evolving industry and since our industry is characterized by rapid changes in technology and in new and growing illegal activity, these bodies of laws are constantly evolving. As a host of content through our Exact Hosting business, and to a lesser extent as a registrar of domain names services we may be subject to potential liability for illegal activities by our resellers’ customers on their websites. We provide an automated service that enables users to register domain names. We do not monitor or review, nor does our accreditation agreement with ICANN require that we monitor or review, the appropriateness of the domain names we register for our customers or the content of their websites, and we have no control over the activities in which these customers engage. While we have policies in place to terminate domain names or to take other action if presented with evidence of illegal conduct, customers could nonetheless engage in prohibited activities without our knowledge.
