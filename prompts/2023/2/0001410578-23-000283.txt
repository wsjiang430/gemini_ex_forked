Item 1. Business
Historical background
Target Group Inc. (“Target Group” or “the Company”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 2, 2013, under our original name of River Run Acquisition Corporation. Effective May 13, 2014, the Company changed its name to Chess Supersite Corporation. On July 3, 2018, we filed an amendment in our Certificate of Incorporation to change our name to Target Group Inc.
Effective October 18, 2018, our common stock became eligible for quotation on the OTCQB platform operated by OTC Markets Group Inc, under the symbol “CBDY”.
The global spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) continued to have a significant impact on the Canadian and global economy and customer purchasing behavior, while equity markets remained volatile. However, these factors have not impacted the Company’s operations, financial results for the year.
Cannabis Business-Canada
We are now engaged in the cultivation, processing and distribution of curated cannabis products for the adult-use medical and recreational cannabis market in Canada and, where legalized by state legislation, in the United States. We believe that there is a shift in the public’s perception of cannabis from a state of prohibition to a state of legalization. In October 2018, Canada became the first major industrialized nation to legalize adult-use cannabis at the national federal level. Cannabis is still heavily regulated. However, the medical use of cannabis is now permitted in up to 29 countries and many more countries have reformed, or are considering reforming, their cannabis uses laws to include the recreational use of cannabis.
In the 2016 publication by Deloitte, Insights and Opportunities Recreational Marijuana, the project size of the Canadian adult-use market ranged from CDN$4.9 billion to CDN$8.7 billion annually. In the 2018 publication by Deloitte, A Society in Transition, an Industry Ready to Boom, the projected size of the Canadian adult-use market in 2019 ranged from CDN$1.8 billion to CDN$4.3 billion. The Canadian medical cannabis industry experienced substantial growth since 2014. Health Canada projects the Canadian cannabis market will reach CDN$1.3 billion in annual value by 2024.
We intend to position ourselves with a core emphasis on wholesale & co-packaging services to accommodate all consumer-packaged goods required for the sophisticated cannabis market in Canada and internationally. This will integrate cannabinoid research, analytical testing, product development and manufacturing.
Our product manufacturing will include, but will not be limited to the following:
●Cannabis flower pods for vaporizer use
●Cannabis extract pods for vaporizer use
●Cannabis pre-rolls
●K-Cup infused coffee and tea pods
●Infused cannabis beverages
●Infused cannabis edibles
●Infused topical products and CBD wellness products.

As of the date of this report, the Company (i.e., Target Group Inc. and its subsidiaries) does not have any operations, employees or corporate offices based in United States.
Acquisitions
To take advantage of the opportunity resulting from the legalization of adult-use cannabis in Canada, we completed several strategic acquisitions and entered into several significant agreements as follows:
