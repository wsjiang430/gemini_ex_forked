Item 1. Business
Overview
SES AI Corporation (“we,” “us,” “SES” or the “Company”) is a global leader in the development and production of high-performance, Lithium-Metal (“Li-Metal”) rechargeable battery technologies for electric vehicles (“EVs”), electric vehicle take-off and landing (“eVTOL”) and other applications. SES Holdings Pte. Ltd., and Subsidiaries (“Old SES”) was founded in 2012, and our mission is to facilitate the widespread adoption of sustainable electric transportation, both on land and in air, by creating best-in-class, high energy density Li-Metal batteries centered around long-range performance and safety.
We have developed what we believe to be the world’s most advanced Li-Metal battery technology, and we have the management team in place to become a leading provider of batteries. Our third-party tested, differentiated battery technology has been designed to combine the high energy density of Li-Metal with the cost-effective, large-scale manufacturability of conventional Lithium-ion (“Li-ion”) batteries and will help to promote the transition from the global dependence on fossil fuel-based automotive vehicles to clean and efficient EVs.
We believe that our Li-Metal batteries demonstrate industry-leading energy density and performance and will:

● | deliver a lightweight and compact battery, and substantially reduce range anxiety of EV consumers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | provide fast-charge capability to charge the battery to 80% in less than 15 minutes, significantly reducing charging times;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | incorporate advanced artificial intelligence (“AI”) software and battery management systems (“BMS”), which will accurately monitor the state of health of the battery and apply appropriate self-healing protocols;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | achieve rapid market adoption due to our strategic partnerships, including with leading global original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), such as General Motors (“GM”), Hyundai Motor Company (“Hyundai”), and Honda Motor Company, Ltd. (“Honda”);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | capitalize on the innovation occurring in Li-ion, including improvements in energy density, manufacturing efficiency and cost reduction, as our manufacturing processes are similar to Li-ion.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limitations of Current Battery Technology
Conventional Li-ion technology is currently being used in most commercially available EVs. Li-ion typically uses a metal oxide-based or phosphate-based cathode and graphite or graphite/silicon-based anodes. The anode and cathode are separated by a polymer-based separator. Finally, the whole cell is filled with a liquid electrolyte that conducts lithium ions from the anode to the cathode as the vehicle is being driven (or battery is being discharged), and from the cathode to the anode as the vehicle (or the battery) is being charged. Conventional Li-ion cells have been instrumental in kick starting the current EV market, and are being manufactured at scale at capacities of hundreds of GWh today. However, the automotive industry desires a battery with higher energy density to improve the electric driving range (the distance that a vehicle can be driven on a single charge) while reducing battery cost to enable mass-adoption.
Li-Metal Batteries
Li-Metal is widely considered and accepted as the EV battery technology capable of achieving the highest energy density. In fact, switching the current Li-ion graphite/silicon anode with Li-Metal will currently result in the highest possible energy density for any given cathode in lithium chemistry. Li-Metal is the lightest un-engineered pure metal on earth and since the lithium ions do not have to diffuse in and out of the anode host material (like in the case of graphite or silicon in conventional Li-ion), the battery cells made with Li-Metal anode can be very compact and light. This combination of a lightweight and compact anode results in the highest possible gravimetric (Watt-hour (“Wh”)/kg) and volumetric (Wh/liter) energy density, respectively, for any given cathode in lithium chemistry.
One approach to Li-Metal, known as “solid-state Li-Metal,” primarily relies on solid-state materials. The solid-state material refers to the phase (solid) within which lithium ions transport from anode to cathode (during discharge) or from cathode to anode (during charge). Conventional Li-ion technology uses liquid electrolytes (not solid electrolytes), and such lithium ion transport is in the liquid phase. Approaches that use solid electrolytes generally suffer from either not having sufficient conductivity at room and lower than room temperatures, poor interface between electrolyte and electrode, inability to suppress lithium dendrites when the solid electrolyte film is thin, and lack of demonstrated manufacturability of thin, large format films and multi-layer cells at scale.

Our Technology
SES’s approach to Li-Metal preserves the high energy density benefits of Li-Metal while utilizing a cell design that primarily uses a liquid electrolyte in the cathode and separator to transport the lithium ions. There is also a protective anode coating between the anode and the separator, which consists of solid-state electrolyte materials. Hence, we call our approach “Li-Metal,” as it utilizes both liquid and solid electrolyte in the cell simultaneously. This approach results not only in improved energy density due to using a Li-Metal anode, but also superior performance at room and lower than room temperatures, and enables manufacturing at scale just like Li-ion, which is manufactured at scale today. In fact, we have been successfully making multi-Amp-hour (“Ah”), multi-layer cells using our Li-Metal approach for many years.
The key breakthrough in SES’s Li-Metal cells is its proprietary and patented liquid electrolyte. This electrolyte is developed internally at SES with many years of scientific research and development. We use a high-concentration, solvent-in-salt electrolyte. While liquid electrolytes used in conventional Li-ion cells are volatile and flammable, SES’s liquid electrolyte has low volatility and is self-extinguishing. Conventional liquid electrolytes are primarily made up of organic solvents with low concentrations of salt to aid lithium ion conduction. SES’s liquid electrolyte primarily consists of salt with a very minute amount of proprietary solvent molecules. This new type of high-concentration solvent-in-salt liquid electrolyte is fundamentally different from conventional liquid electrolyte. It maintains the manufacturability advantage of liquid electrolytes in conventional Li-ion manufacturing, but can enable Li-Metal due to its stability on lithium metal.
SES’s Li-Metal technology also helps resolve an issue that has plagued Li-Metal adoption and progress for decades. With repeated charge and discharge cycles, lithium metal anodes are known to develop needle-like mossy structures known as dendrites, which can penetrate the separator and short-circuit the battery cell. The use of our liquid electrolyte changes the morphology of dendrite formation in our Li-Metal battery cells from needle-like mossy structures to a smooth lithium metal surface or dense deposition. Our proprietary anode coating provides an added layer of protection against separator penetration by making lithium plating denser during charging. Additionally, our advanced AI-powered safety software and BMS monitors the state-of-health of the battery cells and can accurately detect any safety issues much earlier. The combination of these elements significantly increases cell cycle life and safety.
The rest of the cell is assembled using our proprietary ultra-thin wide-width Li-Metal anode, a conventional state-of-the-art separator and a cathode. With the exception of the Li-Metal anode, all materials and components utilized in our battery cells are either already being manufactured at scale or have the capability to be easily manufactured at scale without the need for intensive research and development, or development of new equipment.
To our knowledge, SES Li-Metal battery cells are the only Li-Metal cells demonstrated to meet or exceed the preliminary OEM target requirements for energy density, low temperature discharge, room temperature fast charge and discharge, cycle life and safety.
Our unique high-energy density Li-Metal battery is expected to be:

● | light and compact, with high energy density of at least 400 Wh/kg and 1000 Wh/liter;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | durable and safe, with the ability to meet stringent cycle life, overall lifetime and safety targets for next generation EVs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | capable of fast charge, charging up to 80% in less than 15 minutes;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | capable of high power discharge, at room and low temperatures;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | low-cost, taking advantage of existing Li-ion manufacturing scale and best-practices to enable cost-reduction;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | capitalizing on the innovation occurring in Li-ion, in terms of incremental improvement in energy density, supply chain development, cost reduction and manufacturing efficiency, since the cathode and cell manufacturing process are the same as in Li-ion; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | smarter, with AI-powered safety software and BMS that can predict safety incidents in real time and make appropriate diagnostic recommendations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Competitive Strengths
Differentiated Battery Technology
As described above, our Li-Metal batteries are expected to be lighter, more energy dense, safer, faster-charging, and lower cost solution than Li-ion batteries, and to include smart technology. Our Li-Metal battery technology has projected energy density of 400 Wh/kg / 1,000 Wh/L in our large 100 Ah cells, compared to approximately 265 Wh/kg / 535 Wh/L in Li-ion battery cells using a high mickel content cathode. This higher energy density is expected to translate into significantly more range, which we believe will help to enable the expansion of an electrified world. Currently, our 100 Ah multi-layer battery cells have demonstrated energy density of 380 Wh/kg / 850 Wh/L in third-party testing, along with fast charging up to an 80% charge in less than 15 minutes, bolstering our confidence in our ability to achieve industry-leading performance. Our batteries are expected to be cheaper in the long-term, while providing fast-charge capabilities, best-in-class durability and a high degree of safety.
Designed For Manufacturing At Scale
Over the last 10 years of research and development, we have strived to develop a technology that is not only differentiated, but also scalable and manufacturable. We are producing our large 50 and 100 Ah cells using Li-ion production lines.
Strategic Partnerships
We believe that our products will experience swift market adoption due to our current strategic partnerships with leading global OEMs GM, Hyundai and Honda. To our knowledge, we are the only company working on Li-Metal technology that has entered into A-Sample joint development agreements (“JDAs”) with major OEMs for EVs. We plan to collaborate with other OEMs to expedite such adoption and increase market acceptance of our Li-Metal battery over time.
Our Growth Strategy
Battery Development for OEMs. We are currently working to develop and initially produce A-Sample batteries with specifications required by OEMs for their EVs, with the goal of achieving the development and initial production of B-Sample batteries in 2023 and C-Sample batteries in 2024, which we expect to enable us to commence commercial production of our technology in 2025. For more information on collaborations with these OEMs, see “Our Partnerships” below. A-Sample batteries are functional prototypes developed for OEMs based on their technical specifications. These are in contrast with B-Sample batteries, which are A-sample batteries manufactured under much higher throughput and tested in actual vehicles, and C-Sample batteries, which would be fully functional, mature samples for mass production and tested for full drivability in actual vehicles. As we remain focused on A-Sample battery development, we do not yet have any arrangements with OEMs to manufacture consumer-ready batteries for their EVs.
Battery Manufacturing At Scale. We will continue to enhance our production processes to enable volume manufacturing in a cost-effective manner. Phase I of our pilot facility in Shanghai was completed and ready-to-use in March 2022 and fully operational in the third quarter of 2022, and our pilot facility in South Korea was completed and ready-to-use in September 2022. We expect to expand our facilities in Shanghai and South Korea in 2023, and work with our OEM partners to build facilities for eventual C-Sample battery development and production ahead of this planned commercial production.
Partnership Development and Expansion. We will continue to strengthen our partnerships with GM, Hyundai and Honda in the use of our battery technology. Also, we intend to work closely with other OEMs and other strategic partners to develop and produce our Li-Metal battery cells, with the aim of making them widely available in EVs and other applications over time.
Supply Chain. As we plan to transition from A-sample to B-sample, we are exploring opportunities for partial vertical integration both upstream and downstream to ensure scalability. Vertical integration is used by Li-ion battery cell makers to reduce their costs, increase their competitiveness and streamline product development and commercialization for OEMs, by acquiring upstream and downstream participants in their supply chains. Upstream, we intend to explore integrating vendors of key materials of our cells and providers of key equipment and engineering capabilities, such as cell assembly, anode processing, chemical processing and safety testing. Downstream, we plan to explore integrating providers of key engineering capabilities, such as battery state-of-health monitoring software, charging optimization software, battery module development and recycling.
Continued Battery Innovation. We intend to continue leveraging our world-class science, engineering and manufacturing expertise to innovate future products that will continue to provide leading technology coupled with manufacturability. We continue to invest in research

and development in areas such as cell chemistry and structure, battery materials, AI software and advanced manufacturing, to build on our intellectual property portfolio.
Our Partnerships
We intend to work closely with OEMs and other strategic partners to develop and produce our Li-Metal battery cells, with the aim of making them widely available in EVs over time.
Existing JDAs
We have maintained a strong partnership with GM since 2015, when GM led our Series B financing, and since then, GM has invested approximately $70.0 million in our company, including a $50.0 million investment in our Series D funding round and a $10.0 million investment in the private placement transaction in connection with the Business Combination (the “PIPE Financing”), via GM’s affiliates and subsidiaries. GM is one of the world’s largest car companies, and has voiced its desire to be a leader in EVs. GM has announced plans to launch more than 30 new EV models by 2025 and only sell zero-emission vehicles by 2035. Our partnership initially involved close technical and research and development collaboration on SES’s battery technology. In February 2021, we entered into a JDA with GM, valued at over $50.0 million, under which we are collaborating to jointly develop an A-Sample battery cell with a capacity of almost 100 Ah.
We have also fostered a partnership with Hyundai, another global automobile leader and in December 2020, we entered into a pre-A-Sample JDA. In May 2021, Hyundai made an investment of $50.0 million in our Series D plus funding round and signed an A-Sample JDA, under which we are collaborating to jointly develop an A-Sample battery cell. We believe the Hyundai JDAs align our interests with those of Hyundai and will facilitate further collaboration in designing and developing our technology and products. Hyundai also purchased $50.0 million of our Class A common stock in the PIPE Financing.
In December 2021, Honda became the third global automobile leader to enter into an A-Sample JDA with us, under which we are collaborating to develop an A-Sample battery cell. Honda also purchased $75.0 million of our Class A common stock in the PIPE Financing as the single largest PIPE Financing investor.
The JDAs with GM, Hyundai and Honda do not represent commitments by these OEMs to purchase our Li-Metal battery cells, and are focused on development. Although the JDAs set timeframes for the attainment of certain development milestones, these timeframes are objectives only and may be subject to ongoing collaboration and change by the parties. The JDAs also do not prohibit GM, Hyundai, Honda or SES from entering into additional agreements with other third parties. To our knowledge, neither GM, Hyundai nor Honda has entered into new agreements with other automotive or battery companies for the development of A-Sample Li-Metal batteries.
Our Research and Development
We conduct research and development at our facilities in Woburn, Massachusetts in the United States, Shanghai, China, and Chungju, South Korea, and we expect to eventually build additional facilities in other parts of the world. Research and development activities concentrate on making further improvements to our battery technology, including improvements to battery performance and cost.
Major development efforts include, but are not limited to, programs in the following areas.

● | Scale-up: Our design is further being customized with and validated by several OEMs. Based on our collaborations with OEMs, we believe that a roughly 100 Ah cell-size manufactured at GWh scale (five to seven cells-per-minute) is needed to achieve commercialization in EVs at a large, global scale. We are developing processes and equipment to scale up the manufacturing of our current cell design from three to nine Ah capacity to 50 Ah and 100 Ah.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Module and Pack Design: Li-Metal cells must be integrated into modules and packs as part of their integration into vehicles. Our active development efforts are focused on the integration of our Li-Metal cells into modules to enable our Li-Metal cells to perform as intended once they are integrated into modules and vehicles.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Advanced AI Software and BMS: Software is critical to the ongoing monitoring of battery health and safety. We continue to develop advanced AI algorithms to diagnose battery cell-related health issues, develop advanced control algorithms and charging methods to enhance cycle life and safety, and port such software on to a BMS that can integrated into a battery pack.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Advanced Materials and Coatings: We continue to research and develop advanced electrolyte and anodes to further improve cycle life and safety. In addition, we continue to develop novel methods of laminating or depositing lithium metal onto current collector that can be deployed at commercial GWh scale.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cathode Materials and Design: We develop our Li-Metal cells for a variety of different cathode materials, cathode design and cathode processing methods that can provide ultra-high energy density and/or significant cost-reduction.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Li-Metal Recycling: Along with other battery components that are already being recycled today, Li-Metal foil will also need to be recycled in the future. We continue to explore methods of recycling that are productive and cost-effective.

10



Our prospective competitors include major manufactures supplying the industry, automotive OEMs and potential new entrants to the industry. Existing suppliers of batteries to the EV industry include Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited, SK Innovation, LG Energy Solutions, Panasonic Corporation and Samsung SDI. Although their offerings tend to be conventional Li-ion, they could develop Li-Metal batteries that would directly compete with our offerings. Additionally, many automotive OEMs, including Tesla, Nio, Rivian and Toyota, are researching and investing in efforts to develop their own EV battery production capabilities.
Newer entrants, including Northvolt, Sila Nanotechnologies, Solid Power, QuantumScape, Ganfeng Lithium and WeLion, are also seeking to improve conventional lithium-ion batteries or to develop new technologies, including lithium-metal and solid-state batteries, or to develop new technologies for cathodes, anodes, electrolytes and additives. Some of these companies have established relationships with automotive OEMs and are in varying stages of development.
We acknowledge that incumbents and emerging entrants may have greater resources to invest in advancing their technologies, access to more potential customers, or strategic relationships with OEMs (or other third parties) that may give them a competitive edge. We further acknowledge that these disparities, where they exist, have the potential to harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Government Regulation and Compliance
There are government regulations pertaining to battery safety, transportation of batteries, use of batteries in vehicles, factory safety and disposal of hazardous materials. We will ultimately have to comply with these regulations to sell our batteries into the market.
