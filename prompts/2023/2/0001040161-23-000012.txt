Item 1.Business.
Overview
Pixelworks is a leading provider of high-performance and power-efficient visual processing semiconductor and software solutions that enable consistently high-quality and authentic viewing experiences in a wide variety of applications. We define our primary target markets as Mobile (smartphone and tablet), Home & Enterprise (projectors, personal video recorders ("PVR"), and over-the-air ("OTA") streaming devices), and Cinema (creation, remastering, and delivery of digital video content). Previously we classified our primary target markets as Mobile, Projector, Video Delivery and Cinema, but have since aggregated the Projector and Video Delivery categories into one called "Home & Enterprise".
Pixelworks has been a pioneer in visual processing technology for over 20 years. We were one of the first companies to commercially launch a video System on Chip ("SoC") capable of deinterlacing 1080i HDTV signals and one of the first companies with a commercial dual-channel 1080i deinterlacer integrated circuit. We launched one of the industry’s first single-chip SoCs for digital projection. We were the first company to integrate motion estimation / motion compensation technology ("MEMC") as a mobile-optimized solution for smartphones. In 2019, we introduced our Hollywood award-winning TrueCut® video platform, the industry’s first motion grading technology that allows fine tuning of motion appearance in cinematic content. 
Our core visual processing technology intelligently processes digital images and video from a variety of sources and optimizes the content for a superior viewing experience. Rapid growth in video and gaming consumption, combined with the move towards bright, high resolution, high frame rate and high refresh rate displays, especially in mobile, is increasing the demand for our solutions. Our technologies can be applied across a wide range of applications: cinema theaters, low-power mobile tablets, smartphones, streaming devices, and digital projectors for the home, school, or the workplace. Our products are designed and optimized for power, cost, bandwidth, viewer experience, and overall system performance, according to the requirements of the specific application. On occasion, we have also licensed our technology. 
During the third quarter of 2021, we engaged in a strategic plan to re-align our Mobile and Home & Enterprise businesses to improve their focus on their Asia-centered customers and employee stakeholders. Our subsidiary, Pixelworks Semiconductor Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (or "PWSH"), now operates these businesses as a full profit-and-loss center underneath Pixelworks. In connection with this strategic plan, the Company and PWSH closed three separate financing transactions in 2021 and 2022, which are further described in "Note 14: Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest and Equity Interest of PWSH Sold to Employees", "Note 15: Non-Controlling Interest" and "Note 17: Subsequent Events", which are incorporated by reference into this section.
PWSH is in the process of preparing to file an application for an initial public offering of PWSH shares on the Shanghai Stock Exchange’s Science Technology Innovation Board, known as the STAR Market (the “Listing”). We believe that the Listing will have many benefits, including improved access to new capital markets and the funding of PWSH’s growth worldwide. We presently intend to qualify PWSH to apply for the Listing in 2023. The process of going public on the STAR Market is lengthy and includes several periods of review by various government agencies of the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”), such as the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the China Securities Regulatory Commission (“CSRC”). There is no guarantee that PWSH will be approved for a Listing at any point in the future. The listing of PWSH on the STAR Market will not change the status of PXLW as a U.S. public company. We are neither a PRC operating company nor do we conduct our operations in China through the use of variable interest entities.
Key Markets
We target three key markets with our products and services: Mobile, Home & Enterprise, and Cinema. 
Mobile
Our Mobile market category is composed of smartphones and tablets. The user experience with mobile video and gaming is a key driver of growth in the smartphone and tablet market. Smartphones and tablets pose a number of unique challenges as mobile display systems. Digital video content is available in a wide range of resolutions and frame rates. Power is of primary importance, impacting form factor, cost, and performance. As these systems have added more functionality, new features have had to compete for battery life, internal bandwidth, and space. The addition of high-resolution and high refresh rate displays has further increased the burden on these resources. The challenges of playing low resolution and frame rate content on a high resolution and frame rate display and of rendering high resolution and frame rate mobile games in a power-efficient way are limiting the users’ visual experience on mobile video and gaming. Our Mobile solutions are designed improve this user experience.
Using the same visual processing technology in a mobile device that was developed for large screen TVs is neither feasible nor desirable. The visual processing pipelines used in TVs consume many watts of power and would be unsuitable for battery powered systems. In TVs, the size constraints on electronics are significantly less stringent when compared to mobile systems. To furnish the Mobile market with appropriate solutions, we have taken a holistic, system-wide view and re-invented its visual processing technology to fit within the mobile constraints of battery life, bandwidth, form factor, performance, and use cases. This approach has enabled us to create technology that meets the power and size requirements of mobile as well as enabling low power but high frame rate, high resolution and high dynamic range video and gaming experiences.
The burgeoning global gaming market is dominated by the smartphone segment. The vast majority of gamers worldwide play games on a smartphone (June 2020 Ericsson Mobility Report). PC-grade AAA/Cinematic games are being deployed for smartphones. These games require more intensive visual processing, including higher frame rate, resolution, photorealistic, picture quality and responsiveness. Cost, size and power limit the rendering capabilities of mobile application processors, which are not keeping up with the sophistication of mobile games. Furthermore, battery life and thermal challenges remain difficult to overcome. Our visual processor solutions enable the most popular mobile games to achieve previously impossible visual experiences and battery life.
As 5G network coverage rapidly expands worldwide, the availability of 5G chipsets targeting smartphones should continue to reinvigorate market growth given the increased speed and lower latency of the wireless connections. In addition, service providers in some countries will also utilize 5G networks to provide fixed wireless broadband. We further believe our compelling Mobile visual processing functionality, combined with 5G capability, may help motivate consumers to replace their 3G and 4G phones at a faster rate than occurred in the past. Finally, a new smartphone category has emerged as top vendors have previewed foldable smartphones which serve as a phone, and a mini tablet when unfolded. As prices for this capability inevitably come down, and further competition emerges, we believe this new category, along with the rollout of 5G networks, can strengthen the Mobile device market.
Home & Enterprise
Our Home & Enterprise market category is composed of digital projection and video delivery devices and applications.
Digital Projection
Increasingly affordable price points are driving continued adoption of digital projectors in business and education, as well as among consumers. Technology improvements are helping to reduce the size and weight of projection devices while increasing their performance. Projector models range from larger units designed to be permanently installed in a conference hall or other venue to ultra-portable devices weighing fewer than two pounds for maximum portability. The feature set of projection systems differs from that of a typical large-screen flat panel display such as a TV. This is primarily because the projector is a sharing and collaboration device while the TV is designed for direct consumption of content.
The digital projection market serves several different areas such as business, education, and home theater. Business users employ multimedia projectors to display both still and video presentation materials from PCs and other sources. Requirements for the business market include portability, compatibility with multiple software and hardware applications, and features that ensure simple operation. In education environments ranging from elementary schools to university campuses, projectors help teachers integrate media-rich instruction into classrooms. Home theater projector systems can drive large-screen displays for content consumption where flat panel displays are either economically not viable or physically incompatible for use.
Consistent with the trends of other consumer products, digital projectors are increasingly incorporating networking capabilities that enable the sharing of video and other content among multiple devices. This, in turn, is enabling new use models for digital projection in both the education and business environments. For example, one teacher can present the same material simultaneously in multiple classrooms, and students in different classrooms can display and discuss their work. Such connectivity allows instant access to content and sharing of content, which promotes interaction and collaboration among dispersed groups. In the business setting, this connectivity enables teleconferencing and the seamless sharing of content for more effective meetings.
Video Delivery 
With the acquisition of ViXS Systems Inc. in August 2017, we expanded both our market presence and product portfolio. The video industry continues to evolve and adopt new video standards such as High Efficiency Video Coding, 4K Ultra HD and HDR. The technical and processing demands of these standards are complex and play directly into our core competencies. Our technologies for video delivery are highly integrated, low power, and provide high quality video processing, allowing seamless connectivity between devices while maintaining end-to-end content security. With the advent of digital video, it has become possible to deliver video to consumers in an ever-increasing number of ways. Traditional delivery mechanisms, such as over the air broadcasts, cable, satellite, DVDs, and Blu-ray, are being supplemented with Internet streaming and download services. With these new video delivery options comes the ability to offer more services and improved quality.
High-resolution (UHD/4K), sustained bitrate decoding (100Mbit), and advanced video formats (HDR10, HDR10+) are key requirements for advanced personal video recorder ("PVR") products sold in the Japanese market, where consumers rate video quality as a key acquisition criteria. The advanced PVR market in Japan is experiencing growth as products move from 2K to UHD/4K formats and support new broadcast technologies, like Advanced Digital Satellite Broadcast ("ADSB") in Japan.
Cinema
Our Cinema market category is composed of applications and services for content creation, remastering and video streaming for cinematic video. Our Cinematic solutions expand the creative palette for filmmakers, and ensure the correct presentation of creative intent across screens. In recent years, the trend towards brighter, high dynamic range ("HDR")-capable screens, larger screen sizes and higher resolutions, has amplified artifacts such as judder and strobing and caused the filmed shutter speed to appear faster and more choppy than intended. Furthermore, the mismatch between the 24 frame per second rate that is the standard for cinema and the higher screen refresh rates used on home entertainment screens creates additional artifacts, that all together degrade the viewing experience and are no longer faithful to creative intent. 
Our TrueCut Motion platform is the industry’s first solution to give filmmakers the ability to cinematically fine-tune motion blur, judder, and frame-rate appearance and can be used as part of the creative process to empower filmmakers to shoot at any frame-rate and then deliver a cinematically-tuned, broader set of motion and frame rate appearances. TrueCut technology preserves artistic intent across screens, from theaters to TVs to smartphones.

Technology
Evolution of Display Technology and The Performance Gap
Display technologies have recently begun to transition from an era of higher resolutions, response times, and frame rates, with lower power and thinner form factors, to one focused on higher contrast, brightness, and more colors.
In mobile devices, Apple Inc. ("Apple") has brought wide color gamut to many of their devices, including the iPhone, iPad Pro, MacBook Pro and iMac. These devices deliver the same color gamut used in digital cinema theaters ("DCI-P3"). Meanwhile, TV manufacturers including Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. ("Samsung"), TCL Technology, Sony Corporation ("Sony"), and LG Electronics, Inc. ("LG") are bringing high contrast, high brightness, or HDR TVs based on organic light emitting diodes ("OLED") and local-dimming liquid crystal display ("LCD") panels to the living room. Furthermore, most premium and high-tier smartphones and tablets from Apple, Samsung, Sony, LG, and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd now include HDR as a standard feature.
Hardware improvements in color and contrast are of little value without content that can take advantage of them. In fact, a significant gap now exists between the vast majority of video content available to consumers and these emerging display devices.
•Contrast and Brightness: Almost all movies available to consumers today use the "Rec.709" ITU standard format. This format defines brightness levels up to around 100 "nits" (a standard measure of brightness), whereas HDR TVs are five to ten times brighter, from 540 nits upwards. Most mobile devices support over 400 nits and sometimes over 1000 nits of peak brightness.
•Color Gamut: DCI-P3 has a 25% larger color gamut than Rec.709.
•Frame Rate: TVs commonly display at 120 frames per second (120 Hz) and up to 240 Hz on more sophisticated higher-end models. All premium tier mobile displays were launched in 2020 with 120 Hz screens, which are quickly cascading down to lower price points. Some of the gaming smartphones now have displays that run at up to 144 Hz. 
•Resolution: TVs have achieved 4k resolutions (3840x2160) and mobile devices today can achieve up to 1440x3240 resolution, and while some content is available in 4k resolution, most movies are only available in FHD or HD resolutions, which is typically 1920x1080 and 1280x720, respectively.
Content formats are evolving to take advantage of these display improvements. For example, Dolby Labrotories, Inc. ("Dolby") introduced the "Dolby Vision™" format for movies and devices, in order to allow consumers to realize the benefits of HDR and wide color gamut. The industry standards body Society of Motion Picture & Television Engineers released a format specification known as "HDR10" that similarly bridges the gap in contrast and color between content and devices. The Ultra-HD Blu-ray disk format and streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Video now support 4k HDR, aided by improved compression standards such as H.265.
Managing many content formats across a rapidly evolving range of displays is a significant and growing challenge. Older content tends to not get upgraded to the newer formats, yet consumers expect all content to display correctly. As the number of content formats grow, the technology of video processing becomes increasingly complex.
Delivering the intent of the content creator requires sophisticated algorithms and hardware circuits. Frame-rate and motion incompatibilities require a significantly higher level of processing and more sophisticated algorithms in order to avoid creating new problems. For example, Hollywood movies, TV shows, and other premium content are usually authored at 24 frames per second or 24 Hz. At this frame rate, the brain can easily notice the transition from one frame to the next. As the brain and eyes track objects in motion, they have to jump in discrete steps due to the low frame rate. This stop-start motion is perceived by the brain as judder, jitter or strobing, reducing the visible clarity and fidelity of objects in motion and distracting from the main subject of the content. Most TVs today include frame-rate conversion chips, but many reviewers complain about artifacts such as halos, breakup in the image and the so-called "soap opera effect". Unfortunately, without frame-rate conversion, the video can appear to have judder and blur at levels that have increased substantially as a result of the improvements in contrast, color and detail.
Additionally, when a motion sequence is played on a digital display device, the new updated frame is drawn over the top of the still visible previous frame. This "hold" effect is perceived by the brain as motion blur. There are numerous causes of motion blur. The materials used in constructing pixels on the display take a finite amount of time to transition from one state to another. If this time is too long, the image does not update swiftly and motion sequences seem to smear or blur. 
Judder and motion blur artifacts are more noticeable on bright, large screen, high contrast displays. Our advanced visual processing technology provides OEMs with solutions that avoid or minimize these artifacts and help realize the potential of their investment in high-resolution displays. 
This gap between display capabilities and available content brings significant challenges to video display device manufacturers. Sophisticated visual processing is required to accurately reproduce the intended video on today’s displays. We help bridge this gap between the display capabilities and available content with our visual processors and software, as well as with our TrueCut® Motion platform for content creators, distributors and display brands.
Our Technology: Bridging the Gap Between Device and Content While Preserving Creative Intent
Our core technologies are a portfolio of advanced video algorithms and intellectual property to address the many challenges posed by digital video. We believe our technologies can significantly improve video quality and will become increasingly important as the popularity of video content consumption grows, and pixel densities, screen size and image quality increase. Our products are designed with a flexible architecture that allows us to combine algorithms and functional blocks of digital and mixed signal circuitry. Accordingly, our technologies can be implemented across multiple products or in combinations within single products and can be applied to a broad range of applications, including smartphones, tablets, and projectors. The majority of our products include one or more of our technologies to provide optimal high-quality visual processing solutions to our customers, regardless of screen size.
Our core visual processing technologies include:
•MotionEngine® MEMC. Our proprietary MEMC technology significantly improves the performance and viewing experience of any screen by addressing problems such as judder and motion blur. Unlike competitive solutions it also reduces halo effects that are a typical byproduct of MEMC technology in general. Halos are objectionable blurred regions that surround moving objects as the MEMC algorithms try to reconstruct missing image data caused by the concealing and revealing of objects as they pass over or behind one another. Removing halos dramatically improves image quality and is of particular importance on high-resolution and bright displays where artifacts become more visible.
•AI Based Display Processing. This technology dramatically improves video and image quality and sets a new standard for picture quality on both LCD and OLED mobile displays with a new AI-driven architecture and dynamic refresh rate support for up to 144 Hz. Its lightweight AI display inferencing augments the Company’s knowledge base, numerous real time inputs, and fuzzy logic IP to adaptively and intelligently optimize overall picture quality for video, games, and photos at low power, including real time SDR-to-HDR conversion and AI adaptive display.
•Advanced Scaling. As display resolutions continue to increase, there is a need to convert lower resolution content to higher resolution in order to display content properly. With the latest wave of high-resolution displays, the quality and quantity demands of scaling have increased significantly. Artifacts become more noticeable on these types of displays as they distract from the realism effect. In addition, with the availability of high-resolution content lagging behind the availability of high-resolution displays, high-quality scaling is required to ensure these new high resolution displays (such as 4K) do not suffer when compared to lesser resolution displays of the same size. Our advanced scaling is designed to ensure that up-conversion of lower resolution content is of the highest quality in maintaining the fidelity of image.
•Mobile Visual Processing. We have developed innovative visual processing solutions that are designed to optimize power consumption for mobile devices. Beyond MEMC and advanced scaling, these mobile solutions provide the kind of improvements in color, contrast, sharpness, and de-blur that are currently only found in high quality TVs today. Furthermore, this technology can reduce system power consumption and extend battery life.
•Transcoding/Decoding. Digital Delivery forms the bulk of not just video content, but all internet bandwidth today. However, throughout the entire chain from inception to consumption, there are multiple variations in bitrate, resolution, and codecs used for both audio and video. Transcoding is a fundamental technology used throughout this pipeline that leads to moving pictures viewed on TVs and mobile devices. The XCODE family of ASICs has enabled many devices within this pipeline, from the racks in some service providers all the way down to the home user watching broadcast OTA TV on a smartphone. XCODE technology provides solutions that deliver UHD Blu-ray PVRs with capability of transcoding recorded content suitable for viewing on smartphones. The technology supports today’s broadcast standards, such as ATSC 1.0, DVB/T/T2/S/S2, ISDB/T/S, and ADSB and is scalable to support upcoming broadcast standards such as ATSC 3.0.
•SDR to HDR Conversion. UHD video has standardized on a technology known as HDR to deliver higher dynamic range content. This has resulted in several competing HDR deployments like HDR10, HLG and HDR10+ with support by multiple industry giants. Our HDR conversion technology can not only convert between SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) and HDR10, it can also convert among HDR10, HLG and HDR10+, solving an interconnectivity problem between content formatted in one HDR format and display devices that support a different HDR format. 
•Rendering Accelerator. We have developed technology that is enabled via a software development kit used by gaming content makers to allow their games to leverage the resources and features of our most current visual processing technology to improve the user experience with high frame rate, high resolution games while reducing overall system power consumption. 
•TrueCut Motion Grading and Pre-processing. Through our end-to-end platform, filmmakers determine the motion look and their creative intent at the source. Their creative intent is preserved through a certified distribution and playback platform all the way to the final presentation to viewers. This approach provides a closer relationship between the filmmaker and the viewer than has been previously possible.
Customers, Sales and Marketing
IC Products
The key focus of our global sales and marketing strategy for our IC products is to achieve design wins with industry leading branded manufacturers in our target markets and to continue building strong customer relationships. Once a design win has been achieved, sales and marketing efforts are focused on building long-term mutually beneficial business relationships with our customers by providing superior technology and reducing their costs, which complements our customers’ product development objectives and meets their expectations for price-performance and time to market. Marketing efforts are focused on building market-leading brand awareness and preference for our solutions.
We utilize direct sales and marketing resources in Japan, China, Europe and Taiwan. In addition to sales and marketing representatives, we have field application engineers who provide technical expertise and assistance to manufacturing customers on final product development.
Our global distribution channel is multi-tiered and involves both indirect and direct distribution channels.
Indirect Distribution Channels
•We have indirect distribution relationships through our distributors. Distributors are resellers in local markets who provide engineering support and stock our semiconductors in direct relation to specific manufacturing customer orders. Our distributors often have valuable and established relationships with our end customers, and in certain countries it is customary to sell to distributors. While a distributor's payment to us is not dependent upon the distributor’s ability to resell the product or to collect from the end customer, our distributors may provide longer payment terms to end customers than those we would offer. Sales to distributors accounted for 57% and 56% of revenue in 2022 and 2021 respectively.
One of our distributors, Tokyo Electron Device Ltd. represented more than 10% of revenue in each of 2022 and 2021, and accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022. Another distributor, Upstar Technology Limited accounted for more than 10% of revenue in 2022 and 2021 and accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. No other distributor accounted for more than 10% of revenue in 2022 and 2021 or represented more than 10% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022 or 2021. 
Direct Distribution Channels
We have direct distributor relationships in Japan, China, Europe and Taiwan.
•We have established direct relationships with companies that manufacture high-end display systems. Revenue through direct relationships accounted for 43% and 44% of total revenue in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
We have direct relationships with companies falling into the following three classifications:
•Integrators. Integrators are OEMs who build display devices based on specifications provided by branded suppliers.
•Branded Manufacturers. Branded manufacturers are globally recognized manufacturers who develop display device specifications and manufacture, market and distribute display devices either directly or through resellers to end-users.
•Branded Suppliers. Branded suppliers are globally recognized suppliers who develop display device specifications and then source them from integrators, typically in Asia, and distribute them either directly or through resellers to end-users.
End Customers
Revenue attributable to our top five end customers together represented 76% of revenue in both 2022 and 2021. End customers include customers who purchase directly from us as well as customers who purchase products indirectly through distributors. Sales to Seiko Epson Corporation represented more than 10% of revenue in each of 2022 and 2021, and accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Sales to vivo Communication Technology Co. Ltd. represented more than 10% of revenue in each of 2022 and 2021. Sales to Guangdong OPPO Mobile Telecommunications Corporation, Ltd. accounted for more than 10% of revenue in 2022. No other end customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue in 2022 or 2021 or represented more than 10% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022 or 2021.
TrueCut Products
The sales and marketing of our TrueCut products differs in approach from that of our IC products. The TrueCut platform includes a mix of services and licensing that is targeted at all levels of the creation, finishing, and distribution of cinematic or streaming digital video. For our TrueCut Motion content creation tools we seek to work directly with filmmakers, providing motion grading services, or the tools are also available for license. For content finishing, specific to certain displays, TrueCut Motion will pre-process the content in order to ensure playback according to the original creative intent. For display makers and brands, we provide the certification services, support, and IP licensing necessary to play back TrueCut Motion processed content, and the right to use the TrueCut Motion brand. We do not use distributors for our TrueCut products. Revenue from our TrueCut products is thus far not material, and therefore we include all such revenue in our Engineering services, license and other category for the Mobile market.
Seasonality
Our business is subject to seasonality related to the markets we serve and the location of our customers. For example, we have historically experienced higher revenue from the digital projector component of the Home & Enterprise market in the third quarter of the year, and lower revenue in the first quarter of the year, as our Japanese customers reduce inventories in anticipation of their March 31 fiscal year end. 
Geographic Distribution of Sales
Sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 95% and 97% of revenue in 2022 and 2021 respectively.
Financial information regarding our domestic and foreign operations is presented in "Note 13. Segment Information" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Backlog
Our sales are made pursuant to customer purchase orders for delivery of standard products. The volume of product actually purchased by our customers, as well as shipment schedules, are subject to frequent revisions that reflect changes in both the customers’ needs and product availability. In light of industry practice and our own experience, we do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results.
Competition
The vast majority of our revenue is derived from sales of integrated circuits within the intensely competitive semiconductor industry. Further, the markets for higher performance display and projection devices, including the markets for mobile devices, digital projectors and other applications demanding high quality video, are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, compressed product life cycles and declining average selling prices. We believe the principal competitive factors in our markets include product performance, time to market, cost, functional versatility provided by software, customer relationships and reputation, patented innovative designs, levels of product integration, compliance with industry standards and system design cost. We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors. 
Our current products face competition from developers of application processors and specialized display controllers designed by merchant chip vendors, our customers, potential customers and display panel vendors. Additionally, new alternative display processing technologies and industry standards may emerge that compete with technologies we offer.
We also compete with specialized and diversified electronics and semiconductor companies that offer display processors or scaling components including: Actions Microelectronics Co., Ltd., ARM Holdings PLC, Dolby Laboratories, Inc., Egis Technology Inc., Hisilicon Technologies Co., Ltd., i-Chips Technology Inc., Lattice Semiconductor Corporation, MediaTek Inc., Novatek Microelectronics Corp., NVIDIA Corporation, Qualcomm Incorporated, Realtek Semiconductor Corp., Renesas Electronics America Inc., Socionext Inc., Solomon Systech (International) Ltd., STMicroelectronics N.V., Sunplus Technology Co., Ltd., Synaptics Incorporated, Texas Instruments Incorporated, Unisoc Communications, Inc., and other companies. Potential and current competitors may include diversified semiconductor manufacturers and the semiconductor divisions or affiliates of some of our customers, including: Apple Inc., Broadcom Inc., LG Electronics, Inc., MegaChips Corporation, Mitsubishi Digital Electronics America, Inc., NEC Corporation, Panasonic Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Socionext Inc., ON Semiconductor Corporation, Seiko Epson Corporation, Sharp Electronics Corporation, Sony Corporation, and Toshiba America, Inc. In addition, start-up companies may seek to compete in our markets.
Although TrueCut Motion is the first motion grading solution for the cinematic market, competitive solutions could arise rapidly. These competitive solutions could come from several sources, including companies that provide solutions for other post-processing needs (such as Dolby Laboratories, Inc., Epic Games, Inc., Unity Technologies, Adobe, Inc., Soluciones Gráficas por Ordenador S.L. (SGO), The Foundry Visionmongers Limited, and Autodesk, Inc.) as well as visual effects studios that use digital effects to reduce artifacts before they are created (such as Wētā FX, DNEG Plc, Pixar Animation Studios, Digital Domain, and Industrial Light & Magic (ILM)). We believe that we would compete favorably with respect to these potential competitive solutions and services in terms of cost, price, functionality, efficiency, patented methods, and time to market. 
Research and Development
Research and development efforts are focused on the development of our solutions for the Mobile, Home & Enterprise and Cinema markets. Our development efforts are focused on pursuing higher levels of video performance, integration and new features in order to provide our customers with solutions that enable them to introduce market leading products and help lower final systems costs.
We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources in research and development activities. Our research and development expenses were $30.5 million and $27.3 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. During 2022 and 2021, we received reimbursements related to a co-development arrangement with a customer for costs incurred in connection with our development of an IC product. As a result of the reimbursements, our overall research and development expense was reduced by $4.3 million and $4.0 million in 2022 and 2021 respectively.
Manufacturing
Within the semiconductor industry we are known as a "fabless" company, meaning that we do not manufacture the semiconductors that we design and develop, but instead contract with a limited number of foundries and assembly and test vendors to produce all of our wafers and for completion of finished products. The fabless approach allows us to concentrate our resources on product design and development where we believe we have greater competitive advantages.
See "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on risks related to our manufacturing strategy and processes.
Our TrueCut products do not require manufacturing, since they are based on IP, software, and services.    
Intellectual Property
We use a combination of nondisclosure agreements and patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to protect the algorithms, design and architecture of our technology. As of December 31, 2022, we held 291 patents and have 17 patent applications pending, compared to 335 patents and 9 patent applications pending as of December 31, 2021. The patents we hold relate generally to improvements in the visual display of digital image data including, but not limited to, improvements in image scaling, image correction, automatic image optimization and video signal processing for digital displays, and in large part, are implemented in our core technologies and products. Our U.S. and foreign patents are generally enforceable for 20 years from the date they were filed. Accordingly, our issued patents have from approximately 1 to 16 years remaining in their respective term, depending on their filing dates. We believe that the remaining term of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our related products.
We intend to seek patent protection for other significant technologies that we have already developed and expect to seek patent protection for future products and technologies as necessary. Patents may not be issued as a result of any pending applications and any claims allowed under issued patents may be insufficiently broad to protect our technology. Existing or future patents may be invalidated, diluted, circumvented, challenged or licensed to others. Furthermore, the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or intellectual property rights in the same manner and to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. and, thus, make the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely in these countries.
The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection of intellectual property rights, which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation. We, our customers or our foundries from time to time may be notified of claims that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties. Litigation by or against us relating to patent infringement or other intellectual property matters could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation results in a determination favorable to us. In the event of an adverse result in any such litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacture, use and sale of infringing products, expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain licenses to the infringing technology. We may not be able to settle any alleged patent infringement claim through a cross-licensing arrangement. In the event any third party made a valid claim against us, our customers or our foundries, and a license was not made available to us on terms that are acceptable to us or at all, we would be adversely affected.
See "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A, and "Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on various risks related to intellectual property.
Environmental Matters
Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations and we may incur additional capital expenditures and asset impairments to ensure that our products and our vendors’ products are in compliance with these regulations. We would be subject to significant penalties for failure to comply with these laws and regulations.
See "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on various environmental risks.
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 222 employees, the majority of which were full-time, compared to 217 employees as of December 31, 2021.
