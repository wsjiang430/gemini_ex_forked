Item 1. Business
General
Hudson Technologies, Inc. (“Hudson” or the “Company”), incorporated under the laws of New York on January 11, 1991, is a refrigerant services company providing innovative solutions to recurring problems within the refrigeration industry. Hudson has proven, reliable programs that meet customer refrigerant needs by providing environmentally sustainable solutions from initial sale of refrigerant gas through recovery, reclamation and reuse, peak operating performance of equipment through energy efficiency and emergency air conditioning and refrigeration system repair, to final refrigerant disposal and carbon credit trading.
The Company’s operations consist of one reportable segment. The Company’s products and services are primarily used in commercial air conditioning, industrial processing and refrigeration systems, and include refrigerant and industrial gas sales, refrigerant management services consisting primarily of reclamation of refrigerants and RefrigerantSide® Services performed at a customer’s site. RefrigerantSide® Services consists of system decontamination to remove moisture, oils and other contaminants intended to restore systems to designed capacity. In addition, the Company’s SmartEnergy OPS® service is a web-based real time continuous monitoring service applicable to a facility’s refrigeration systems and other energy systems. The Company’s Chiller Chemistry® and Chill Smart® services are also predictive and diagnostic service offerings. As a component of the Company’s products and services, the Company also participates in the generation of carbon offset projects. The Company operates principally through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Hudson Technologies Company. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to the “Company”, “Hudson”, “we”, “us”, “our”, or similar pronouns refer to Hudson Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
The Company’s executive offices are located at 300 Tice Boulevard, Suite 290, Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey and its telephone number is (845) 735-6000. The Company maintains a website at www.hudsontech.com, the contents of which are not incorporated into this filing.
Industry Background
The Company participates in an industry that is highly regulated, and changes in the regulations affecting our business could affect our operating results. Currently the Company purchases virgin hydrofluoro-olefin (“HFO”) and hydrofluorocarbon (“HFC”) refrigerants and reclaimable, primarily hydrochlorofluorocarbon (“HCFC”), HFC and chlorofluorocarbon (“CFC”) refrigerants from suppliers and its customers. Effective January 1, 1996, the Clean Air Act, as amended (the “Act”) prohibited the production of virgin CFC refrigerants and limited the production of virgin HCFC refrigerants. Effective January 2004, the Act further limited the production of virgin HCFC refrigerants and federal regulations were enacted which established production and consumption allowances for HCFC refrigerants and which imposed limitations on the importation of certain virgin HCFC refrigerants. Under the Act, production of certain virgin HCFC refrigerants was phased out on December 31, 2019 and production of all virgin HCFC refrigerants is scheduled to be phased out by 2030.
The Act, and the federal regulations enacted under authority of the Act, have mandated and/or promoted responsible use practices in the air conditioning and refrigeration industry, which are intended to minimize the release of refrigerants into the atmosphere and encourage the recovery and re-use of refrigerants. The Act prohibits the venting of CFC, HFC and HCFC refrigerants, and prohibits and/or phases down the production of CFC and HCFC refrigerants.
The Act also mandates the recovery of CFC and HCFC refrigerants and promotes and encourages re-use and reclamation of CFC and HCFC refrigerants. Under the Act, owners, operators and companies servicing cooling equipment utilizing CFC and HCFC refrigerants are responsible for the integrity of the systems regardless of the refrigerant being used. In November 2016, the EPA issued a final rule extending these requirements to HFCs and to certain other refrigerants that are approved by the EPA as alternatives for CFC and HCFC refrigerants (the “608 Rule”).

HFC refrigerants are used as substitutes for CFC and HCFC refrigerants in certain applications. As a result of the increasing restrictions and limitations on the production and use of CFC and HCFC refrigerants, various sectors of the air conditioning and refrigeration industry have been replacing or modifying equipment that utilize CFC and HCFC refrigerants and have been transitioning to equipment that utilize HFC or HFO refrigerants. Certain HFC refrigerants are highly weighted greenhouse gases that are believed to contribute to global warming and climate change and, as a result, are now subject to various state regulations relating to the sale, use and emissions of HFC refrigerants, as well as federal restrictions on the production and consumption of HFCs (as set forth below). The Company expects that HFC refrigerants eventually will be replaced by HFOs or other types of products with lower global warming potentials.
In October 2016, more than 200 countries, including the United States, agreed to amend the Montreal Protocol to phase down production of HFCs by 85% by 2047. The amendment establishes timetables for all developed and developing countries to freeze and then reduce production and use of HFCs, with the first reductions by developed countries in 2019. The amendment became effective January 1, 2019 as more than 197 countries have ratified the amendment.
AIM Act
In December 2020, Congress enacted the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act of 2020 (the “AIM Act”) in the United States that will require the phasedown of virgin production and consumption of HFCs, which will also increase opportunities for reclamation of HFCs.
On September 23, 2021, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) issued the final rule establishing the framework to allocate allowances for virgin production and consumption of HFCs. The EPA is responsible for the administration of the HFC phase down enacted by Congress under the AIM Act.
The AIM Act directs the EPA to address the reduction in virgin HFCs and provides authority to do so in three respects:

1) | phase down the production and consumption of listed HFCs,
---+----------------------------------------------------------


2) | manage these HFCs and their substitutes, and
---+---------------------------------------------


3) | facilitate the transition to next-generation technologies.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------

Congress also required that EPA shall consider ways to promote reclamation in all phases of its implementation of the AIM Act. The final rule introduces a stepdown of 10% from baseline levels and a subsequent allowance rule must establish a cumulative 40% reduction in the baseline for 2024. Hudson received an allocation consumption allowance for calendar year 2022 and 2023 equal to approximately 3 million Metric Tons Exchange Value Equivalents, or 1% of the total HFC consumption. Reclamation will be critical to maintaining necessary HFC supply levels to ensure an orderly phasedown.
Products and Services
Sustainability
From its inception, the Company has sold refrigerants, and has provided refrigerant reclamation and refrigerant management services that are designed to recover and reuse refrigerants, thereby protecting the environment from release of refrigerants to the atmosphere and the corresponding ozone depletion and global warming impact and supporting the circular economy. The reclamation process allows the refrigerant to be re-used thereby eliminating the need to destroy or manufacture additional refrigerant and eliminating the corresponding impact to the environment associated with the destruction and manufacturing. The Company believes it is the largest refrigerant reclaimer in the United States. In addition, the Company participates in the creation and monetization of verified emission reductions utilizing third party protocols.
The Company provides a complete offering of refrigerant management services, which primarily include reclamation of refrigerants, laboratory testing through the Company’s laboratory, which has been certified by the Air Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute (“AHRI”), and banking (storage) services tailored to individual customer requirements. The Company also separates “crossed” (i.e. commingled) refrigerants and provides re-usable cylinder refurbishment and hydrostatic testing services.

The Company has also created alternative solutions to reactive and preventative maintenance procedures that are performed on commercial and industrial refrigeration systems. These services, known as RefrigerantSide® Services, reduce the system’s energy consumption and improve the system’s operating performance, and complement the Company’s refrigerant sales and refrigerant reclamation and management services. These services also preserve system refrigerant charges, reducing the need for manufacture of additional refrigerant.
Refrigerant and Industrial Gas Sales
The Company sells reclaimed and virgin (new) refrigerants to a variety of customers in the air conditioning and refrigeration industry. The Company continues to sell reclaimed CFC and certain HCFC based refrigerants, which are no longer manufactured. Virgin refrigerants are purchased by the Company from several suppliers and resold by the Company. Additionally, the Company regularly purchases used or contaminated refrigerants, from many different sources, which refrigerants are then reclaimed using the Company’s high speed proprietary reclamation equipment, its proprietary Zugibeast® system, and then are resold by the Company.
The Company also sells industrial gases to a variety of industry customers, predominantly to users in or involved with the US Military. In July 2016 the Company was awarded, as prime contractor, a five-year contract, together with a five-year renewal option which has been exercised in July 2021, by the United States Defense Logistics Agency (“DLA”) for the management, supply, and sale of refrigerants, compressed gases, cylinders and related services.
Carbon Offset Projects
CFC refrigerants are ozone depleting substances and are also highly weighted greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming and climate change. The destruction of CFC refrigerants may be eligible for verified emission reductions that can be converted and monetized into carbon offset credits, which then can be traded in the emerging carbon offset markets. The Company is pursuing opportunities to acquire CFC refrigerants and is developing relationships within the emerging environmental markets in order to implement opportunities for the creation and monetization of verified emission reductions from the destruction of CFC refrigerants.
In October 2015, the American Carbon Registry (“ACR”) established a methodology to provide, among other things, a quantification framework for the creation of carbon offset credits for the use of certified reclaimed HFC refrigerants. The Company is pursuing opportunities to acquire HFC refrigerants and is developing relationships within the emerging environmental markets in order to implement opportunities for the creation and monetization of verified emission reductions from the reclamation of HFC refrigerants.
RefrigerantSide® Services
The Company provides decontamination and recovery services that are performed at a customer’s site through the use of portable, high volume, high-speed proprietary equipment, including the proprietary Zugibeast® system. Certain of these RefrigerantSide® Services, which encompass system decontamination, and refrigerant recovery and reclamation, are also proprietary and are covered by process patents.
In addition to the decontamination and recovery services previously described, the Company also provides predictive and diagnostic services for its customers. The Company offers diagnostic services that are intended to predict potential problems in air conditioning, process cooling and refrigeration systems before they occur. The Company’s Chiller Chemistry® offering integrates several fluid tests of an operating system and the corresponding laboratory results into an engineering report providing its customers with an understanding of the current condition of the fluids, the cause for any abnormal findings and the potential consequences if the abnormal findings are not remediated. Fluid Chemistry®, an abbreviated version of the Company’s Chiller Chemistry® offering, is designed to quickly identify systems that require further examination.

The Company has also been awarded several US patents for its SmartEnergy OPS®, which is a system for measuring, modifying and improving the efficiency of energy systems, including air conditioning and refrigeration systems, in industrial and commercial applications. This service is a web-based real time continuous monitoring service applicable to a facility’s chiller plant systems. The SmartEnergy OPS® offering enables customers to monitor and improve their chiller plant performance and proactively identify and correct system inefficiencies. SmartEnergy OPS® is able to identify specific inefficiencies in the operation of chiller plant systems and, when used with Hudson’s RefrigerantSide ® Services, can increase the efficiency of the operating systems thereby reducing energy usage and costs. Improving the system efficiency reduces power consumption thereby directly reducing CO 2 emissions at the power plants or onsite. Lastly, the Company’s ChillSmart® offering, which combines the system optimization with the Company’s Chiller Chemistry ® offering, provides a snapshot of a packaged chiller’s operating efficiency and health. ChillSmart® provides a very effective predictive maintenance tool and helps our customers to identify the operating chillers that cause higher operating costs.
The Company’s engineers who developed and support SmartEnergy OPS® are recognized as Energy Experts and Qualified Best Practices Specialists by the United States Department of Energy (“DOE”) in the areas of Steam and Process Heating under the DOE “Best Practices” program, and are the Lead International Energy Experts for steam, chillers and refrigeration systems for the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (“UNIDO”). The Company’s staff have trained more than 4,000 industrial plant personnel in the US and internationally and have developed, and are currently delivering, training curriculums in 12 different countries. The Company’s staff have completed more than 200 industrial ESAs in the US and internationally.

The Company’s sales personnel are compensated on a combination of a base salary and commission. The Company’s executive officers devote significant time and effort to customer relationships.
Competition
The Company competes primarily on the basis of the performance of its proprietary high volume, high-speed equipment used in its operations, the breadth of services offered by the Company, including proprietary RefrigerantSide® Services and other on-site services, and price, particularly with respect to refrigerant sales.
The Company competes with numerous regional and national companies that market reclaimed and virgin refrigerants and provide refrigerant reclamation services. Certain of these competitors may possess greater financial, marketing, distribution and other resources for the sale and distribution of refrigerants than the Company.
Hudson’s RefrigerantSide® Services provide solutions to certain problems within the refrigeration industry and, as such, the demand and market acceptance for these services are subject to uncertainty. Competition for these services primarily consists of traditional periodic maintenance and repair methods of solving the industry’s problems. The Company’s marketing strategy is to educate the marketplace that its alternative solutions are available and that RefrigerantSide® Services are superior to traditional methods.
Risk Management
The Company carries insurance coverage that it considers sufficient to protect the Company’s assets and operations. The Company attempts to operate in a professional and prudent manner and to reduce potential liability risks through specific risk management efforts, including ongoing employee training.
The refrigerant industry involves potentially significant risks of statutory and common law liability for environmental damage and personal injury. The Company, and in certain instances, its officers, directors and employees, may be subject to claims arising from the Company’s on-site or off-site services, including the improper release, spillage, misuse or mishandling of refrigerants classified as hazardous or non-hazardous substances or materials. The Company may be held strictly liable for damages, which could be substantial, regardless of whether it exercised due care and complied with all relevant laws and regulations.
Hudson maintains environmental impairment insurance of $10,000,000 per occurrence, and $10,000,000 annual aggregate, for events occurring subsequent to November 1996.
Government Regulation
The business of refrigerant and industrial gas sales, reclamation and management is subject to extensive, stringent and frequently changing federal, state and local laws and substantial regulation under these laws by governmental agencies, including the EPA, the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and the United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”).
Among other things, these regulatory authorities impose requirements which regulate the handling, packaging, labeling, transportation and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous materials and the health and safety of workers, and require the Company and, in certain instances, its employees, to obtain and maintain licenses in connection with its operations. This extensive regulatory framework imposes significant compliance burdens and risks on the Company.
Hudson and its customers are subject to the requirements of the Clean Air Act and the AIM Act, and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the EPA, which make it unlawful for any person in the course of maintaining, servicing, repairing, and disposing of air conditioning or refrigeration equipment, to knowingly vent or otherwise release or dispose of ozone depleting substances, and non-ozone depleting substitutes, used as refrigerants.

Pursuant to the Act, reclaimed refrigerant must satisfy the same purity standards as newly manufactured, virgin refrigerants in accordance with standards established by AHRI prior to resale to a person other than the owner of the equipment from which it was recovered. The EPA administers a certification program pursuant to which applicants certify to reclaim refrigerants in compliance with AHRI standards. The Company has two of only four certified refrigerant testing laboratories in the United States under AHRI’s laboratory certification program, which is a voluntary program that certifies the ability of a laboratory to test refrigerant in accordance with the AHRI 700 standard. In addition, the EPA has established a mandatory certification program for air conditioning and refrigeration technicians. Hudson’s technicians have applied for or obtained such certification.
The Company may also be subject to regulations adopted by the EPA which impose reporting requirements arising out of the importation of certain HCFCs, and arising out of the importation, purchase, production, use and/or emissions of certain greenhouse gases, including HFCs.
The Company is also subject to regulations adopted by the DOT which classify most refrigerants and industrial gases handled by the Company as hazardous materials or substances and imposes requirements for handling, packaging, labeling and transporting refrigerants and which regulate the use and operation of the Company’s commercial motor vehicles used in the Company’s business.
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (“RCRA”), requires facilities that treat, store or dispose of hazardous wastes to comply with certain operating standards. Before transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes off-site, generators of such waste must package and label their shipments consistent with detailed regulations and prepare a manifest identifying the material and stating its destination. The transporter must deliver the hazardous waste in accordance with the manifest to a facility with an appropriate RCRA permit. Under RCRA, impurities removed from refrigerants consisting of oils mixed with water and other contaminants are not presumed to be hazardous waste.
The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986, as amended, requires the annual reporting by the Company of Emergency and Hazardous Chemical Inventories (Tier II reports) to the various states in which the Company operates and requires the Company to file annual Toxic Chemical Release Inventory Forms with the EPA.
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), establishes liability for clean-up costs and environmental damages to current and former facility owners and operators, as well as persons who transport or arrange for transportation of hazardous substances. Almost all states have similar statutes regulating the handling and storage of hazardous substances, hazardous wastes and non-hazardous wastes. Many such statutes impose requirements that are more stringent than their federal counterparts. The Company could be subject to substantial liability under these statutes to private parties and government entities, in some instances without any fault, for fines, remediation costs and environmental damage, as a result of the mishandling, release, or existence of any hazardous substances at any of its facilities.
The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended, mandates requirements for a safe work place for employees and special procedures and measures for the handling of certain hazardous and toxic substances. State laws, in certain circumstances, mandate additional measures for facilities handling specified materials. The Company is also subject to regulations adopted by the California Air Resources Board which impose certain reporting requirements arising out of the reclamation and sale of refrigerants that takes place within the State of California.
The Company believes that it is in material compliance with all applicable regulations that are material to its business operations.
Quality Assurance & Environmental Compliance
The Company utilizes in-house quality and regulatory compliance control procedures. Hudson maintains its own analytical testing laboratories, which are AHRI certified, to assure that reclaimed refrigerants comply with AHRI purity standards and employs portable testing equipment when performing on-site services to verify certain quality specifications. The Company employs twelve persons engaged full-time in quality control and to monitor the Company’s operations for regulatory compliance.
Human Capital Resources
On February 23, 2023, the Company had 232 full time employees including air conditioning and refrigeration technicians, chemists, engineers, sales and administrative personnel. None of the Company’s employees are represented by a union. The Company believes it has good relations with its employees.
