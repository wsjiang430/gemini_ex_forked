ITEM 1. Business
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or this “Annual Report”, unless the context otherwise indicates, “B&W,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean Babcock & Wilcox Enterprises, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
B&W is a growing, globally-focused renewable, environmental and thermal technologies provider with over 150 years of experience providing diversified energy and emissions control solutions to a broad range of industrial, electrical utility, municipal and other customers. B&W’s innovative products and services are organized into three market-facing segments. Our reportable segments are:
•Babcock & Wilcox Renewable: Cost-effective technologies for efficient and environmentally sustainable power and heat generation, including waste-to-energy, solar construction and installation, biomass energy and black liquor systems for the pulp and paper industry. B&W’s leading technologies support a circular economy, diverting waste from landfills to use for power generation and replacement of fossil fuels, while recovering metals and reducing emissions. To date, we have installed over 500 waste-to-energy and biomass-to-energy units at more than 300 facilities in approximately 30 countries which serve a wide variety of utility, waste management, municipality and investment firm customers. Additionally, we have installed more than 100MW of clean solar production.
•Babcock & Wilcox Environmental: A full suite of best-in-class emissions control and environmental technology solutions for utility, waste to energy, biomass, carbon black, and industrial steam generation applications around the world. B&W’s broad experience includes systems for cooling, ash handling, particulate control, nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxides removal, chemical looping for carbon control, and mercury control. The Company's ClimateBright family of products including SolveBright, OxyBright, BrightLoop and BrightGen, places us at the forefront of carbon dioxide capturing technologies and development with many of the aforementioned products ready for commercial demonstration. 
•Babcock & Wilcox Thermal: Steam generation equipment, aftermarket parts, construction, maintenance and field services for plants in the power generation, oil and gas, and industrial sectors. B&W has an extensive global base of installed equipment for utilities and general industrial applications including refining, petrochemical, food processing, metals and others.
On February 1, 2022, we acquired 100% ownership of Fossil Power Systems, Inc. for approximately $59.2 million. Fossil Power Systems, Inc., is a leading designer and manufacturer of hydrogen, natural gas and renewable pulp and paper combustion equipment including ignitors, plant controls and safety systems based in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada. Fossil Power Systems, Inc. is reported as part of our B&W Thermal segment.
On February 28, 2022, we acquired 100% ownership of Optimus Industries, LLC for approximately $19.2 million. Optimus Industries, LLC designs and manufactures waste heat recovery products for use in power generation, petrochemical, and process industries, including package boilers, watertube and firetube waste heat boilers, economizers, superheaters, waste heat recovery equipment and units for sulfuric acid plants and is based in Tulsa, Oklahoma and Chanute, Kansas. Optimus Industries, LLC is reported as part of our B&W Thermal segment.
Our business depends significantly on the capital, operations and maintenance expenditures of global electric power generating companies, including renewable and thermal powered heat generation industries and industrial facilities with environmental compliance policy requirements. Several factors may influence these expenditures, including:
•climate change initiatives promoting environmental policies including renewable energy options utilizing waste-to-energy or biomass to meet legislative requirements and clean energy portfolio standards in the United States, European, Middle East and Asian markets;
•regulations requiring environmental improvements in various global markets;
•expectations regarding future governmental requirements to further limit or reduce greenhouse gas and other emissions in the United States, Europe and other international climate change sensitive countries; 
•prices for electricity, along with the cost of production and distribution including the cost of fuels within the United States, Europe, Middle East and Asian countries;
•demand for electricity and other end products of steam-generating facilities;
•level of capacity utilization at operating power plants and other industrial uses of steam production;
•maintenance and upkeep requirements at operating power plants, including to combat the accumulated effects of usage;
•overall strength of the industrial industry; and
•ability of electric power generating companies and other steam users to raise capital.
Customer demand is heavily affected by the variations in our customers’ business cycles and by the overall economies and energy, environmental and noise abatement needs of the countries in which they operate.
Market Update
The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to create challenges for us in countries that have significant outbreak mitigation strategies, namely, countries in our Asia-Pacific region, which led to temporary project postponements and has continued to impact results in this region. Additionally, we experienced negative impacts to our global supply chains as a result of COVID-19, the war in Ukraine, Russia-related supply chain shortages and other factors, including disruptions to the manufacturing, supply, distribution, transportation and delivery of our products. We have also observed significant delays and disruptions of our service providers and negative impacts to pricing of certain of their products. These delays and disruptions have had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our ability to meet customers’ demands. We are continuing to actively monitor the impact of these market conditions on current and future periods and actively manage costs and our liquidity position to provide additional flexibility while still supporting our customers and their specific needs. The duration and scope of these conditions cannot be predicted, and therefore, any anticipated negative financial impact to our operating results cannot be reasonably estimated.
Equity Capital Activities
For information regarding our equity activities, see Notes 17 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 9 of this Annual Report.
Debt Capital Activities
For information regarding our debt activities, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Contracts
We execute our contracts through a variety of methods, including fixed-price, cost-plus, target price cost incentive, cost-reimbursable or some combination of these methods. Contracts are usually awarded through a competitive bid process. Factors that customers may consider include price, technical capabilities of equipment and personnel, plant or equipment availability, efficiency, safety record and reputation.
Fixed-price contracts are for a fixed selling price to cover all costs and any profit element for a defined scope of work. Fixed-price contracts entail more risk to us because they require us to predetermine both the quantities of work to be performed and the costs associated with executing the work.
We have contracts that extend beyond one year. Most of our long-term contracts have provisions for progress payments. We attempt to cover anticipated increases in labor, material and service costs of our long-term contracts either through an estimate of such changes, which is reflected in the original price, or through risk-sharing mechanisms, such as escalation or price adjustments for items such as labor and commodity prices. In the event of a contract deferral or cancellation without cause, we generally would be entitled to recover costs incurred, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to deferral or termination. Significant or numerous cancellations could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
From time to time, we partner with other companies to meet the needs of our customers, which can result in project-related joint venture entities or other contractual arrangements. While we carefully select our partners in these arrangements, they can subject us to risks that we may not be able to fully control and may include joint and several liability. 
We generally recognize our contract revenues and related costs over time using the cost-to-cost input method that uses costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Accordingly, we review contractual sales price and cost estimates regularly as the work progresses and reflect adjustments in profit proportionate to the percentage-of-completion in the period when we revise those estimates. To the extent that these adjustments result in a reduction or an elimination of previously reported profits with respect to a contract, we would recognize a charge against current earnings, which could be material.
See further description of risks related to our contracting in Risks Related to Our Operations in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.
Our arrangements with customers frequently require us to provide letters of credit, bid and performance bonds or guarantees to secure bids or performance under contracts, which may involve providing cash collateral or other contract security that we may not be able to provide.
Other sales, such as parts and certain aftermarket service activities, are not in the form of long-term contracts, and we recognize revenues as goods are delivered and work is performed. See further discussion in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Foreign Operations
Our operations in Denmark, including through our recent acquisition of Babcock & Wilcox Renewable Service A/S, provide comprehensive services to companies in the waste-to-energy and biomass to energy sector of the power generation market, currently primarily in Europe. Our operations in Italy provide custom-engineered comprehensive wet and dry cooling solutions and aftermarket parts and services to the power generation industry including natural gas-fired and renewable energy power plants, as well as downstream oil and gas, petrochemical and other industrial end markets in Europe, the Middle East and the Americas. Our operations in Scotland primarily provide boiler cleaning technologies and systems primarily to Europe. Our Canadian operations serve the Canadian industrial power, oil production and electric utility markets. We have manufacturing facilities in Mexico to serve global markets. 
The functional currency of our foreign operating entities is not the United States dollar ("USD"), and as a result, we are subject to exchange rate fluctuations that impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Although we do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risks of currency fluctuations, we evaluate opportunities to engage in hedging in order to limit the risks of currency fluctuations. 
For additional information on the geographic distribution of our revenues, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Competition
With over 150 years of experience, we have a competitive advantage in our experience and technical capability to reliably convert a wide range of fuels to steam. We have supplied highly-engineered energy and environmental equipment in more than 90 countries. Our strong, installed base around the globe also yields competitive advantages, although our markets are highly competitive and price sensitive. We compete with a number of domestic and foreign companies specializing in power generation, environmental control equipment, and cooling systems and services. Each segment’s primary competitors are summarized as follows:

B&W Renewable segment | B&W Environmental segment | B&W Thermal segment
CNIM Group | Hamon Research-Cottrell, Inc. (1) | GE(2) 
Hitachi Zosen | Enexio | MH Power Systems(2)
Martin | Seagull | Babcock Power(2) 
Keppel Seghers | Paharpur | Doosan(2) 
Valmet | Evapco | Clyde Bergemann 
Andritz | SPG Dry | Enerfab 
Steinmuller | Radscan AB | TEI Construction 
 | LAB | APComPower 
 | | Azco, Inc. 

(1)  On July 28, 2022, the Company acquired certain assets of Hamon Holdings Corporation ("Hamon"), a subsidiary of Hamon Research-Cottrell, Inc. The remaining subsidiaries of Hamon-Research-Cottrell continue to be considered competition of this B&W Environmental Segment.
(2) GE, MH Power Systems, Babcock Power & Doosan are also considered primary competitors of the B&W Environmental Segment.
Across each of our segments, we also compete with a variety of engineering and construction companies related to installation of steam generating systems and environmental control equipment; specialized industrial equipment; and other suppliers of replacement parts, repair and alteration services and other services required to retrofit and maintain existing steam generating systems. The primary bases of competition are price, technical capabilities, quality, timeliness of performance, breadth of products and services and willingness to accept contract risks.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
Our operations use raw materials such as carbon and alloy steels in various forms and components and accessories for assembly, which are available from numerous sources. We generally purchase these raw materials and components as needed for individual contracts. We do not depend on a single source of supply for any significant raw materials. Although shortages of some raw materials have existed from time to time, no serious shortage exists at the present time.
Human Capital Resources
Human Capital Management
At December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2,163 employees worldwide, of which approximately 2,100 were full-time. Approximately 491 of our hourly employees are union-affiliated, covered by four union agreements related to active facilities in Mexico, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. We successfully renegotiated two union contracts in 2021 and have one that will expire in early 2023 and one that will expire in 2024. We consider our relationships with our employees and unions to be in good standing.
Workforce Engagement
We believe an engaged global workforce is critical to our success as we work to profitably grow our business as a leading supplier of clean and sustainable energy solutions. 
B&W is known for having a dedicated, long-tenured workforce and for having some of the best, most experienced employees in the industries we serve. Our ability to attract and retain this exceptional talent requires a commitment to open communication about the company’s business, strategy and results with our employees and a globally diverse, inclusive and 
supportive workplace that provides opportunities for growth and career development. It also requires programs that enhance employees’ overall work experience. We have implemented the Responsible and Flexible Workplace Program (“ReFlex”) in the U.S. that provides employees with flexibility in where they work and various work-from-home policies across many of our global operations. While COVID-19 has continued to impact life throughout the world, our employees have remained diligent, customer focused and resilient, and progressive employment programs like ReFlex have provided us with an important competitive advantage. They allow us to keep our facilities running, deliver on our projects and ensure our customers’ needs are met, while also safeguarding the safety and health of our employees. Through ReFlex, our employees have needed flexibility and autonomy in how they work, particularly during these unprecedented times. 
Compensation and Benefits
We also believe it is important to provide competitive compensation and benefits programs for our employees. In addition to salaries, we offer the following benefits, among others, which vary by employee level and by the country where the employees are located:
•contributory healthcare, dental and vision benefits
•bonuses,
•stock awards, 
•retirement programs (including pension and savings plans), 
•health savings and flexible spending accounts,
•paid time off,
•paid parental leave, 
•disability programs, 
•and employee assistance programs.
Core Values
At B&W, our values of safety, ethics, quality, integrity, respect and agility are at the foundation of our business, and we are focused on efficiently ingraining new employees into that culture, whether they join through the normal recruiting and hiring process, or as we have grown our company through strategic acquisitions. We also believe in the importance of being a good corporate citizen, providing and supporting opportunities for our employees to make a positive impact in the communities where they live and work.
Our Board is actively engaged with our workforce practices and policies, and regularly receives updates and provides input on key culture topics, including employee engagement, employee development and succession planning.
Patents and Patent Licenses
We currently hold a large number of United States and foreign patents and have patent applications pending. We have acquired patents and technology licenses and granted technology licenses to others when we have considered it advantageous for us to do so. Although in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single patent or license or group of related patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole. In general, we depend on our technological capabilities and the application thereof, rather than patents and licenses, in the conduct of our various businesses.
Research and Development Activities
Our research and development activities improve our products through innovations to reduce the cost of our products to make them more competitive and through innovations to reduce performance risk of our products to better meet our customer expectations. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Permits and Licenses
We are required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to our operations. The kinds of permits, licenses and certificates required in our operations depend upon a number of factors. We are not aware of any material noncompliance and believe our operations and certifications are currently in compliance with all relevant permits, licenses and certifications.
Environmental
We have been identified as a potentially responsible party at various cleanup sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (“CERCLA”). CERCLA and other environmental laws can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any of the potentially responsible parties, regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original conduct. Generally, however, where there are multiple responsible parties, a final allocation of costs is made based on the amount and type of wastes disposed of by each party and the number of financially viable parties, although this may not be the case with respect to any particular site. We have not been determined to be a major contributor of wastes to any of these sites. On the basis of our relative contribution of waste to each site, we expect our share of the ultimate liability for the various sites will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in any given year.
Government Regulations 
We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other countries that involve matters central to our business, including those relating to:
•the construction and manufacture of renewable, environmental and thermal products;
•clean air and other environmental protection legislation;
•taxation of domestic and foreign earnings;
•tariffs, duties, or trade sanctions and other trade barriers imposed by foreign countries that restrict or prohibit business transactions in certain markets;
•user privacy, security, data protection, content, and online-payment services;
•intellectual property; 
•transactions in or with foreign countries or officials; and
•use of local employees and suppliers.
