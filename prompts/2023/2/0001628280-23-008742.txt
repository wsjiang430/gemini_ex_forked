Background
The Company (through its subsidiaries) provides turn-key wireless infrastructure services for wireless carriers, tower companies and equipment manufacturers, and distributes and services a comprehensive line of electronics and hardware for the telecommunications industry. The Company was incorporated under the laws of Oklahoma in September 1989 as “ADDvantage Media Group, Inc.”  In December 1999, its name was changed to ADDvantage Technologies Group, Inc. In 2019, the Company moved its headquarters from Broken Arrow, Oklahoma to Carrollton, Texas and acquired Fulton Technologies, Inc. (“Fulton”) on January 4, 2019, which established the Company’s Wireless Infrastructure Services segment. The Company’s Telecommunications segment operates through its subsidiaries, Nave Communications Company (“Nave”) and ADDvantage Triton, LLC (“Triton”).
Our wireless infrastructure subsidiary provides services such as wireless macro site development, distributed antenna systems, small cells and project management expertise with national and regional scalability. Fulton's expertise includes site modifications, tower retrofits, including 5G, civil construction, tower erection, utility installation and testing, site acquisition including leasing, zoning and permitting, design and architect-engineering services. 
For our telecommunications subsidiaries, we sell new, surplus-new and refurbished equipment that we purchase in the market as a result of telecommunications system upgrades or overstock supplies.  We maintain one of the industry's largest inventories of new and used equipment, which allows us to expedite delivery of system-critical products to our customers. In addition, we offer our customers decommissioning services for surplus and obsolete equipment, which we in turn process through our recycling program. We continually evaluate new product offerings in the broader telecommunications industry as technology evolves and upgrade our product offerings to stay current with our customer’s technology platforms.

Operating Segments
The Company’s current reportable segments are Wireless Infrastructure Services (“Wireless”) and Telecommunications (“Telco”).  
Products and Services
Wireless Segment
We provide turn-key wireless infrastructure services for the four major U.S. wireless carriers, communication tower companies, national integrators, and original equipment manufacturers that support these wireless carriers.  These services primarily consist of the installation and upgrade of technology on cell sites and the construction of new small cells for 5G.
Fulton has 90 employees.  Fulton performs equipment installations, upgrades and maintenance services for its customers primarily on communication towers. Having the proper safety record, training capability and quality oversight is paramount in the industry. Fulton has prided itself in performing work in a safe and timely manner and delivering high-quality services to its clients. Demand for tower equipment installation and upgrade services has notably increased as observed. We expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future as wireless carriers continue to add capacity, expand their networks and upgrade their current technology for high speed connectivity to 5G.
Fulton also supports the installation and support of temporary tower locations.  This niche and growing business includes the erection of temporary towers to allow for the maintenance of permanent locations without causing a degradation of wireless coverage in the area.  In addition, Fulton provides temporary tower solutions for special events that require an increase of coverage and capacity for festivals, concerts and sporting events.  Fulton has an inventory of temporary poles of different sizes and uses a unique installation process for the quick deployment of a tower location with little to no environmental impact. 
Telco Segment
The Telco segment provides quality new and used telecommunication networking equipment, including both central office and customer premise equipment, to its customer base of telecommunications providers, enterprise customers and resellers by utilizing its inventory from a broad range of manufacturers as well as other supply channels.  This segment also offers its customers repair and testing services for telecommunications networking equipment.  In addition, this segment offers its customers decommissioning services for surplus and obsolete equipment, which it in turn processes through its recycling partner.
Central Office Equipment – Central office equipment includes optical transport, switching, and data center equipment on a customer’s communication network.  Optical equipment products aggregate and transport internet traffic; switching equipment products originate, terminate and route voice traffic; and data equipment products transport internet and voice over internet protocol traffic via routers.
Customer Premise Equipment  – Consumer premise equipment includes integrated access devices, channel banks, internet protocol private branch exchange or IP PBX phones, and routers that are placed inside the customer site that will receive the communication signal from the communication services provider. 
In addition, we offer our customers decommissioning services for surplus and obsolete telecom equipment, which we then process through a Responsible Recycling certified recycling partner.

Sales and Marketing
Wireless Segment
The Wireless segment accounted for 32%, 38%, and 33% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, the transition period of three months ended December 31, 2021, and the year ended September 30, 2021, respectively. In 2022, wireless tower and temporary tower services, including the procurement of the requisite materials, represented substantially all of the Wireless segment’s revenues.  In this segment, we market and sell our services to wireless carriers, wireless equipment providers and tower companies.
Telco Segment
The Telco segment accounted for 68%, 62%, and 67% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, the transition period of three months ended December 31, 2021, and the year ended September 30, 2021, respectively. Sales of new products in 2022 represented 16% of revenues and refurbished products represented 83%. Repair services, recycle sales and other services contributed the remaining 1% of Telco segment revenues. In this segment, we market and sell our products to franchise and private multiple-system operators,, telecommunication companies, system contractors, other industry resellers, enterprise customers and directly to consumers via online sales. Our sales and marketing are predominantly performed by our experienced internal sales and customer service staff, outside sales representatives located in various geographic and strategic areas of the country, and many online sales channel platforms such as our own website, Amazon, Walmart, eBay and Newegg.  The majority of our sales activity is generated through customer relationships developed by our sales personnel and executives, referrals from manufacturers we represent, and online advertising.
We maintain a wide breadth of new and used products and many times can offer our customers same day shipments.  We believe we carry one of the most diverse inventories of any telecommunication product reseller in the country, and we have access to additional inventory via our various supply channels.  We believe our investment in on-hand inventory, our product supply channels, and our experienced sales and customer service team create a competitive advantage for us.
Suppliers
The Telco segment primarily purchases its used inventory from telecommunication companies and wholesale suppliers that have excess equipment on hand or have upgraded their systems or from other resellers in this industry.
Seasonality
In the Wireless segment, the services that we provide on our customers’ wireless towers are outdoors and can be damaged by storms and power surges. Consequently, we can experience increased demand on certain product offerings during the months between late spring and early fall when severe weather or consistent rain tends to be more prominent than at other times during the year. Winter months are generally slower due to the cold weather conditions, and the inability to access wireless towers during periods of heavy snow and ice.
In the Telco segment, we do not anticipate that quarterly operating results will generally be impacted by seasonal fluctuations, other than normal business fluctuations during the winter holiday season.
Competition
Wireless Segment
The wireless infrastructure services business competes with other wireless service companies on a local, regional or national basis. In some areas, Fulton provides services that its customers can also provide utilizing their in-house personnel. However, most of the direct competition in the Wireless segment is regionally based from companies of a similar size. In niche areas of service, like our Special Events and Temporary Pole business in the Midwest and in certain markets, the Wireless segment has few competitors due to its expertise and the required investment in equipment and assets. The level of competition can vary based on demand characteristics in certain markets.
For the Wireless segment, we believe our differentiation from other service providers in the marketplace is primarily the following:
•Past performance and experience developed over 30 years;
•Robust safety organization;
•Ability to recruit and retain personnel and a Midwest workforce of long-tenured personnel of 20 to 30-plus years of service;
•Broad range of multi-year master service agreements in place with carriers, original equipment manufacturers (OEM’s), tower owners and integrators;
•Industry relationships; and
•Having a diversified offering of services based on know-how and equipment.
Telco Segment
The overall telecommunications equipment industry is highly competitive.  We compete with numerous resellers in the marketplace that sell both direct and online.
For the Telco segment, we believe our differentiation from other resellers includes:
•Broad range of new, refurbished and used inventory, which allows us to meet our customers’ timing needs;
•Ability to source unique and sometimes rare, high demand inventory;
•Offer a range of repair and testing capabilities to help improve the quality of our inventory as well as offering repair and testing of equipment as a service to our customers and vendors;
•Experienced sales support staff that maintain strong and longstanding relationships with our customers;
•Sales force that has a strong technical knowledge of the products we offer;
•Provide multiple services for our customers including deinstallation and decommission of products, storage and management of spare inventory and recycling.
Working Capital Practices
In the Wireless segment, we utilize quick payment accounts receivable programs with our major customers and our bank to decrease the amount of time between project completion and payment. The majority of working capital needs result from the payment of project related costs before invoicing the customer. This includes personnel, subcontractors, equipment rentals and materials.  Although the quick payment programs are in place to accelerate receivable payments, working capital is necessary to complete the jobs and provide the necessary closeout packages required for customer approval. 
In the Telco segment, we utilize quick payment accounts receivable programs with our bank to decrease the time between sale of inventory and collection.  We choose to carry a relatively large volume of inventory due to our on-hand, on-demand business model.  We typically utilize excess cash flows to reinvest in inventory to maintain or 
expand our product offerings. The greatest need for working capital occurs when we make bulk purchases of surplus-new and used inventory, or when our OEM suppliers offer additional discounts on large purchases. 
On March 17, 2022, the Company replaced its $3.0 million credit facility for its Nave and Triton subsidiaries with its primary financial lender with new accounts receivable purchase facilities. The Company also restructured its accounts receivable purchase facilities secured by the Company’s Fulton subsidiary’s receivables. With the new and restructured receivables purchase facilities, the Company has an overall capacity to factor its accounts receivable of $19.0 million for working capital needs.

One Telco customer accounted for 11% of consolidated revenues, and 17% of Telco segment revenues.

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, component price increases were observed in the fiscal fourth quarter, which negatively impacted our gross margins in the Wireless segment. 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
