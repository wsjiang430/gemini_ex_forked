ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
Capricor Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of transformative cell and exosome-based therapeutics for treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, a rare form of muscular dystrophy which results in muscle degeneration and premature death, and other diseases with high unmet medical needs. 
Our Programs
Cell Therapy (CAP-1002) for the Treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (Phase III) 
Our core program is focused on the development and commercialization of a cell therapy (referred herein as CAP-1002) comprised of cardiosphere-derived cells (“CDCs”), which are an endogenous population of stromal cells isolated from donated cells of healthy human hearts for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“DMD”). CAP-1002 is designed to slow disease progression in DMD through the immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic actions of CDCs, which are mediated by secreted exosomes laden with bioactive cargo. Among the cargo elements known to be bioactive in CDC-exosomes are microRNAs. Collectively, these non-coding RNA species alter gene expression in macrophages and other target cells, dialing down generalized inflammation and stimulating tissue regeneration in DMD (and in a variety of other inflammatory diseases). This mechanism of action, which is consistent with the changes observed in clinical studies to date in circulating inflammatory biomarkers, contrasts with that of exon-skipping oligonucleotides and gene therapy approaches which aim to restore dystrophin expression. DMD is a rare form of muscular dystrophy which results in muscle degeneration and premature death. Additionally, the absence of dystrophin in muscle cells leads to significant cell damage and ultimately causes muscle cell death and fibrotic replacement. The annual cost of care for patients with DMD is very high and increases with disease progression. We therefore believe that DMD represents a significant market opportunity for our product candidate, CAP-1002.
​
To date, we have completed two promising clinical trials investigating CAP-1002 for DMD. Data from the first trial, a Phase I/II trial named HOPE-Duchenne, suggested improvements in skeletal and cardiac endpoints. In HOPE-2, a Phase II clinical trial conducted in the United States, CAP-1002 was used to treat patients with late-stage DMD. In March 2022, we announced that the final one-year results from HOPE-2 were published in The Lancet showing that the trial met its primary efficacy endpoint of the mid-level dimension of the Performance of the Upper Limb (“PUL”) v1.2 (p=0.01) and additional positive endpoints of full PUL v2.0 (p=0.04) and a cardiac endpoint of left ventricular ejection fraction (p=0.002). CAP-1002 was generally safe and well-tolerated throughout the studies. Additionally, we are conducting an open label extension (“OLE”) study of the HOPE-2 trial in which 12 patients have elected to continue treatment of CAP-1002. We recently announced positive one-year and 18-month results from this ongoing OLE study. Data from the OLE study suggests disease modification with statistically significant differences in the PUL v2.0 scale in the CAP-1002 original treatment group when compared to the original placebo group from HOPE-2. In addition, disease progression was attenuated equally in both groups once patients began treatment in the OLE. CAP-1002 treatment during the OLE portion of the study continues to yield a consistent safety profile and has been well-tolerated throughout the study. 
​
We are currently enrolling the HOPE-3, Phase III clinical study investigating CAP-1002 for the treatment of late-stage DMD patients for the potential approval of CAP-1002 in the United States. HOPE-3 is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study currently designed to treat up to 68 subjects at approximately 15-20 investigative sites in the United States. The primary outcome measure will be the full PUL v2.0 at one-year. HOPE-3 will also measure various secondary endpoints including cardiac function assessments. We have currently treated over 30% of the patients in the currently designed study and have 11 active sites. At this time, our plans to conduct an interim analysis for sample size re-estimation and analysis of conditional power remain unchanged and we anticipate that these results will be available in the fourth quarter of this year. 
​
Under our RMAT designation, we recently met with the FDA in a Type-B CMC meeting where we discussed our manufacturing plans in anticipation of a potential BLA application. In the meeting, we discussed our plans with respect to commercial manufacturing activities, including our potency assay and other product release criteria to support commercialization. We are awaiting the meeting minutes from the FDA, but at this time, we believe that we will need to 

4




add some patients to HOPE-3 who will be treated with product manufactured at our new San Diego facility, in order to support a potential BLA application. Our San Diego facility is designed to produce commercial-scale GMP CAP-1002 product and we believe that it will be available to manufacture CAP-1002 doses by the third quarter of 2023. We plan to request a follow-on Type B clinical meeting with FDA and expect to have further clarity following that meeting on this topic. Furthermore, at the request of the FDA, we have submitted the interim results from our HOPE-2 OLE for their review and we continue to discuss our pathway towards potential registration. 
​
The regulatory pathway for CAP-1002 is supported by Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”) designation as well as orphan drug designation. If Capricor were to receive market approval for CAP-1002 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), Capricor would be eligible to receive a Priority Review Voucher based on its designation as a rare pediatric disease. Capricor has entered into two Commercialization and Distribution Agreements with Nippon Shinyaku, Co., Ltd. (“Nippon Shinyaku”) appointing Nippon Shinyaku as its exclusive distributor of CAP-1002 in the United States and Japan. 
​
Exosomes Platform (Preclinical)
​
Our exosome platform program consists of engineered exosomes and exosomes derived from CDCs (CAP-2003), both of which are in various stages of preclinical development. Aspects of our exosomes pipeline have been supported through collaborations and alliances. Our collaborations around exosomes include Johns Hopkins University (“JHU”), the Department of Defense (“DoD”), the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research (“USAISR”), the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (“CSMC”).
​
Engineered Exosome-Based Therapeutics and Vaccines
We are focused on developing a precision-engineered exosome platform technology that has the ability to deliver defined sets of effector molecules which exert their effects through defined mechanisms of action. We recently published new preclinical data on our StealthXTM platform showing the rapid development of a recombinant protein-based vaccine for immunization and prevention against SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. At this time, we are developing exosome-based vaccines and therapeutics for infectious diseases, monogenic diseases and other potential indications. Our current strategy is focused on securing partners who will provide capital and additional resources to bring this program into the clinic, should we decide to do so. 
​
CDC-Derived Exosomes (CAP-2003)
CAP-2003 is the name of our exosomes product candidate which are derived from our CDCs. We have promising preclinical data in several indications from studies done utilizing CAP-2003 in our labs as well as in collaboration with other companies and academic institutions. In 2020, we filed an IND with the FDA to investigate the use of CAP-2003 in patients with DMD. The FDA has requested more information related to manufacturing for this product candidate and we are evaluating the next steps for this program as we continue to further develop our exosome platform. 
​
Our Technologies
Cardiosphere-Derived Cells (CAP-1002)
Our core cell therapy technology is based on cardiosphere-derived cells, a cardiac-derived cell therapy that was first identified in the academic laboratory of Capricor’s scientific founder, Dr. Eduardo Marbán while he was Chief of Cardiology at JHU. Since the initial publication in 2007, CDCs have been the subject of over 100 peer-reviewed scientific publications and have been administered to over 200 human subjects across several clinical trials. CDCs have been shown to exert potent immunomodulatory activity and to alter the immune system’s activity to encourage cellular regeneration. We have been developing allogeneic CDCs (CAP-1002) as a product candidate for the treatment of DMD and investigating their effects on skeletal-muscular and cardiac function. Preclinical and clinical data support the therapeutic concept of administering CDCs as a means to address conditions in which the skeletal or heart muscle has been damaged.
​
In a variety of preclinical experimental models of heart injury, CDCs have been shown to stimulate cell proliferation and blood vessel growth and to inhibit programmed cell death and scar formation. Published data by CSMC, which tested the effectiveness of CDCs in a mouse model of DMD, showed for the first time that the skeletal and cardiac improvements could be directly attributed to treatment with CDCs. The data also provide further evidence of the potential 

5




of CDCs to stimulate tissue repair and regeneration by first reducing inflammation, which then enables new healthy muscle to form, as was shown in the mouse model of DMD.
​
CDCs are derived from cardiospheres (“CSps”), which are self-adherent multicellular clusters derived from the heart. CDCs are sufficiently small that, within acceptable dose limits, they can be infused into a coronary artery or into the peripheral vasculature. Capricor has performed clinical studies to establish the range of CDC dose levels that appear to be safe via intracoronary administration and peripheral venous access. While CDCs originate from either a deceased human donor (allogeneic source) or from heart tissue taken directly from recipient patients themselves (autologous source), the methods for manufacturing CDCs from either source are similar.
​
Capricor’s proprietary manufacturing methods are focused on producing therapeutic doses of CDCs to boost the regenerative capacity of the skeletal and heart muscles, with the goal of improving skeletal and cardiac muscle function. Capricor has exclusively licensed intellectual property covering CDCs and CSps from three academic institutions and is also pursuing its own intellectual property rights relating to CDCs as a product candidate.

​
Exosomes
Extracellular vesicles, including exosomes and microvesicles, are nano-scale, membrane-enclosed vesicles which are secreted by most cells and contain characteristic lipids, proteins and nucleic acids such as mRNA and microRNAs. They can signal through the binding and activation of membrane receptors or through the delivery of their cargo into the cytosol of target cells. Our preclinical data has shown that CDCs mediate most of their therapeutic activities through the secretion of extracellular vesicles.
​
Exosomes act as messengers to regulate the functions of neighboring or distant cells and have been shown to regulate functions such as cell survival, proliferation, inflammation and tissue regeneration. Furthermore, preclinical research has shown that exogenously-administered exosomes can modify cellular activities, thereby supporting their therapeutic potential. Their size, low or null immunogenicity and ability to communicate in native cellular language potentially makes them an exciting new class of therapeutic agents with the potential to expand our ability to address complex biological responses. Because exosomes are a cell-free substance, they can be stored, handled, reconstituted and administered in similar fashion to common biopharmaceutical products such as antibodies.

CAP-1002: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Program
Background on Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
DMD is a rare form of muscular dystrophy which results in muscle degeneration and premature death. DMD affects approximately 1 in 3,600 male infants worldwide, and it is estimated that approximately 15,000 to 20,000 boys and young men are living with the disease in the United States and approximately 200,000 worldwide. DMD results from the lack of functional dystrophin protein caused by a gene mutation. The lack of dystrophin, an important structural component of muscle cells, causes them to have increased susceptibility to damage and to progressively die. Additionally, the absence of dystrophin in muscle cells leads to significant cell damage and ultimately causes muscle cell death and fibrotic replacement. In DMD patients, heart muscle cells progressively die and are replaced with scar tissue. This cardiomyopathy eventually leads to heart failure, which is currently the leading cause of death among those with DMD. 
​
Patients with DMD experience progressive muscle weakness and degeneration starting at an early age. Generally, a loss of ambulation occurs after the first decade of life and eventually the patients suffer respiratory and cardiac failure. Their lifespan is abbreviated and averages less than three decades. The annual cost of care for patients with DMD is very high and increases with disease progression. We therefore believe that DMD represents a significant market opportunity for our product candidate, CAP-1002.

​
Phase III HOPE-3 Clinical Trial
​
HOPE-3 is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study currently designed to treat up to 68 subjects at approximately 15-20 investigative sites in the United States. The clinical trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of repeat, intravenous (“IV”) doses of CAP-1002, in boys and young men with evidence of skeletal muscle impairment regardless of ambulatory status and who are on a stable regimen of systemic glucocorticoids. HOPE-3 participants will be randomized to either CAP-1002 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. The active arm of participants in the trial will receive 150 million cardiosphere-derived cells (CAP-1002) via intravenous infusion every 3 months for a total of 4 doses. The study’s primary outcome measure will be the PUL v2.0, a validated tool specifically designed for assessing high (shoulder), mid (elbow) and distal (wrist and hand) function, with a conceptual framework reflecting weakness progression in upper limb function. HOPE-3 will also measure various secondary endpoints including cardiac function assessments. Enrollment is currently ongoing at 11 active clinical trial investigative sites in the United States.
​
Phase II HOPE-2 Clinical Trial
HOPE-2 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial which was conducted at multiple sites located in the United States. We randomized 20 patients in our HOPE-2 clinical trial. Approximately 80% of the patients were non-ambulant and all patients were on a stable regimen of steroids. Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar between the two treatment groups. The clinical trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of repeat, IV, doses of CAP-1002, in boys and young men with evidence of skeletal muscle impairment regardless of ambulatory status and who were on a stable regimen of systemic glucocorticoids. 
​
While there are many clinical initiatives in DMD, HOPE-2 was one of the very few to focus on predominantly non-ambulant patients. These boys and young men are looking to maintain what function they have in their arms and hands, and Capricor’s previous Phase I/II (HOPE-Duchenne) study of a single intracoronary dose of CAP-1002 provided promising preliminary evidence on the retention or slowing of the loss of upper limb function.
​
The primary efficacy endpoint of the HOPE-2 trial was the relative change in patients’ abilities to perform manual tasks that relate to activities of daily living and are important to their quality of life. These abilities were measured through the Performance of the Upper Limb PUL test. In the HOPE-2 study, we have evaluated these through both the PUL 1.2 and 2.0 versions. Although the PUL v1.2 for the mid-level was the primary endpoint established for the trial, we also conducted an analysis using the PUL v2.0 as the FDA suggested the use of the updated PUL v2.0 as the primary efficacy endpoint in support of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”). HOPE-2 assessed the mid-level dimension of the PUL which evaluates one’s ability to use muscles extending from the elbow to the hand, which muscles are essential for operating wheelchairs and performing other daily functions. In HOPE-2, additional secondary and exploratory endpoints such as cardiac function, pulmonary function, quality of life and additional measures were included.
​
In July 2019, we reported interim top-line results from a pre-specified interim analysis of 6-month data from the HOPE-2 trial which showed promising results across several independent clinical measures. 
​
In September 2021, we reported the final 12-month results from the HOPE-2 study and subsequently, in March 2022, we announced that the results were published in The Lancet. The final data showed improvements in upper limb and cardiac function with p-values of less than p=0.05 in multiple measures. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), a global measure of cardiac pump function, decreased in the placebo group over time, but improved in the CAP-1002 group, showing a 107% slowing of progression of cardiac disease (p=0.002). Additionally, the final data suggested global improvements in cardiac function as measured by indexed volumes (LVESV, LVEDV). These are surrogate measures of cardiac function and are considered significant in terms of relevance to long term outcomes. Furthermore, the data showed a reduction in the biomarker CK-MB, an enzyme that is only released when there is cardiac muscle cell damage. In normal human subjects, there is typically no CK-MB measurable in the blood. It is well accepted that continuous muscle cell damage in DMD leads to pathologically high enzyme levels associated with cardiac muscle cell loss. In HOPE-2, treatment with CAP-1002 was associated with a reduction in CK-MB levels as compared to placebo. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical study in DMD that correlates cardiac functional stabilization with a reduction of a biomarker of cell damage. With the exception of steroids, preservation of function in DMD is uncommon. The results of the placebo patients were consistent with natural history, but in the treated group, most patients were stable or improved on these endpoints throughout the one-year treatment period.

Safety
CAP-1002 was generally safe and well tolerated throughout the study. With the exception of hypersensitivity reactions early in the clinical trial, which were mitigated with a common pre-medication regimen, there were no serious safety signals identified by the HOPE-2 Data and Safety Monitoring Board (“DSMB”).

​
Open Label Extension (OLE) HOPE-2 Clinical Trial
We are conducting an open-label extension available to all patients who participated in the HOPE-2 study which includes those patients who received placebo. After the completion of the HOPE-2 study, all patients stopped treatment for approximately 392 days, which is referred to as the gap phase. Then all eligible patients who wished to remain on treatment re-entered the OLE study where they received CAP-1002 (150 million cells per infusion) every three months. Patients in the ongoing study are being evaluated using the PUL v2.0 as well as cardiac assessments at certain time-points. 
We recently announced positive one-year and 18-month results from this ongoing OLE study. Data from the OLE study continues to show evidence for disease modification with statistically significant differences in the PUL v2.0 scale in the CAP-1002 original treatment group when compared to the original placebo group from HOPE-2. CAP-1002 treatment during the OLE portion of the study continues to yield a consistent safety profile and has been well-tolerated throughout the study. We plan to report the 24-month OLE data in the second quarter of this year. 
Phase I/II HOPE-Duchenne Clinical Trial
In 2017, we completed the randomized, controlled, multi-center Phase I/II HOPE-Duchenne clinical trial which was designed to evaluate the safety and exploratory efficacy of CAP-1002 in patients with cardiomyopathy associated with DMD. Twenty-five patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either CAP-1002 on top of usual care or usual care only. In patients receiving CAP-1002, 25 million cells were infused into each of their three main coronary arteries for a total dose of 75 million cells. It was a one-time treatment, and the last patient was infused in September 2016. Patients were observed over the course of 12 months. Efficacy was evaluated according to several exploratory outcome measures. This study was funded in part through a grant award (the “CIRM Award”) from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (“CIRM”). In January 2019, this study was published in the online issue of Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.
​
We reported our 12-month data from the HOPE-Duchenne trial at a Late-Breaking Science session of the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2017. As shoulder function had already been lost in most of the HOPE-Duchenne participants, investigators used the combined mid-distal PUL subscales to assess changes in skeletal muscle function and found significant improvement in those treated with CAP-1002 in a defined post-hoc analysis. Among the lower-functioning patients, defined as patients with a baseline mid-distal PUL score < 55 out of 58, investigators reported sustained or improved motor function at 12 months in 8 of 9 (89%) patients treated with CAP-1002 as compared to none (0%) of the usual care participants (p=0.007). Additionally, we reported improvements in systolic thickening of the left ventricular wall as well as reduction in scarring of the heart muscle among those treated with CAP-1002 decreased relative to the control group.
​
CAP-1002 was generally safe and well-tolerated in the HOPE-Duchenne trial. There was no significant difference in the incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events in either group. There were no early study discontinuations due to adverse events.
​
Regulatory Designations for CAP-1002 for the treatment of DMD
In April 2015, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to CAP-1002 for the treatment of DMD. Orphan drug designation is granted by the FDA’s Office of Orphan Drug Products to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States or a disease or condition that affects more than 200,000 people in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. This designation confers special incentives to the drug developer, including tax credits on the clinical development costs and prescription drug user fee waivers and may allow for a seven-year period of market exclusivity in the United States upon FDA approval.
​
In July 2017, the FDA granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation to CAP-1002 for the treatment of DMD. The FDA defines a “rare pediatric disease” as a serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years and that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a disease or condition that affects more than 200,000 people in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of 

10




disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Under the FDA's Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program, upon the approval of a qualifying New Drug Application (“NDA”) or BLA for the treatment of a rare pediatric disease, the sponsor of such application would be eligible for a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher that can be used to obtain priority review for a subsequent NDA or BLA. The Priority Review Voucher may be sold or transferred an unlimited number of times.
​
In February 2018, we were notified by the FDA Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies, that we were granted the RMAT designation for CAP-1002 for the treatment of DMD. The FDA grants the RMAT designation to regenerative medicine therapies intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates a potential to address unmet medical needs for that condition. The RMAT designation makes therapies eligible for the same actions to expedite the development and review of a marketing application that are available to drugs that receive fast track or breakthrough therapy designation – including increased meeting opportunities, early interactions to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoints and the potential to support accelerated approval. CAP-1002 is one of the few therapies currently in development to help late-stage patients with DMD. To receive the RMAT designation, we submitted data from the HOPE-Duchenne Trial.
​
Collaboration Agreements 
​
To accelerate the advancement of our technologies, we have entered into, and intend to seek other opportunities to form collaborations with a diverse group of strategic partners. We have forged productive collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, government agencies, academic laboratories, and research institutes with diverse area expertise and resources in as effort to advance our programs.

Capricor will be responsible for the conduct of clinical development in Japan, as may be required, as well as the manufacturing of CAP-1002. Capricor will sell commercial product to Nippon Shinyaku. In addition, Capricor or its designee will hold the Marketing Authorization in Japan if the product is approved in that territory.
​
Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research
​
In 2018, we entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the USAISR, pursuant to which we agreed to cooperate in research and development on the evaluation of our CAP-2003 for the treatment of trauma 

11




related injuries and conditions. In 2021, in collaboration with the USAISR, we published a manuscript demonstrating CAP-2003 as a potential antishock therapeutic, if delivered early.
​
Other CAP-1002 Programs
CAP-1002 - Investigator Sponsored Clinical Trials
Capricor provided CAP-1002 for investigational purposes in two clinical trials sponsored by CSMC. These cells were developed as part of the Company’s past research and development efforts. The first trial is known as “Regression of Fibrosis and Reversal of Diastolic Dysfunction in HFpEF Patients Treated with Allogeneic CDCs (the “REGRESS trial”). Dr. Eduardo Marbán is the named principal investigator under the study. The second trial is known as “Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension treated with Cardiosphere-derived Allogeneic Stem Cells (the “ALPHA trial”). In this trial, the investigational product was infused into the venous system via catheter into the right atrium. CSMC informed us that the enrollment of the REGRESS and ALPHA trials have been completed and as a result, we do not expect to receive any further material revenues from these trials.
​
CAP-1002 for the Treatment of Cardiac Conditions
​
In previous years, we completed several trials investigating the use of CAP-1002 for the treatment of various cardiac conditions, including heart failure (the “DYNAMIC Trial”) and post myocardial infarction (“MI”) with cardiac dysfunction (the “ALLSTAR trial”). Because of our decision to focus our efforts on DMD, we have decided not to pursue those indications at this time, nor do we have any plans to continue with the development of these programs. We expect no further material expenses in connection with these programs.
​
Engineered Exosome Platform
​
StealthXTM Platform
​
We are focused on developing a precision-engineered exosome platform technology that has the ability to deliver defined sets of effector molecules which exert their effects through defined mechanisms of action. We recently published new preclinical data on our StealthXTM platform showing the rapid development of a recombinant protein-based vaccine for immunization and prevention against SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. The data explored the therapeutic potential of Capricor’s proprietary StealthX™ platform, which generated two vaccine candidates (STX-S and STX-N), that independently, and in combination (STX-S+N), induced a strong immune response against two SARS-CoV-2 proteins, spike and nucleocapsid. Results showed that this multivalent, protein-based vaccine candidate has the potential to achieve potent, longer lasting immunization, broaden reactivity and improve T-cell response with only nanograms of protein without any adjuvant. The data from this study suggests that StealthX™ could potentially deliver a more potent vaccine with broader immunity than is currently available, by combining the advantages of both mRNA and recombinant protein vaccines into a potentially superior, rapidly generated, low-dose vaccine.

The current study used engineered exosomes to express either SARS-CoV-2 spike (StealthX-Spike, STX-S) or nucleocapsid (StealthX-Nucleocapsid, STX-N) protein on the exosome surface rapidly, a timeframe similar to mRNA vaccines. When administered as a single product, both STX-S and STX-N induced strong immunization with the production of a potent humoral and cellular immune response simultaneously. These effects were obtained with administration of only nanograms of protein without the use of any adjuvant or lipid nanoparticles which further supports the potential safety profile of this product candidate. The study also investigated the combination of STX-S and STX-N, namely STX-S+N, in two independent animal models. Administration of this multivalent, low dose protein-based vaccine resulted in increased, persistent antibody production, potent neutralizing antibodies with cross-reactivity to other variants of concern, and strong T-cell response. The results show efficacy of this multivalent protein-based vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 in model systems and suggests that other vaccines or therapeutics could potentially be rapidly developed using the same StealthX™ platform.
​
At this time, we are developing exosome-based vaccines and therapeutics for infectious diseases, monogenic diseases and other potential indications. Our platform builds on advances in fundamental RNA and protein science, targeting technology and manufacturing, providing us the opportunity to potentially build a broad pipeline of new therapeutic candidates. We plan to continue research investigating these vaccine candidates including conducting IND-enabling studies.

Intellectual Property and Proprietary Know-How
Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent rights for our products, formulations, processes, methods of use and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without knowingly infringing on the valid and enforceable proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and abroad. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our current product candidates and any future product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the United States and abroad. Even patent protection, however, may not always afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents. If we fail to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or secure rights to patents of others, the value of our intellectual property rights would diminish. To this end, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure and use of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions relevant to our technologies and important to our business.
The development of complex biotechnology products such as ours typically includes the early discovery of a technology platform – often in an academic institution – followed by increasingly focused development around a product opportunity, including identification and definition of a specific product candidate and development of scalable manufacturing processes, formulations, patient selection and treatment regimes, and delivery and dosage regimens. As a result, biotechnology products are often protected by several families of patent filings that are made at different times in the development cycle and cover different aspects of the product. Earlier filed broad patent applications directed to the discovery of the platform technology thus usually expire ahead of patents covering later developments such as scalable manufacturing processes and dosing regimens. Patent expirations on products may therefore span several years and vary from country to country based on the scope of available coverage. Our patents, or patent applications, if issued and upon payment of patent maintenance fees, would expire as early as 2024 and as late as 2043 or beyond depending on any patent term adjustment or patent term extension. There are also limited opportunities to obtain extensions of patent terms in certain countries.
Intellectual Property Rights for Capricor’s Technology - CAP-1002 and Exosomes
Capricor has entered into exclusive license agreements for intellectual property rights related to certain cardiac-derived cells with Università Degli Studi Di Roma La Sapienza (the “University of Rome”), JHU and CSMC. Capricor has also entered into an exclusive license agreement for intellectual property rights related to exosomes with CSMC and JHU. In addition, Capricor has filed patent applications related to the technology developed by its own scientists.
University of Rome License Agreement
Capricor and the University of Rome entered into a License Agreement, dated June 21, 2006 (the “Rome License Agreement”), which provides for the grant of an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license by the University of Rome to Capricor (with the right to sublicense) to develop and commercialize licensed products under the licensed patent rights in all fields. 
​
Pursuant to the Rome License Agreement, Capricor paid the University of Rome a license issue fee, is currently paying minimum annual royalties in the amount of 20,000 Euros per year, and is obligated to pay a lower-end of a mid-range double-digit percentage on all royalties received as a result of sublicenses granted, which are net of any royalties paid to third parties under a license agreement from such third party to Capricor. The minimum annual royalties are creditable against future royalty payments.
​
The Rome License Agreement will, unless extended or sooner terminated, remain in effect until the later of the last claim of any patent or until any patent application comprising licensed patent rights has expired or been abandoned. Under the terms of the Rome License Agreement, either party may terminate the agreement should the other party become insolvent or file a petition in bankruptcy. Either party may terminate the agreement upon the other party’s material breach, provided that the breaching party will have up to 90 days to cure its material breach. Capricor may also terminate for any reason upon 90 days’ written notice to the University of Rome.

The Johns Hopkins University License Agreements
License Agreement for CDCs
Capricor and JHU entered into an Exclusive License Agreement, effective June 22, 2006 (the “JHU License Agreement”), which provides for the grant of an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license by JHU to Capricor (with the right to sublicense) to develop and commercialize licensed products and licensed services under the licensed patent rights in all fields and a nonexclusive right to the know-how. Various amendments were entered into to revise certain provisions of the JHU License Agreement. Under the JHU License Agreement, Capricor is required to exercise commercially reasonable and diligent efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products covered by the licenses from JHU.
​
Pursuant to the JHU License Agreement, JHU was paid an initial license fee and, thereafter, Capricor is required to pay minimum annual royalties on the anniversary dates of the JHU License Agreement. The minimum annual royalties are creditable against a low single-digit running royalty on net sales of products and net service revenues, which Capricor is also required to pay under the JHU License Agreement, which running royalty may be subject to further reduction in the event that Capricor is required to pay royalties on any patent rights to third parties in order to make or sell a licensed product. In addition, Capricor is required to pay a low double-digit percentage of the consideration received by it from sublicenses granted and is required to pay JHU certain defined development milestone payments upon the successful completion of certain phases of its clinical studies and upon receiving approval from the FDA. The maximum aggregate amount of milestone payments payable under the JHU License Agreement, as amended, is $1,850,000. In March 2022, Capricor paid the $250,000 development milestone related to the Phase II study pursuant to the terms of the JHU License Agreement. The next milestone is triggered upon successful completion of a full Phase III study for which a payment of $500,000 will be due. 
​
The JHU License Agreement will, unless sooner terminated, continue in effect in each applicable country until the date of expiration of the last to expire patent within the patent rights, or, if no patents are issued, then for twenty years from the effective date. Under the terms of the JHU License Agreement, either party may terminate the agreement should the other party become insolvent or file a petition in bankruptcy or fail to cure a material breach within 30 days after notice. In addition, Capricor may terminate for any reason upon 60 days’ written notice.
​
License Agreement for Exosome-based Vaccines and Therapeutics
Capricor and JHU entered into an Exclusive License Agreement (the “JHU Exosome License Agreement”), effective April 28, 2021 for its co-owned interest in certain intellectual property rights related to exosome-mRNA vaccines and therapeutics. The JHU Exosome License Agreement provides for the grant of an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license of JHU’s co-owned rights by JHU to Capricor, with the right to sublicense, in order to conduct research using the patent rights and know-how and to develop and commercialize products in the field using the patent rights and know-how.
​
Pursuant to the JHU Exosome License Agreement, JHU was paid an upfront license fee of $10,000 and Capricor has agreed to reimburse JHU for certain fees and costs incurred in connection with the prosecution of certain patent rights.
​
Additionally, Capricor is required to meet certain development milestones for which a milestone payment fee shall be due and is obligated to pay low single-digit royalties on sales of royalty-bearing products as well as a double-digit percentage of any non-royalty consideration received from any sublicenses, subject to certain exclusions. The above-mentioned royalties are subject to reduction in the event Capricor becomes obligated to pay royalties on one or more third party patents as a requirement to make or sell a licensed product. In addition, Capricor will, beginning with the third year of the JHU Exosome License Agreement, be obligated to pay JHU a minimum annual royalty which is non-refundable but will be credited against royalties incurred by Capricor for the year in which the minimum annual royalty becomes due.
​
The JHU Exosome License Agreement will, unless sooner terminated, continue in each country until the date of expiration of the last to expire patent included within the patent rights in that country, or if no patents issue, then for 20 years. The JHU Exosome License Agreement may be terminated by Capricor upon 90 days’ written notice in its discretion and with 60 days’ notice with respect to any particular patent or application or as to any particular licensed product. The JHU Exosome License Agreement may also be terminated by either party if the other party fails to perform or otherwise 

14




breaches any of its obligations and fails to cure such breach within a 60-day cure period commencing upon notice. A material breach by Capricor may include (a) a delinquency with respect to payment or reporting; (b) the failure by Capricor to timely achieve a specified milestone or otherwise failing to diligently develop, commercialize, and sell licensed products throughout the term of the JHU Exosome License Agreement; (c) non-compliance with record keeping or audit obligations; (d) voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency of Capricor; and (e) non-compliance with Capricor’s insurance obligations. 
​
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center License Agreements
License Agreement for CDCs
On January 4, 2010, Capricor entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with CSMC (the “Original CSMC License Agreement”), for certain intellectual property related to its CDC technology. In 2013, the Original CSMC License Agreement was amended twice resulting in, among other things, a reduction in the percentage of sublicense fees which would have been payable to CSMC. Effective December 30, 2013, Capricor entered into an Amended and Restated Exclusive License Agreement with CSMC (the “Amended CSMC License Agreement”), which amended, restated, and superseded the Original CSMC License Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, certain definitions were added or amended, the timing of certain obligations was revised and other obligations of the parties were clarified.
The Amended CSMC License Agreement provides for the grant of an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license by CSMC to Capricor (with the right to sublicense) to conduct research using the patent rights and know-how and develop and commercialize products in the field using the patent rights and know-how. In addition, Capricor has the exclusive right to negotiate for an exclusive license to any future rights arising from related work conducted by or under the direction of Dr. Eduardo Marbán on behalf of CSMC. In the event the parties fail to agree upon the terms of an exclusive license for any future rights, Capricor will have a non-exclusive license to such future rights, subject to royalty obligations.
Pursuant to the Original CSMC License Agreement, CSMC was paid a license fee and Capricor was obligated to reimburse CSMC for certain fees and costs incurred in connection with the prosecution of certain patent rights. Additionally, Capricor is required to meet certain spending and development milestones.
Pursuant to the Amended CSMC License Agreement, Capricor remains obligated to pay low single-digit royalties on sales of royalty-bearing products as well as a low double-digit percentage of the consideration received from any sublicenses or other grant of rights. The above-mentioned royalties are subject to reduction in the event Capricor becomes obligated to obtain a license from a third party for patent rights in connection with the royalty-bearing product. 
The Amended CSMC License Agreement will, unless sooner terminated, continue in effect on a country by country basis until the last to expire of the patents covering the patent rights or future patent rights. Under the terms of the Amended CSMC License Agreement, unless waived by CSMC, the agreement shall automatically terminate: (i) if Capricor ceases, dissolves or winds up its business operations; (ii) in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of Capricor or if Capricor makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (iii) if performance by either party jeopardizes the licensure, accreditation or tax exempt status of CSMC or the agreement is deemed illegal by a governmental body; (iv) within 30 days for non-payment of royalties; (v) after 90 days’ notice from CSMC if Capricor fails to undertake commercially reasonable efforts to exploit the patent rights or future patent rights; (vi) if a material breach has not been cured within 90 days; or (vii) if Capricor challenges any of the CSMC patent rights. If Capricor fails to undertake commercially reasonable efforts to exploit the patent rights or future patent rights, and fails to cure that breach after 90 days’ notice from CSMC, instead of terminating the license, CSMC has the option to convert any exclusive license to Capricor to a non-exclusive or co-exclusive license. Capricor may terminate the agreement if CSMC fails to cure any material breach within 90 days after notice.
On March 20, 2015, August 5, 2016, December 26, 2017, June 20, 2018, and July 27, 2021, Capricor and CSMC entered into a number of amendments to the Amended CSMC License Agreement, pursuant to which the parties agreed to add and delete certain patent applications from the list of scheduled patents, among other things. Capricor reimbursed CSMC for certain attorneys’ fees and filing fees incurred in connection with the additional patent applications.
License Agreement for Exosomes
On May 5, 2014, Capricor entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with CSMC (the “Exosomes License Agreement”), for certain intellectual property rights related to CDC-derived exosomes technology. The Exosomes License 

15




Agreement provides for the grant of an exclusive, world-wide, royalty-bearing license by CSMC to Capricor (with the right to sublicense) in order to conduct research using the patent rights and know-how and to develop and commercialize products in the field using the patent rights and know-how. In addition, Capricor has the exclusive right to negotiate for an exclusive license to any future rights arising from related work conducted by or under the direction of Dr. Eduardo Marbán on behalf of CSMC. In the event the parties fail to agree upon the terms of an exclusive license, Capricor shall have a non-exclusive license to such future rights, subject to royalty obligations.
Pursuant to the Exosomes License Agreement, CSMC was paid a license fee and Capricor reimbursed CSMC for certain fees and costs incurred in connection with the preparation and prosecution of certain patent applications. Additionally, Capricor is required to meet certain non-monetary development milestones and is obligated to pay low single-digit royalties on sales of royalty-bearing products as well as a single-digit percentage of the consideration received from any sublicenses or other grant of rights. The above-mentioned royalties are subject to reduction in the event Capricor becomes obligated to obtain a license from a third party for patent rights in connection with the royalty bearing product.
The Exosomes License Agreement will, unless sooner terminated, continue in effect on a country by country basis until the last to expire of the patents covering the patent rights or future patent rights. Under the terms of the Exosomes License Agreement, unless waived by CSMC, the agreement shall automatically terminate: (i) if Capricor ceases, dissolves or winds up its business operations; (ii) in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of Capricor or if Capricor makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (iii) if performance by either party jeopardizes the licensure, accreditation or tax exempt status of CSMC or the agreement is deemed illegal by a governmental body; (iv) within 30 days for non-payment of royalties; (v) after 90 days if Capricor fails to undertake commercially reasonable efforts to exploit the patent rights or future patent rights; (vi) if a material breach has not been cured within 90 days; or (vii) if Capricor challenges any of the CSMC patent rights. If Capricor fails to undertake commercially reasonable efforts to exploit the patent rights or future patent rights and fails to cure that breach after 90 days’ notice from CSMC, instead of terminating the license, CSMC has the option to convert any exclusive license to Capricor to a non-exclusive or co-exclusive license. Capricor may terminate the agreement if CSMC fails to cure any material breach within 90 days after notice.
On February 27, 2015, June 10, 2015, August 5, 2016, December 26, 2017, June 20, 2018, September 25, 2018, August 19, 2020, August 28, 2020, and March 19, 2021, Capricor and CSMC entered into a number of amendments to the Exosomes License Agreement. Collectively, these amendments added additional patent applications and patent families to the Exosomes License Agreement, added certain defined product development milestone payments, modified certain milestone deadlines, and added certain performance milestones with respect to product candidates covered by certain future patent rights in order to maintain an exclusive license to those future patent rights; failure to meet those milestones would cause CSMC to have the right to convert the license from exclusive to non-exclusive or co-exclusive, or to terminate the license, subject to Capricor’s right to license such patent rights for internal research purposes on a non-exclusive basis. These amendments also obligated Capricor to reimburse CSMC for certain attorneys’ fees and filing fees in connection with the additional patent applications and patent families.
Sponsored Research Agreement with Johns Hopkins University 
On April 1, 2020 we entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement (the “SRA”) with JHU pursuant to which researchers in the lab of Dr. Stephen Gould performed certain research activities in connection with our engineered exosomes program. Pursuant to the SRA, we funded certain research activities. This SRA expired in accordance with its terms on March 31, 2022.
Cell Line License Agreement with Life Technologies
On March 7, 2022, Capricor entered into a non-exclusive cell line license agreement with Life Technologies Corporation, a subsidiary of Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., for the supply of certain cells which we will use in connection with the development of our exosomes platform. An initial license fee payment was made in the first quarter of 2022 and additional milestone fees may become due on the progress of our development program.
Manufacturing
Capricor currently maintains two manufacturing facilities. We recently completed construction in our San Diego Research and Development Facility of a new GMP pilot manufacturing facility as we prepare for potential commercial launch. This facility is being designed to be compliant with U.S., European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), and other 

16




international standards. This facility is designed to produce commercial-scale GMP CAP-1002 product for further clinical and potential commercial use. 
Our second manufacturing facility is located within our laboratory and research and manufacturing facilities located at CSMC pursuant to a Facilities Lease. In that portion of the leased premises where we manufacture CAP-1002 and may manufacture our exosome products for potential clinical use, we believe that we follow, current good manufacturing practices, to the extent that they are applicable to the stage of our clinical programs although our current facility does not meet commercial current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) standards. The CSMC manufacturing facility is licensed by the California Department of Public Health Food and Drug Branch to manufacture drugs. Capricor has been manufacturing CAP-1002 in this facility for our current and previous studies including the HOPE-3 trial, although we are planning to potentially use product from our San Diego facility to support the ongoing HOPE-3 trial. Our Facilities Lease has an expiration date of July 31, 2024. At this time, we are considering the possible extension of our current Facilities Lease. 
We are required to obtain and maintain other certain licenses in connection with our manufacturing facilities and activities. We have also been issued a Manufacturing License and a Tissue Bank License from the State of California. 
Additionally, we initiated a technology transfer with Lonza Houston, Inc., a leading global contract manufacturing organization to prepare for the possibility of commercial launch to support product demand, as needed, for manufacturing of CAP-1002. Process development and cGMP readiness have been the focus of the work done by Lonza to date. We are evaluating whether it would be in our best interests to have Lonza move forward to complete the technology transfer process at this time. The next steps will be based on many factors, including our ability to produce GMP CAP-1002 product from our facility in San Diego as well as our discussions with regulatory agencies.
Manufacturing Process for CAP-1002
The manufacturing process for CAP-1002 begins with material from an entire heart from a donor that was collected from an organ procurement organization (“OPO”). This tissue is then taken to the lab where the cells are isolated, expanded, and processed through a series of proprietary unit operations. After expanding, processing, release testing and quality review, the CAP-1002 product becomes available for administration to patients participating in clinical trials. CAP-1002 is cryo-preserved, enabling us to produce large lots that can be frozen and then administered to patients as needed.
​
Manufacturing Process for Engineered-Exosome Technologies
We have also made significant progress planning the next steps for the manufacturing process for our exosome product candidates. We believe these developments will enable us to scale up our manufacturing capabilities and allow us to manufacture enough material for early-stage clinical development. We are exploring the use of various cell sources to generate our exosomes for preclinical and potential clinical use.
Manufacturing Process for CDC-Exosomes (CAP-2003)
The process for manufacturing CAP-2003 starts with the proprietary process of creating a cell bank from donor heart tissue through the expansion of CDCs. Afterwards, exosomes are isolated from the expanded CDCs. After these exosomes are prepared, formulated, filled, tested, and validated, the exosomes product becomes available for clinical investigation, subject to regulatory approval. 
Research and Development
Capricor’s research and development program has been advanced in part through federal and state grants and loan awards totaling approximately $28 million to date. Our ongoing research and development activities primarily concern CDCs and exosomes and are focused on the characterization of their composition and actions, the evaluation of their therapeutic potential in selected disease settings, the development of next generation product candidates, and the identification of new technologies and indications.

17




Competition
We are engaged in fields that are characterized by extensive worldwide research and competition by pharmaceutical companies, medical device companies, specialized biotechnology companies, hospitals, physicians and academic institutions, both in the United States and abroad. This competition is particularly intense for products involving the treatment or prevention of diseases associated with COVID-19. The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, with a number of established, large pharmaceutical companies, as well as many smaller companies. Many of the organizations competing with us have substantially greater financial resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities, longer drug development history in obtaining regulatory approvals, and greater manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do. There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities, government agencies, and research organizations actively engaged in research and development of products which may target the same indications as our product candidates. We expect any future products and product candidates we develop to compete on the basis of, among other things, product efficacy and safety, time to market, price, extent of adverse side effects, and convenience of treatment procedures. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to rapid and significant technological change. The drugs that we are attempting to develop will have to compete with existing and future therapies. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to evolving cell therapy and exosome technologies. There can be no assurance that existing or future therapies developed by others will not render our potential products obsolete or noncompetitive. In addition, companies pursuing different but related fields represent substantial competition. These organizations also compete with us to attract patients for clinical trials, qualified personnel and parties for acquisitions, joint ventures, or other collaborations.
Government Regulation
The research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, serialization and tracking, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and export and import, among other things, of our product candidates are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve a pending NDA or a pending BLA, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution. We would also be facing additional regulations and requirements from regulatory authorities in other countries outside the U.S. if we seek approval of our product candidates for sale or distribution within such countries. 
FDA Approval Process for Drugs and Biologics
Pharmaceutical products, including biological products such as ours, may not be commercially marketed without prior approval from the FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in other countries. In the United States, the process for receiving such approval is long, expensive and risky, and includes the following steps:

● | preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an IRB at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an NDA, for a drug, or BLA, for a biological product;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a potential FDA audit of the preclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the ability to obtain clearance or approval of companion diagnostic tests, if required, on a timely basis, or at all;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18





● | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sponsors submit NDAs in order to obtain marketing approval for drugs. Sponsors submit BLAs in order to obtain marketing approval for biologics, which include, among other product classes, vaccines.
Regulation by U.S. and foreign governmental authorities is a significant factor affecting our ability to commercialize any of our products, as well as the timing of such commercialization and our ongoing research and development activities. The commercialization of drug products requires regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. Various laws and regulations govern or influence the research and development, non-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, processing, packaging, validation, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, registration, listing, distribution, advertising, sale, marketing and post-marketing commitments of our products. The lengthy process of seeking these approvals, and the subsequent compliance with applicable laws and regulations, require expending substantial resources.
The results of preclinical testing, which include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, toxicity and carcinogenicity animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product and its formulations, details concerning the drug manufacturing process and its controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND that must be reviewed and become effective before clinical testing can begin. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) for approval covering each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. Once a sponsor submits an IND, the sponsor must wait 30 calendar days before initiating any clinical trials. If the FDA has comments or questions within this 30-day period, the issue(s) must be resolved to the satisfaction of the FDA before a clinical trial can begin. In addition, the FDA or IRB may impose a clinical hold on ongoing clinical trials if, among other things, it believes that a clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable and significant risk to clinical trial patients. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, clinical trials can only proceed under terms authorized by the FDA. If applicable, our preclinical and clinical studies must conform to the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”), and Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) requirements, respectively, which are designed to ensure the quality and integrity of submitted data and protect the rights and well-being of study patients. Information for certain clinical trials also must be publicly disclosed within certain time limits on the clinical trial registry and results databank maintained by the NIH.
Typically, clinical testing involves a three-phase process; however, the phases may overlap or be combined:

● | Phase I clinical trials typically are conducted in a small number of volunteers or patients to assess the early tolerability and safety profile, the pattern of drug absorption, distribution and metabolism, the mechanism of action in humans, and may include studies where investigational drugs are used as research to explore biological phenomena or disease processes;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase II clinical trials typically are conducted in a limited patient population with a specific disease in order to assess appropriate dosages and dose regimens, expand evidence of the safety profile and evaluate preliminary efficacy; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase III clinical trials typically are larger scale, multicenter, well-controlled trials conducted on patients with a specific disease to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A therapeutic product candidate being studied in clinical trials may be made available for treatment of individual patients, intermediate-size patient populations, or for widespread treatment use under an expanded access protocol, under certain circumstances. Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act (the “Cures Act”), which was signed into law in December 2016, the manufacturer of one or more investigational products for the diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of one or more serious diseases or conditions is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational product.
Additionally, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017 was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are 

19




undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA authorization under an FDA expanded access program; however, manufacturers are not obligated to provide investigational new drug products under the current federal right to try law.
The results of the preclinical and clinical testing, chemistry, manufacturing and control information, proposed labeling and other information are then submitted to the FDA in the form of either an NDA or BLA for review and potential approval to begin commercial sales. Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews an application submission to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any application that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the application. In responding to an NDA or BLA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, or issue a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”). A CRL generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of an NDA or BLA and may require substantial additional testing or information. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter, which authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications, and sometimes with specified post-marketing commitments and/or distribution and use restrictions imposed under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program. Any approval required from the FDA might not be obtained on a timely basis, if at all.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
Sponsors of certain clinical trials of FDA-regulated products are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial are then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
Orphan Drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to therapeutic candidates intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a therapeutic candidate for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that therapeutic candidate. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a marketing application for the therapeutic candidate for that particular disease or condition. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and an exemption from the NDA or BLA application fee. The FDA may revoke orphan drug designation, and if it does, it will publicize that the drug is no longer designated as an orphan drug.
If a therapeutic candidate with orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for such drug for the disease for which it has such designation, the therapeutic candidate is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same therapeutic candidate for the same indication, for seven years, unless the sponsor of the subsequent application demonstrates clinical superiority, in the form of a greater efficacy, greater safety, or a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, could also block the approval of one of our therapeutic candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains orphan drug designation and FDA approval of the same therapeutic candidate for the same condition or disease as our orphan-designated drug. For macromolecules, FDA considers a drug to be the same drug as an orphan-designated macromolecule if it contains the same principal molecular structural features, but not necessarily all of the same structural features.
In addition, as the FDA has interpreted the Orphan Drug Act, even if a previously approved same drug does not have unexpired orphan exclusivity, a demonstration of clinical superiority is required for a subsequent marketing application for the same orphan-designated drug for the same disease or condition to be awarded a 7-year period of orphan exclusivity upon marketing approval. In recent years, there have been multiple legal challenges to this FDA interpretation, 

20




and in August 2017, Congress amended the orphan drug provisions of the FDCA through enactment of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 to codify FDA’s longstanding interpretation. Section 527 of the FDCA now expressly provides that if a sponsor of an orphan-designated drug that is otherwise the same as an already approved drug for the same rare disease or condition is seeking orphan exclusivity, FDA shall require such sponsor to demonstrate that such drug is clinically superior to any already approved or licensed drug that is the same drug in order to obtain orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application FDA may revoke the Fast Track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Products may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval. Under the Breakthrough Therapy program, products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may be eligible for the benefits of the Fast Track program when preliminary clinical evidence demonstrates that such product may have substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. Additionally, FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product receives timely advice and interactive communications to help the sponsor design and conduct a development program as efficiently as possible.
A product is eligible for priority review if it is intended to treat a serious condition and, if approved, it would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. FDA intends to take action on a priority review marketing application within 6 months of filing, compared to 10 months of filing for regular review submissions.
Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and would provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments. Eligible products may receive accelerated approval on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality and is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity, mortality, or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval diligently perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies demonstrating clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA requires as a condition for accelerated approval the submission of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for full approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapies (RMAT) Designation
The FDA has established a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”) designation as part of its implementation of the Cures Act. The RMAT designation program is intended to fulfill the Cures Act requirement that the FDA facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of, any drug that meets the following criteria: (1) it qualifies as a RMAT, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, with limited exceptions; (2) it is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and (3) preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. Like breakthrough therapy designation, RMAT designation provides potential benefits that include more frequent meetings with FDA to discuss the development plan for the product candidate, and eligibility for rolling review and priority review. Products granted RMAT 

21




designation may also be eligible for accelerated approval on the basis of a surrogate or intermediate endpoint reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites, including through expansion to additional sites. RMAT-designated products that receive accelerated approval may, as appropriate, fulfill their post-approval requirements through the submission of clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real-world evidence (such as electronic health records); through the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or via post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to approval of the therapy.
Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher
The FDA generally defines a “rare pediatric disease” as a serious or life-threatening disease that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. primarily under the age of 18 years old. Under the FDA's Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV) program, upon the approval of an application for a product for the treatment of a rare pediatric disease, the sponsor of such application is eligible for a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher. Currently, the Priority Review Voucher can be used to obtain priority review for any subsequent application and may be sold or transferred an unlimited number of times. Congress has only authorized the rare pediatric disease priority review voucher program until September 30, 2024. However, if a drug candidate receives Rare Pediatric Disease designation before September 30, 2024, it is eligible to receive a voucher if it is approved before September 30, 2026.
Post-Approval Requirements
FDA Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
Oftentimes, even after a drug has been approved by the FDA for sale, the FDA may require that certain post-approval requirements be satisfied, including the conduct of additional clinical studies. If such post-approval requirements are not satisfied, the FDA may withdraw its approval of the drug. In addition, holders of an approved NDA or BLA are required to report certain adverse reactions to the FDA, comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products, and continue to have quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP after approval. In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Among the conditions for an NDA or BLA approval is the requirement that the manufacturing operations conform on an ongoing basis with cGMP. In complying with cGMP, we must expend time, money and effort in the areas of training, production and quality control within our own organization and at our contract manufacturing facilities. A successful inspection of the manufacturing facility by the FDA is usually a prerequisite for final approval of a pharmaceutical product. Following approval of the NDA or BLA, we and our manufacturers will remain subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and the conditions of approval. We will also face similar inspections coordinated by foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA periodically inspects the sponsor’s records related to safety reporting and/or manufacturing facilities; this latter effort includes assessment of compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing 

22




processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under an REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, including total or partial suspension of production, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability.
In addition, the distribution of prescription drug products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (the “PDMA”) which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription drug product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
Pricing, Coverage and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any of our products, if and when approved. Sales of pharmaceutical products depend, in part, on the availability of sufficient coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, which include government health programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and the Veterans Administration, as well as commercial insurance, and managed healthcare organizations. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our therapeutic product candidates may be subject to challenge, reduction, or denial by payors. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or another alternative is available. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. 
The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply reimbursement will be available at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, and sales and distribution costs. Additionally, in the United States there is no uniform policy among payors for determining coverage or reimbursement. Many third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval processes. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will likely be a time-consuming process. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available, or are available only at limited levels, successful commercialization of, and obtaining a satisfactory financial return on, any product we develop may not be possible.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for marketing, we may need to conduct expensive studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, which would be in addition to the costs expended to obtain regulatory approvals. Third-party payors may not consider our product candidates to be medically necessary or cost-effective compared to other available therapies, or payor negotiations may not enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products once 

23




approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products once approved or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our products could reduce or eliminate utilization of our products and have an adverse effect on our sales, results of operations, and financial condition.
Additionally, efforts to contain healthcare costs (including drug prices) have become a priority of federal and state governments. The U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution by generic products. There has also been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. We anticipate additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future. These may include price controls and cost-containment measures, or more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and potentially could reduce demand for our products once approved, create additional pricing pressures, or ultimately limit our net revenue and results.
In addition, in some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a product candidate must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our product candidates. Historically, product candidates launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally tend to have price structures that are significantly lower.
Other Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws
Although we currently do not have any products on the market, our activities, including current and future arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors and customers, may be subject to additional healthcare laws, regulations and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, price reporting, and physician sunshine laws. Some of our pre-commercial activities also may be subject to some of these laws.
The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer or a party acting on its behalf, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between therapeutic product manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers, among others, on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common business activities from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending of products or services reimbursable under federal healthcare programs may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act” or the “ACA”), to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, 

24




the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in civil monetary penalties up to $100,000 (adjusted for inflation) for each violation, plus up to three times the total amount of remuneration between the parties to the arrangement. Civil penalties for such conduct can further be assessed under the federal False Claims Act. Violations can also result in criminal penalties, including criminal fines of up to $100,000 (adjusted for inflation) and imprisonment of up to 10 years. Similarly, violations can result in exclusion from participation or suspension from future participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.
The U.S. federal civil False Claims Act, prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed. Persons and entities can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, certain of our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information, and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Penalties for federal civil False Claims Act violations may include up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $13,508 and $27,018 for each separate false claim per false claim or statement for penalties assessed after January 30, 2023 with respect to violations occurring after November 2, 2015 (and penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 per claim or statement with respect to violations occurring before that date). Other penalties include the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Additionally, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, False Claims Act violations may also implicate various federal criminal statutes.
There is also the U.S. federal criminal False Claims Act, which is similar to the federal civil False Claims Act and imposes criminal liability on those that make or present a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government. The Federal Criminal Statute on False Statements Relating to Health Care Matters makes it a crime to knowingly and willfully falsify, conceal, or cover up a material fact, make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations, or make or use any materially false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services.
The U.S. Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law (the “CMPL") authorizes the imposition of substantial monetary penalties against an entity, such as a pharmaceutical manufacturer, that engaged in activities including, among others (1) knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a claim for services not provided as claimed or that is otherwise false or fraudulent in any way; (2) arranging for or contracting with an individual or entity that is excluded from participation in federal health care programs to provide items or services reimbursable by a federal health care program; (3) violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute; or (4) failing to report and return a known overpayment.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, the ACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors, or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages 

25




or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. Regulatory guidance and obligations continue to evolve. For example, on December 10, 2020, the Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”) issued a proposed rule aimed at reducing regulatory burdens that may exist in discouraging coordination of care, among other changes. Finally, pursuant to legislation passed in 2021, OCR recently issued guidance on recognized security practices for covered entities and business associates. OCR indicated that recognized security practices will not be an aggravating factor in OCR investigations, but that implementation of recognized security practices strengthen an organization’s cybersecurity and regulatory posture, as well as possibly lessening enforcement penalties in a potential regulatory enforcement. As HIPAA requirements evolve, we may be required to update our compliance strategies or modify our business processes to comply.
The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and many state attorneys general are interpreting existing federal and state consumer protection laws to impose evolving standards for the collection, use, dissemination and security of health-related and other personal information. Privacy laws require us to publish statements that describe how we handle personal information and choices individuals may have about the way we handle their personal information. Violating individuals’ privacy rights, publishing false or misleading information about security practices, or failing to take appropriate steps to keep individuals’ personal information secure may constitute unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act. Additionally, the FTC recently published an advance notice of proposed rule making on “commercial surveillance” and data security, and is seeking comment on whether it should implement new trade regulation rules or other regulatory alternatives concerning the ways in which companies (1) collect, aggregate, protect, use, analyze, and retain consumer data, as well as (2) transfer, share, sell, or otherwise monetize that data in ways that are unfair or deceptive. Federal regulators, state attorneys general and plaintiffs’ attorneys have been and will likely continue to be active in this space, and if we do not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to patient health information, we could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions.
In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted by HIPAA, and may have a more prohibitive effect than HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. For instance, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) became effective on January 1, 2020, giving California residents expanded privacy rights, and requiring businesses provide detailed information about their data practices. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Although there are limited exemptions for PHI and certain clinical trial data, the CCPA’s implementation standards and enforcement practices may increase our compliance costs and legal risks. Additionally, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) was passed in November 2020 and amended the CCPA beginning in 2023. The CPRA imposes additional data protection obligations on companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It also created a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. Similar laws have been adopted in other states or proposed in other states and at the federal level, and if passed, such laws may have potentially conflicting requirements that would make compliance challenging. For example, the Nevada Privacy of Information Collected on the Internet from Consumers Act went into effect on October 1, 2021, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act went into effect on January 1, 2023, the Colorado Privacy Act goes into effect on July 1, 2023, the Connecticut Data Privacy Act goes into effect July 1, 2023, and the Utah Consumer Privacy Act goes into effect December 31, 2023. Additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required to respond to these rapidly changing privacy law landscape. If we fail to comply with existing or new privacy laws and regulations, we could face legal liability from regulatory actions or litigation, as well as reputational damage.
Additionally, the U.S. federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act (the “Sunshine Act”), created under the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified nurse anesthetists, certified nurse-midwives and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 (adjusted annually for inflation) per year and up to an aggregate of $1,000,000 (adjusted annually for inflation) per year for “knowing failures.” Covered manufacturers are required to submit reports on aggregate payment data to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on an annual basis. 

26




Many states have similar statutes or regulations to the above federal laws that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor. We may also be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, and/or state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, drug pricing or marketing expenditures. These laws may differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, further complicating compliance efforts. Additionally, to the extent that we have business operations in foreign countries or sell any of our products in foreign countries and jurisdictions, including Japan or the European Union, we may be subject to additional regulations.
Although we do not currently have any products on the market, once our product candidates or clinical trials are covered by federal health care programs, we will be subject to additional healthcare statutory and regulatory requirements and enforcement by the federal and state governments of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Because we intend to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we intend to develop a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal controls to facilitate adherence to the rules and program requirements to which we will or may become subject. Although the development and implementation of compliance programs can mitigate the risk of violating these laws, and the subsequent investigation, prosecution, and penalties assessed for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject, without limitation, to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional oversight and reporting obligations pursuant to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
Additionally, we expect our products, if and when approved, may be eligible for coverage under Medicare, the federal health care program that provides health care benefits to the aged and disabled, and covers outpatient services and supplies, including certain pharmaceutical products, that are medically necessary to treat a beneficiary’s health condition. In addition, our products may be covered and reimbursed under other government programs, such as Medicaid and the 340B Drug Pricing Program. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, the manufacturer must extend discounts to statutorily defined covered entities that participate in the program. As part of the requirements to participate in certain government programs, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average manufacturer price (“AMP”) and best price. Penalties may apply in some cases when such metrics are not submitted accurately and timely.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to healthcare systems that could affect our future results of operations. 
In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of healthcare reform efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative and regulatory initiatives, including the ACA, which has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant impact on the healthcare industry. This law was designed to expand access to health insurance coverage for uninsured and underinsured individuals while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA contains provisions that may potentially affect the profitability of our products, including, for example, subjecting biologics potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars, increased rebates for products sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain products under Medicare Part D, expansion of entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service’s pharmaceutical pricing program, and a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import certain branded prescription drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may affect our business practices with healthcare providers and entities.

Additionally, there have been executive, judicial, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, while Congress has not passed legislation to comprehensively repeal the ACA, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act included a provision that, effective January 1, 2019, changed to $0 the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, which is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” Additionally, in March 2021, Congress enacted the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which included among its provisions a temporary increase in premium tax credit assistance for individuals eligible to receive qualified health plan premium subsidies for 2021 and 2022 and temporarily removed the 400% federal poverty level limit that otherwise applies for purposes of eligibility to receive premium such tax credits. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) extended this increased tax credit assistance and removal of the 400% federal poverty limit through 2025. Moreover, on June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden had issued an executive order that instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, policies that create barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplaces.
We cannot predict what effect the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal, amend or replace the ACA would have on our business.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 included reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislation, will stay in effect into 2031 (with the exception of a temporary suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 and a subsequent reduction to 1% from April 1, 2022 until June 30, 2022). To offset the temporary suspension during the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2030, reductions in Medicare payments will be 2.25% for the first half of the year, and 3% in the second half of the year. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. In the future, there may be additional challenges and/or amendments to the ACA. It remains to be seen precisely what any new legislation will provide, when or if it will be enacted, and what impact it may have on the availability and cost of healthcare items and services, including drug products.
In addition, in recent years the pricing and costs of prescription pharmaceuticals has been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States. A number of federal reports and inquiries have focused on these issues, and various legislative and regulatory provisions have been proposed and enacted at the federal and state level that seek to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the out-of-pocket cost of prescription drugs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. Additionally, on December 21, 2020, Congress passed a $900 billion U.S. coronavirus relief and government appropriations legislation, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, which contains several important new drug price reporting and transparency measures that could result in additional transparency with respect to manufacturers’ prescription drug prices. Among other things, the Act includes provisions requiring Medicare Part D prescription drug plan (the “PDP”) sponsors and Medicare Advantage organizations (“MAOs”) to implement tools to display Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit information in real time and provisions requiring group and health insurance issuers offering health insurance coverage to report information on certain pharmacy benefit and drug costs to the Secretaries of HHS, Labor, and the Treasury.
Further, the Biden Administration and Congress have each indicated that it will continue to pursue new legislative and administrative measures to control drug costs. For example, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 included among its provisions a sunset of the ACA’s cap on pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Under the ACA, manufacturers’ rebate liability was capped at 100% of the average manufacturer price for a covered outpatient drug. However, effective January 1, 2024, manufacturers’ Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rebate liability will no longer be capped, potentially resulting in a manufacturer paying more in Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rebates than it receives on the sale of certain covered outpatient drugs. Further, in August 2022, President Biden signed into law IRA, which implements substantial changes to the Medicare program, including drug pricing reforms and the creation of new Medicare inflation rebates. Namely, the IRA imposes inflation rebates on drug manufacturers for products reimbursed under Medicare Parts B and D if the prices of those products increase faster than inflation; implements changes to the Medicare Part D benefit that, beginning in 2025, will cap beneficiary annual out-of-pocket spending at $2,000, while imposing new discount obligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers; and, beginning in 2026, establishes a “maximum fair price” for a fixed number of high expenditure pharmaceutical and biological products covered under

Medicare Parts B and D following a price negotiation process with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Furthermore, the Biden administration continues to direct the Department of Health and Human Services HHS to consider new healthcare payment and delivery models that would lower drug costs and promote access to innovative therapies for beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. We cannot predict how, or to what extent, the Biden administration’s drug pricing policies will affect our products. We cannot predict what other healthcare reforms will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation. Accordingly, we face uncertainties that might result from additional reforms. 
At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control biopharmaceutical and biologic product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations will be changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be.
