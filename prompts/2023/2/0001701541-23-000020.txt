Item 1. Business
We are a clinical-stage precision oncology medicine company focused on pioneering the discovery and development of novel MasterKey therapies. We target families of oncogenic mutations in patients with genetically defined cancers. The foundation of our company is built upon a deep understanding of cancer genetics, onco-protein structure and function, and medicinal chemistry. Our proprietary technology platform, which we refer to as our Mutation-Allostery-Pharmacology (MAP) drug discovery engine, is designed to allow us to analyze population-level genetic sequencing data to discover oncogenic mutations that promote cancer across tumor types. Our goal is to identify families of mutations that can be inhibited with MasterKey therapies, thereby providing precision oncology to greater numbers of patients with genetically defined tumors.
We have designed our product candidates to be potent, brain penetrant and selective MasterKey inhibitors of oncogenic mutational families which occur across a range of tumor types. Our lead product candidate, BDTX-1535, is designed to selectively and irreversibly inhibit a family of oncogenic mutations in the ErbB-1 epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) which are resistant to current generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), while sparing wild type EGFR (EGFR WT) activity. We are currently evaluating BDTX-1535 in the dose escalation portion of a Phase 1 clinical trial in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR resistance mutations, with or without brain metastases, and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Our second product candidate, BDTX-4933, is designed to be a brain penetrant and highly selective and potent inhibitor of oncogenic BRAF Class I, II, III and active RAF dimers promoted by upstream oncogenic alterations, such as RAS mutations, which has the potential to avoid paradoxical activation. We expect to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial for BDTX-4933 in select indications for patients harboring all-class BRAF or RAS mutations in the first half of 2023. We are also leveraging our MAP drug discovery engine to identify other families of oncogenic mutations in validated oncogenes, which have the potential to expand the reach of MasterKey therapies. 
In order to focus on progressing our pipeline through important upcoming milestones for BDTX-1535 and BDTX-4933, as well as on our discovery efforts, in April 2022, we announced the discontinuation of the development of BDTX-189, our EGFR/HER2 Exon 20 targeted therapy. In December 2022, we announced the spinout of undisclosed early discovery stage antibody programs enabled by the MAP drug discovery engine into Launchpad Therapeutics, Inc. (Launchpad), a new company formed to exploit the MAP drug discovery engine for the discovery, development and commercialization of large molecule therapeutics.
Approved targeted therapies, such as kinase inhibitors, have transformed the treatment of cancers and demonstrated a significant benefit to certain patients by treating active site mutations in a single tumor type. Improved genetic sequencing of human cancers has led to the discovery of additional oncogenic genetic alterations. These genetic alterations were previously unaddressed, unsuccessfully targeted or overlooked. Our MAP drug discovery engine is designed to reveal the oncogenic nature of undrugged driver mutations and their associated protein conformations. We discover MasterKey therapies to target families of oncogenic driver mutations by exploiting their shared activating conformation. We believe our MasterKey approach offers a substantial opportunity to expand the number of patients who could benefit from precision oncology medicines.
Our proprietary MAP drug discovery engine is built on three central pillars and enables the discovery of MasterKey inhibitors:
•Mutations—Through comprehensive analysis of population-level genetic sequencing data, we identify oncogenic mutations among hundreds of unique alterations within a single gene. We use our algorithm as a machine-learning tool to predict the oncogenicity of various uncharacterized mutations, thereby isolating oncogenic driver mutations from those mutations that are not believed to cause cancer, and which are referred to as silent and passenger mutations.
•Allostery—We confirm the oncogenicity of the identified mutations through cell and tumor models and reveal how these mutations drive conformational changes in proteins. This enables us to group subsets of mutations into families based upon similar protein structures and shared selectivity profiles. 
•Pharmacology—Using these shared characteristics, we seek to develop single small molecule product candidates, which we call MasterKey inhibitors, each designed to inhibit an entire family of oncogenic mutations. 
Our pipeline 
Utilizing our proprietary MAP drug discovery engine, we are building a pipeline of orally available, potent and selective small molecule MasterKey inhibitors that target families of driver mutations in individual oncogenes for the treatment of cancer. An overview of our pipeline of product candidates is shown in the table below. 
BDTX-1535: a brain penetrant, mutant selective, irreversible EGFR MasterKey inhibitor
In NSCLC, EGFR inhibitors have demonstrated significant clinical benefit in patients with primary EGFR activating mutations and are the current first-line standard of care. However, over time, almost all patients acquire resistance and relapse. Furthermore, up to half of all NSCLC patients either have central nervous system (CNS) metastases at diagnosis or will develop them while on treatment, which contributes to increased resistance and a poor prognosis. The majority of first- and second-generation EGFR inhibitors do not adequately penetrate the CNS. While osimertinib displays some CNS penetration and delays the progression of CNS metastases, there are few options remaining to patients when resistance inevitably arises.
GBM is a difficult-to-treat, aggressive malignancy of the central nervous system. Standard therapy at diagnosis consists of surgical resection followed by radiation and chemotherapy, but prognosis remains poor, with only approximately 25% of newly diagnosed patients surviving two years or longer after diagnosis. Almost 50% of GBM tumors express one or more EGFR oncogenic alterations that affect the extracellular region of the receptor tyrosine kinase, consequently promoting oncogenic activation. We believe that current targeted therapies have been unsuccessful in treating GBM due to (i) the concurrent expression of different EGFR oncogenic alterations within individual patients, (ii) insufficient drug potency across different EGFR oncogenic alterations, (iii) paradoxical activation of mutant EGFR commonly found in GBM by earlier generation inhibitors, and (iv) low levels of brain penetration. In preclinical models, we have shown that the mechanism of activation for these EGFR oncogenic alterations involves the formation of a constitutive dimer that exhibits a conformation, leading to ligand-independent signaling shared by a family of extracellular domain EGFR alterations expressed in GBM.
BDTX-1535 is designed to be a potent, selective, irreversible, oral and brain penetrant small molecule inhibitor that targets families of EGFR oncogenic alterations. In preclinical studies, we have observed BDTX-1535 to inhibit a family of classical driver (Ex19del, L858R), intrinsic resistance (Exon18, Exon 21, and others), and acquired resistance (C797S associated with resistance to third generation EGFR inhibitors) EGFR mutations expressed in NSCLC patients. In other preclinical studies, BDTX-1535 has demonstrated inhibition of EGFR alterations commonly found in patients with GBM that promote a constitutive dimer without paradoxical activation. As such, BDTX-1535 has the potential to fill a critical need for a brain penetrant inhibitor that addresses the limitations of other EGFR directed therapies.
The IND for BDTX-1535 was cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the first quarter of 2022, and we also initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial in the first quarter of 2022. BDTX-1535 is currently being evaluated in the dose escalation portion of a Phase 1 clinical trial in GBM patients and NSCLC patients with EGFR resistance mutations, with or without brain metastases. We expect to provide an update on clinical data from the Phase 1 clinical trial in the second half of 2023.
BDTX-4933: a highly selective, brain penetrant RAF MasterKey inhibitor 
BRAF mutations are among the most common mutations found in tumors. First-generation BRAF inhibitors have focused on V600E (Class I) mutations, but are not active against non-canonical oncogenic BRAF mutations. Non-canonical oncogenic mutations, including BRAF-fusions, can drive RAS-independent (Class II) or RAS-dependent (Class III) RAF dimers. In addition, current BRAF inhibitors can induce unwanted paradoxical activation that limits their breadth of activity and can result in cutaneous toxicity. Furthermore, the expression of BRAF mutations commonly occurs in patients with CNS tumors or brain metastases, but currently approved BRAF inhibitors have poor intrinsic brain penetration. As such, there remains a high unmet clinical need for a broad mutation spectrum and CNS penetrant BRAF inhibitor to treat patients expressing BRAF mutations with a precision medicine therapy.
BDTX-4933 is designed to be a potent and selective, reversible oral inhibitor that targets broad families of oncogenic Class II/III BRAF and Class I BRAF V600 mutations, along with constitutively active RAF dimers resulting from other upstream oncogenic MAPK pathway alterations, such as RAS alterations. In preclinical models, we observed that BDTX-4933 achieved regression of tumors carrying BRAF Class I, II, and III mutations, NRAS alterations and demonstrated brain penetrant properties. 
The IND for BDTX-4933 was cleared by the FDA in the first quarter of 2023. We expect to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial for BDTX-4933 in select indications for patients harboring all-class BRAF or RAS mutations in the first half of 2023.
Early-stage programs 
We are also advancing our early-stage programs targeting families of oncogenic mutations in validated oncogenes developed utilizing our MAP drug discovery engine and expect to progress our program targeting FGFR2/3, as well as another undisclosed program, toward development candidate nomination in 2023.
Our strategy
Our vision is to build a differentiated, global biopharmaceutical company by discovering, developing, and commercializing novel precision medicines for every patient with genetically defined tumors. We are advancing the field of precision medicines through improved understanding of mutant protein conformations to (i) identify novel oncogenic driver mutations and (ii) target families of oncogenic mutations with individual MasterKey therapies. We believe our strategy will enable us to become an industry leader in precision oncology medicine and advance a portfolio of MasterKey therapies aimed at delivering safe and effective medicines to patients. The critical components of our strategy include: 
•Rapidly advance BDTX-1535 through early clinical development to address families of oncogenic alterations in patients with GBM and NSCLC. We believe that BDTX-1535 could offer an improved approach in GBM and NSCLC by virtue of its ability to penetrate the blood brain barrier and potently, selectively and irreversibly inhibit a broad spectrum of EGFR alterations. 
•Rapidly advance BDTX-4933 into early clinical development. We believe that BDTX-4933 could offer an improved approach to addressing oncogenic BRAF Class I, II, III and RAS mutations expressed in patients with or without tumors in the central nervous system.
•Expand our pipeline of potent and selective MasterKey inhibitors to fully exploit the potential of our proprietary MAP drug discovery engine. We believe that the general principles for mutation-driven conformational change that we have identified for our lead programs can be applied to other oncogenic proteins. We also believe that our MAP drug discovery engine has identified undrugged driver mutations for cancer and we intend to design and develop highly selective and potent inhibitors to block the activity of these oncogenic proteins. We are advancing several early-stage programs focused on targeting a range of driver mutations, including activating mutations outside of the active site. We believe that the lead molecules in our FGFR program could overcome the limitations of current therapies. Our FGFR molecules are designed to be potent and selective MasterKey inhibitors of FGFR2/3 mutations that spare FGFR1 and FGFR4, and to provide improved activity against gatekeeper mutations compared to currently approved pan-FGFR inhibitors. We expect our FGFR program and one other undisclosed program in solid tumors to progress towards development candidate nomination in 2023.
•Continue to invest in our proprietary MAP drug discovery engine to identify and characterize new mutation families. We plan to continue to innovate our MAP drug discovery engine to enable new insights and to accelerate our ability to identify mutational drivers. We will continue to enhance our proprietary computational algorithms by leveraging both our extensive in-house expertise in MasterKey inhibitors that target mutation families and our deep understanding of chemistry and computational technologies. By continuing to strengthen and expand our MAP drug discovery engine, we believe we can exploit the growing amount of genetic sequencing data to characterize mutations underlying human disease. In December 2022, we announced the spinout of undisclosed early discovery stage antibody programs enabled by the MAP drug discovery engine into Launchpad, a new company formed to exploit the MAP drug discovery engine for the discovery, development and commercialization of large molecule therapeutics.
•Selectively evaluate strategic partnerships that may maximize the potential of our pipeline and our proprietary MAP drug discovery engine. Given our potential to generate novel product candidates addressing a wide variety of cancers, we may consider and opportunistically enter into strategic partnerships around certain targets, product candidates and disease areas. These collaborations could advance and accelerate our development programs to maximize their market potential and expand our MAP drug discovery engine capabilities.

Background on and limitations of previous generations of targeted therapies 
Background on targeted therapies 
Cancer is a genetic disease that is caused by changes in DNA that control the way cells function, especially how they grow and divide, and has historically been diagnosed and treated based on a tumor’s organ site or tissue of origin. Oncogene addiction, which is the dependency of tumors on genetic drivers for their growth and survival advantage, has enabled the pharmacological development of targeted therapies that exploit this dependency. Recent advances in genetic sequencing and a better understanding of genetic alterations that drive cancers have facilitated more precise and histologically agnostic cancer drug development. 
These targeted therapies have transformed the treatment of some cancers by providing substantial clinical benefit and have emerged as an important part of standard of care for cancer patients. Worldwide sales of kinase inhibitors, one class of targeted therapies, exceeded $35 billion in 2019. Furthermore, patients with tumors driven by oncogene addiction typically show rapid and measurable tumor shrinkage when exposed to drugs targeting the relevant alteration. Such clinical responses can be dramatic enough in many cases to support expedited regulatory approval of these targeted therapies. Yet, a recent analysis found that less than fifteen percent of patients with metastatic cancer have tumors with genetic profiles that could make them eligible for treatment with an approved precision oncology medicine. 
Existing targeted therapies have been effective because they target genetically defined cancers driven by a single set of mutations. Genetic sequencing of tumors reveals that many mutations remain uncharacterized, suggesting that there are additional mutations that can lead to oncogene addiction. With its supplemental approval by the FDA in 2017, pembrolizumab, or Keytruda, was the first targeted oncology treatment approved for any solid tumor based on a molecular profile, regardless of the tumor’s site of origin. In 2018, larotrectinib, or Vitrakvi, was approved by the FDA for neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase, or NTRK, driven cancers, making it the first drug to be approved to treat a specific genetic alteration in a tissue agnostic fashion. We believe that these advancements represent a fundamental change in the development of targeted therapies and will increasingly lead to cancer being characterized for treatment in a genetic, rather than in a tissue-specific manner. 
Limitations of current targeted therapies
Current targeted therapies provide clinical benefit to patients expressing ATP-site mutations, but not to patients expressing other mutations. Numerous other mutations beyond the active site mutations are known to the oncology clinical and research community, but those other mutations are often not currently targeted by approved inhibitors. For example, while EGFR-targeted therapies, including erlotinib and osimertinib, have proven to be effective in patients with ATP-site mutations, limited response to these inhibitors has been observed when treating patients with cancers expressing other types of oncogenic EGFR driver mutations, including those expressed outside of the ATP site, such as EGFR exon 20 insertions, and extracellular domain mutations, such as EGFRvIII. There remains a significant unmet medical need for new drugs that can extend precision medicines to patients expressing non-ATP site or non-canonical mutations. The figure below depicts the oncogenic EGFR mutations, shown in magenta. These include the ATP-site mutations, EGFR exon 19 deletions and L858R (left panel), as well as an additional spectrum of mutations occurring outside of the ATP site, including EGFRvIII (middle panel) and EGFR-L861X (right panel).
Emergence of genetic sequencing as standard of care in treating cancer 
The cancer treatment landscape is rapidly evolving, and there is now widespread recognition that cancer is a disease of genetics, as much as it is a disease defined by histology or anatomical location. This shift has been driven by the increased use of genetic sequencing coupled with the availability of approved targeted therapies. The FDA has approved Foundation Medicine’s comprehensive genetic profiling test FoundationOne CDx and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services announced coverage of next generation genetic sequencing tests, which we believe will further drive the use of genetic testing. A 2019 study demonstrated that 75% of oncologists in the United States employ genetic sequencing. As technological advancements in genetic sequencing improve and an increasing number of targeted therapies are developed, we believe that physicians will require molecular information about their patients’ cancers to determine the optimal course of treatment. Not only have advances in genetic sequencing changed the standard of care for oncology patients, but they are also leading to transformations in the discovery and development of oncology drugs. 
We believe that genetic sequencing enables the discovery of additional targets for drug development. More than 400 cancer-associated genes are routinely sequenced, and analysis of this data has shown that mutations are not restricted to specific regions, but rather are spread more broadly throughout entire sequences of genes. We believe that such mutations have not yet been systematically studied as potential drug targets or their oncogenic proteins targeted in drug discovery efforts, and that our ability to do so represents a significant opportunity to develop precision medicines in areas of major unmet medical need.
The Black Diamond Therapeutics approach 
At Black Diamond Therapeutics, our goal is to bring precision oncology medicine to patients with genetically defined cancers who have limited treatment options. Our drug development efforts leverage our novel findings that: 
•mutations throughout a gene can drive oncogenic activation and change the drug selectivity profile of their active sites; 
•these oncogenic mutations can be grouped into families because they drive similar protein structural changes, and exhibit a shared selectivity profile; and 
•a family of oncogenic proteins can therefore be inhibited by a single molecule that targets the active site regardless of where it appears on the receptor. 
We believe we can address certain key limitations of current generation precision medicine therapies in oncology by applying our MAP drug discovery engine to identify and target novel classes of oncogenic mutations. We believe this enables us to design and develop potential therapies for patients for whom there are currently no targeted treatment options. 
Our MAP drug discovery engine 
Our MAP drug discovery engine is built on three central pillars: Mutation—Allostery—Pharmacology. 
Mutation—identify mutations and rank for potential oncogenicity 
Our discovery process begins by identifying oncogenic mutations. We use population-level cancer genetic data obtained from all tumor types, to identify potential families of mutations that occur within individual oncogenes. 
We have developed unique insights into the specific structural features of a protein that are associated with oncogenic mutations. The algorithm underlying our MAP drug discovery engine scores each mutation for its potential oncogenicity, which we refer to as a MAP score. We use our algorithm as a machine-learning tool to predict the oncogenicity of various uncharacterized mutations, isolating oncogenic driver mutations from the silent and passenger mutations. We map these mutations onto the 3-dimensional structure of a protein to determine which of the many mutations expressed by human tumors occur at sites associated with oncogenicity. 
For HER2 and EGFR, we observed that oncogenic mutations are distributed nearly uniformly throughout the sequence of these two genes, revealing many mutations occurring outside of the ATP site, which have not been targeted by drugs. 
For example, applying our algorithm to all currently known mutations in HER2 alone reveals a subset of mutations with high MAP scores, which we believe is a predictor of oncogenicity. For the ErbB family, we observed 3,868 unique mis-sense mutations (935 mutations in EGFR, 670 mutations in HER2, 794 mutations in HER3 and 1,469 mutations in HER4). These mutations are distributed throughout the target sequence. As illustrated in the figure below, we observed 670 unique mutations expressed in HER2, detected within a combined human tumor data set of approximately 70,000 cases (GENIE 5.0 and TCGA data sets). Through this analysis, we re-identified or confirmed the known HER2 oncogenic mutations, which are the mutations that we targeted with our earlier generation product candidate. We also identified an additional subset of mutations with high MAP scores, and we are currently validating these putative oncogenic mutations experimentally. Our goal is to expand our targeted mutation family to potentially include this additional group of non-canonical mutations. 
Our genetic sequencing analysis has identified a family of 48 non-canonical mutations in both the extracellular and kinase domains of EGFR and HER2. The figure below is a compilation of the non-canonical EGFR and HER2 oncogenic mutations that we are targeting in both of our ErbB programs. Each dot represents a unique non-canonical EGFR and HER2 oncogenic mutation found in individual tumors, while the height of each dot represents the frequency at which such mutation was found. The sites of two mutations defined as canonical mutations are indicated. The frequency for EGFR oncogenic mutations expressed in GBM was calculated as relative frequency within GBM. The frequency for all other EGFR and HER2 mutations was calculated relative to all solid tumors (approximately 70,000 tumors within project GENIE 5.0 / TCGA dataset). Specifically, the figure shows the prevalence of various types of alterations of EGFR expressed in GBM (EGFRvIII, EGFRvII, EGFRvVI, three mutations affecting EGFR-A289 and two mutations affecting EGFR-G598) and various types of EGFR and HER2 alterations expressed across solid tumors (two mutations affecting HER2-S310, HER2-R678Q, six unique mutations affecting HER2-L755, four unique mutations affecting HER2-V777, HER2-V842I, 46 unique mutations that are deletions within exon 19, and 28 unique mutations that are insertions within exon 20 and EGFR-L858R). 
We selected 43 additional HER2 mutations to experimentally test for oncogenicity using the BaF3 transformation assay. Thirty-three of the 43 mutations tested had high MAP scores and were therefore predicted to have oncogenic behavior, while ten of the 43 mutations had low MAP scores and were therefore not predicted to be oncogenic. In this screen, we also tested HER2 WT and three HER2 mutations that we had already observed to have oncogenic behavior. HER2 WT was unable to transform BaF3 cells to IL-3 independent proliferation, while all three validated HER2 oncogenic mutations (HER2-V842I, L755S and S310F) successfully transformed cells, as evidenced by greater than three-fold proliferation over a seven-day period. Of the 33 mutations with high MAP scores that were predicted to be oncogenic, 15 were transformative. In contrast, among the group of mutations with low MAP scores that were not predicted to have oncogenic behavior, only two transformed BaF3 cells to proliferate greater than three-fold over seven days. We found newly characterized mutations to be sensitive to an earlier clinical candidate, as evidenced below with potent inhibition of proliferation against cells transformed by the HER2-R103Q mutation. 
Allostery—understanding the mechanism for oncogenic activation 
We evaluate the oncogenicity of these mutations occurring outside of the ATP site and use our preclinical models to reveal how they drive protein conformation change to promote oncogenicity. We then use these models to determine whether the drug sensitivity profile, or pharmacology, of the ATP site is altered. We use this information to group into oncogene families that share a similar ATP site pharmacology.
In the ErbB space, the drug selectivity patterns of mutant EGFR and HER2 kinases provide evidence of unique conformational states driven by mutation. As illustrated in the figure below, dimerization is required for receptor activation, an important step in oncogenic signaling. In EGFR WT, the binding of a ligand to the extracellular domain promotes an active dimer conformation. In the case of EGFR WT, this is a transient ligand-induced dimer conformation. We have discovered that a family of EGFR and HER2 mutations activate these kinases and promote oncogenicity by stabilizing the kinase in a unique constitutive dimer conformation. Importantly, the constitutive dimer conformation results in a change in selectivity for drugs which bind to the ATP site, potentially reducing the effectiveness of currently approved targeted therapies, such as erlotinib.
The protein conformation for the active form of mutant ErbB receptors is unique from the conformation of EGFR WT. EGFR WT is inactive in its monomeric form and activated upon the binding of an EGF ligand (shown in dark purple) to the extracellular domain, forming an active transient ligand-induced dimer conformation. Oncogenic ErbB mutations (highlighted in magenta in this example) can promote a constitutive dimer conformation which has high activity and is oncogenic.
Pharmacology—developing mutation spectrum-selective (MasterKey Inhibitors) drugs to our targets 
We apply molecular dynamics to simulate the conformational state for any given mutation, and in this manner deliver design ready conformations for drug discovery. Our team of experienced medicinal and computational chemists seeks to leverage these conformations to design and identify small molecules that bind to the active site and inhibit the target only when it is in the unique conformation promoted by the non-canonical oncogenic mutations we identified. Combining a multidimensional medicinal chemistry lead identification and optimization strategy with our proprietary know-how in drug design, we aim to identify small molecules with bespoke selectivity against the entire desired spectrum of mutations as a family, while at the same time sparing inhibition of the wild type form of the protein or other unwanted targets. For the development of BDTX-1535, our product candidate that is currently in clinical development, we utilized these cell and tumor models as biological screens that recapitulate the tumor biology for these mutations. BDTX-1535 binds to the ATP-site to inhibit the constitutive dimer in a family of EGFR mutations, while at the same time sparing inhibition of the normal EGFR WT. In preclinical models, we have validated the activity for BDTX-1535 against the most commonly occurring of these types of mutations (EGFR vIII, EGFR amplification, EGFR Exon 19 deletion EGFR-746-750, EGFR-L858R, EGFR-C797S, EGFR-L861R and EGFR-G719X).
Our product candidates and development programs 
We are leveraging our MAP drug discovery engine to develop a drug pipeline of orally available, potent and selective small molecule MasterKey therapies that target genetic drivers in several cancers. We own worldwide commercial rights to all of our product candidates.
BDTX-1535: a brain penetrant, mutant selective, irreversible EGFR MasterKey inhibitor targeting EGFR mutations expressed in GBM and EGFR driver and resistance mutations in NSCLC 
Background and limitations of current EGFR inhibitors 
EGFR is a potent oncogene commonly altered in many cancers, including GBM and NSCLC. EGFR alterations and EGFR mutations in GBM occur primarily in the extracellular domain, while NSCLC mutations more commonly impact the kinase domain. 
Almost 50 percent of GBM tumors express one or more EGFR alterations that affect the extracellular region of the receptor kinase and promote oncogenic activation. These include large deletions in the extracellular domain, including the mutants EGFRvIII, EGFRvVI, and EGFRvII. These also include any one of a number of short variants, single amino acid substitutions affecting the extracellular domain, the most common of which are substitutions at position A289. These mutants are constitutively active, exhibit sustained signaling that is resistant to downregulation, and are both transforming and tumorigenic. Their expression has been associated with poor long-term overall survival. 
EGFR oncogenic mutations are expressed throughout the target sequence. The figure below shows the most frequent EGFR oncogenic mutations expressed in GBM (EGFRvIII, EGFRvII, EGFRvVI, EGFR-G598 mutations, EGFR-A289 mutations), which was calculated as relative frequency within GBM (Brennan et al Cell 2013). Each dot represents a unique oncogenic mutation found in individual tumors and the height of each dot represents the frequency with which it was found. A given GBM patient may co-express multiple different EGFR oncogenic mutations. Therefore, we believe a critical challenge to overcome in drug discovery and clinical development of targeted therapies is to develop precision medicines for GBM that efficiently block the oncogenic activity across all of these various EGFR species. 
We have shown that the mechanism of activation for these EGFR mutants requires formation of a covalent dimer, which is always active, also known as a constitutive dimer. The formatting of these constitutive dimers is essential for oncogenicity. No current generation EGFR-directed therapy has proved effective in treating patients that express these mutations. We believe that current targeted therapies have been unsuccessful in treating GBM due to (i) the concurrent expression of these EGFR oncogenic alterations within individual patients, (ii) insufficient drug potency for EGFR oncogenic alterations, (iii) reversible binding mode leading to paradoxical activation and iv) low levels of brain penetration. The figure below illustrates distinct EGFR oncogenic mutations (EGFRvIII, EGFRvII, EGFRvI, EGFR-A289V) that share the ability to promote constitutively active, ligand independent dimer conformation, which is different from the transient ligand-induced dimer conformation for EGFR WT. For mutants, the region surrounding each mutation site is highlighted in magenta. For EGFR WT, bound EGF ligand is shown in dark purple.
Currently approved reversible EGFR inhibitors, those proven clinically efficacious in NSCLC, have not demonstrated clinical activity in GBM. We believe this is, in part, due to reversible inhibitors, such as erlotinib, causing paradoxical activation of EGFR alterations. As shown in the figure below, erlotinib demonstrates antiproliferative activity in models harboring an exon 19 deletion mutation common in NSCLC. However, in a GBM model expressing EGFRvIII, erlotinib results in paradoxical activation which increases tumor proliferation at sub-saturating dose levels. We believe the irreversible binding profile of BDTX-1535 offers an opportunity to avoid paradoxical activation and potently inhibit the locked dimers formed by EGFR alterations commonly seen in GBM. 
Reversible EGFR Inhibitors Show Potentially Detrimental Pharmacology in EGFR Driven GBM
In NSCLC, EGFR inhibitors have demonstrated significant clinical benefit in patients with primary EGFR activating mutations and are the current first-line standard of care. However, over time, almost all patients acquire resistance and relapse. For the third generation EGFR inhibitor osimertinib, acquired resistance can be associated with the acquisition of the EGFR-C797S mutation against which osimertinib is inactive. Additionally, a subset of NSCLC patients at primary diagnosis harbor intrinsic resistance EGFR mutations including complex mutations that are poorly addressed with current therapies. Furthermore, up to half of all NSCLC patients either have central nervous system (CNS) metastases at diagnosis or will develop them while on treatment. The majority of first- and second-generation EGFR inhibitors do not adequately penetrate the CNS, and while third generation, brain penetrant EGFR inhibitors such as osimertinib may delay the progression of CNS metastases, there are few options remaining to patients when resistance inevitably arises. Thus, treatment for patients who have progressed on current EGFR targeted agents with acquired mutations that drive resistance, including for patients with brain metastases, remains an area of high unmet medical need in NSCLC.
Our solution: BDTX-1535 
In November 2020, we announced the nomination of BDTX-1535 as a development candidate for the treatment of GBM and NSCLC with or without brain metastases. BDTX-1535 is a potent, selective, irreversible, oral and brain penetrant small molecule inhibitor designed to address the critical unmet need in GBM and NSCLC driven by EGFR alterations. The pharmacological activity of BDTX-1535 was optimized to inhibit a wide spectrum of EGFR mutations that drive acquired and intrinsic resistance mechanisms, as well as targeting the CNS tumor settings through its potential for high brain exposure. 
In cell-based assays, BDTX-1535 achieved potent MasterKey inhibition of a family of oncogenic EGFR variants expressed in GBM and EGFR amplification with selectivity versus normally expressed EGFR WT. This includes classical, intrinsic resistance and acquired resistance mutations expressed in NSCLC. BDTX-1535 is not a potent inhibitor of Exon20 insertion driver mutations or the T790M resistance mutation.

Additionally, BDTX-1535 achieved complete and sustained inhibition (>24 hours) of the phosphorylated state of EGFR in a mouse model expressing the common glioblastoma mutation, EGFRvIII, consistent with its irreversible binding mechanism demonstrated in vitro to EGFR WT. Furthermore, BDTX-1535 demonstrated tumor growth inhibition in a mouse model bearing intracranial GBM6 PDX expressing EGFRvIII and EGFR amplification, supporting its ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. BDTX-1535 also achieved sustained inhibition (>24 hours) of the phosphorylated state of EGFR in cells harboring the NSCLC acquired resistance mutation, C797S, as well as tumor growth inhibition in a mouse model bearing PDX tumors expressing C797S. This indicated that BDTX-1535 retains its ability to irreversibly bind to the serine 797 mutant residue that can be acquired after treatment with third generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors used in the first line setting.

Right: Inhibition of the phosphorylated state of EGFR in cells harboring the NSCLC Exon19 deletion and the acquired resistance mutation, C797S, after washout.
Furthermore, in mouse models, BDTX-1535 achieved tumor growth inhibition and regression in multiple subcutaneous mouse models bearing PDX and allograft tumors representing a spectrum of EGFR alterations. These models were selected to cover the EGFR alterations commonly found in patients with GBM as well as classical, intrinsic resistance, and acquired resistance mutations found in NSCLC patients.

Clinical development
The IND for BDTX-1535 was cleared by the FDA in the first quarter of 2022, and the first-in-human clinical trial (BDTX1535-101) was also initiated in the first quarter of 2022. The Phase 1 dose escalation part of this trial is actively enrolling patients harboring EGFR oncogenic alterations both in GBM and NSCLC, with or without brain metastases. 
BDTX1535-101 is an open-label, multicenter Phase 1 trial consisting of a dose escalation portion and disease specific dose expansion cohorts. It is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary antitumor activity of BDTX-1535 in patients with either recurrent GBM expressing EGFR alterations or advanced/metastatic NSCLC harboring sensitizing EGFR mutations, with or without brain metastases, who have progressed on an approved EGFR inhibitor. Eligible NSCLC patients must have either an intrinsic resistance EGFR mutation in exon 18 or 21 or an acquired C797S mutation following prior therapy with a 3rd-generation EGFR inhibitor. As opposed to a traditional “3+3” design, the dose escalation part is based on a Bayesian adaptive design which allows a various number of patients to be enrolled at each dose level to assess safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of BDTX-1535 in order to establish a maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Once an MTD has been established, BDTX-1535 monotherapy will be explored in disease specific dose expansion cohorts to further evaluate safety, PK, and preliminary efficacy in order to establish a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). The trial allows evaluation of two dose levels in a disease specific expansion cohort in order to further optimize the RP2D dose selection for an indication. The disease specific dose expansion cohorts include: patients with recurrent GBM with EGFR alterations, patients with locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC with an acquired resistance EGFR mutation (e.g., C797S) with and without brain metastases, and patients with locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC with oncogenic EGFR intrinsic resistance mutations (e.g., G719X), in each case with and without brain metastases. The trial also includes a cohort of newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients to explore safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity of BDTX-1535 in combination with temozolomide.
Our regulatory strategy includes pursuing a registration path for patients with recurrent GBM in parallel with NSCLC patients with either intrinsic resistance mutations or acquired resistance mutations who have progressed or are resistant to a third generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). We expect to provide an update on the clinical data obtained from the BDTX1535-101 Phase 1 clinical trial in the second half of 2023.
BDTX-4933: a highly selective, brain penetrant RAF MasterKey inhibitor targeting oncogenic BRAF Class I, II, III and activated RAF dimers in the setting of RAS mutations
Background and limitations of RAF inhibitors
BRAF mutations are among the most common mutation found in tumors. Oncogenic alterations affecting BRAF include the V600E mutation (Class I) active site mutation together with families of non-canonical BRAF mutations (Class II and Class III) that are active as dimers. While the V600E Class I mutation has been successfully targeted in melanoma and other solid tumors, there are currently no approved therapies that target the full spectrum of Class II and Class III mutations that are expressed in melanoma and a range of other solid tumors. Additionally, expression of all classes of BRAF mutations commonly occurs in patients with CNS tumors or with brain metastasis, which currently remain unaddressed by approved drugs due to their poor brain penetration. Approved BRAF inhibitors can lead to unwanted paradoxical activation, which may lead to poor efficacy and secondary malignancies.
Classification of BRAF mutations. Class I, V600, signals as a monomer in an RAS-independent manner and constitutively activates the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Class II and III BRAF mutations signal as dimers in an RAS-independent, and -dependent, respectively, and currently there are no approved therapies for these BRAF dimer mutations. First generation BRAF V600E-selective inhibitors are inactive against BRAF dimers, Class II and Class III.
Our solution: BDTX-4933 
BDTX-4933 is designed as a brain penetrant, small molecule MasterKey reversible oral inhibitor of oncogenic BRAF Class I, II and III active RAF dimers promoted by upstream oncogenic alterations expressed by human cancers, while avoiding paradoxical activation. We believe that BDTX-4933 could offer an improved approach for treating melanoma, NSCLC and other solid tumors expressing Class I mutations with brain metastases as well as cancers expressing Class I, II and III alterations, including CNS diseases such as gliomas.
In cell-based assays, BDTX-4933 demonstrated potent inhibition of a wide spectrum of BRAF alterations including fusions and exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation. In preclinical BRAF-driven tumor models expressing Class I, II and III mutations, daily dosing of BDTX-4933 demonstrated dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition, tumor regression and survival advantage consistent with potent on-target and on-pathway inhibition. BDTX-4933 also demonstrated robust brain penetration properties and activity in intracranial mouse tumor models expressing the Class I V600E mutation.
MasterKey property of BDTX-4933 inhibitor: BDTX-4933 inhibitor demonstrates robust anti-tumor activity and regression across preclinical tumor models representing all 3 classes of BRAF mutations. 
Survival rate of tumor bearing mice. BDTX-4933 inhibitor treated animals show significant extended survival compared to vehicle. 
Clinical development
The IND for BDTX-4933 was cleared by the FDA in the first quarter of 2023. We expect to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial for BDTX-4933 in select indications for patients harboring all-class BRAF or RAS mutations in the first half of 2023.
BDTX-189: an inhibitor of oncogenic mutations of EGFR and HER2 
BDTX-189 was designed as an orally available small molecule MasterKey inhibitor to target a family of non-canonical and canonical driver mutations of EGFR and HER2, including Exon20 insertion, while sparing EGFR WT while also being a potent inhibitor of HER2 wild type (HER2 WT). These mutations are present in solid tumors including NSCLC, breast, gastric, colon, and endometrial cancers. To focus on progressing our pipeline through important upcoming milestones for BDTX-1535 and BDTX-4933 as well as our discovery efforts, in April 2022, we announced the discontinuation of the development of BDTX-189. 
Early-stage programs 
We are applying our MAP drug discovery engine to the analysis of the mutation landscape of more than 300 genes, including 92 kinases within Foundation Medicine’s FoundationOne CDx test panel. We are advancing several early programs focused on targeting a range of driver mutations, including activating mutations. As part of our ongoing efforts to leverage our know-how regarding mutations in the ErbB family, we continue to investigate novel potent and selective compounds directed against this family of targets.
FGFR program
Oncogenic mutations affecting FGFR2 and FGFR3 (including short variant point mutations and fusions) are expressed across a range of cancers such as bladder and cholangiocarcinoma. While these mutations have been targeted by three first generation pan-FGFR inhibitors (erdafitinib, pemigatinib and infigratinib), clinical success has been hindered by dose limiting toxicities related to on-target inhibition of FGFR1, which causes hyperphosphatemia and the need for significant dose interruptions and dose reductions, and even discontinuation. These limitations curtail the efficacy of current generation FGFR targeted therapies.
BDTX FGFR program compounds are MasterKey inhibitors of oncogenic FGFR2/3 mutations with selectivity versus FGFR1 and activity against gatekeeper mutations. Tumor regression in mouse models has been observed. We anticipate progressing towards selection of a development candidate for the BDTX FGFR program in 2023.
Undisclosed program
We expect one other undisclosed program in solid tumors to progress to development candidate nomination in 2023. 
Competition 
Our industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face substantial competition from major pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources. Smaller and early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. As a result, our competitors may discover, develop, license or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do. 
We face competition with respect to our current product candidates and will face competition with respect to future product candidates, from segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that pursue targeted therapies for patients with genetically defined cancers. 
There are currently compounds approved and in development which target the EGFR pathway and against which we expect BDTX-1535 to compete: 
•In patients with EGFR acquired resistance: combination of amivantamab, or Rybrevant, and lazertinib, the former of which is marketed by and the latter of which is being developed by Janssen Biotech, Inc.; patritumab deruxtecan, which is being developed by Daiichi Sankyo Co.; BLU-525 and BLU-945, which are under development by BluePrint Medicines Corporation; and BBT-176, which is being developed by Bridge Biotherapeutics, Inc., and THE-349 under development by Theseus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
•In patients with EGFR intrinsic resistance: afatinib, or GILOTRIF, which is marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim and approved as first-line treatment of NSCLC patients with exon 18 mutations; osimertinib, or TAGRISSO, which is marketed by AstraZeneca plc and is being prescribed off-label for NSCLC patients with exon 18 mutations; and neratinib, which is marketed by Puma Biotechnology, Inc. 
•In patients with EGFR alterations present in GBM: ERAS-801, which is under development by Erasca, Inc.; WSD-0922-FU, which is under development by Wayshine Biopharm International Ltd.; CM93, which is under development by Crimson Biopharm Inc.; RO7428731, which is under development by Hoffman Roche; TAS-2940, which is under development by Taiho Oncology, Inc.; and epitinib, which is under development by Hutchison MediPharma Ltd. 
There are currently compounds in development which target the RAS-RAF pathway and against which we expect BDTX-4933 to compete: 
•In patients with BRAF Class II/III mutations and other RAS mutations: Day One Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., Kinnate Biopharma Inc., Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc, F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG, Erasca, Inc., Mirati Therapeutics, Inc., Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Verastem, Inc., Revolution Medicines, Inc., Fore Biotherapeutics Inc., Nested Therapeutics Inc., and C4 Therapeutics, Inc.
In addition, there are other small molecule and precision oncology-focused companies with whom we may eventually compete, including Loxo Oncology, Inc. (acquired by Eli Lilly and Company), SpringWorks Therapeutics, Inc., Centessa Pharmaceuticals plc, Voronoi Inc., Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Relay Therapeutics, Inc.
Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we may or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used and less costly or have a better safety profile than our products and these competitors may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products. 
In addition, we will likely need to develop our product candidates in collaboration with diagnostic companies, and we will face competition from other companies in establishing these collaborations. Our competitors will also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
Furthermore, we also face competition more broadly across the market for cost-effective and reimbursable cancer treatments. The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted drug therapy or a combination of such methods. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While our product candidates, if any are approved, may compete with these existing drug and other therapies, to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our product candidates may not be competitive with them. Some of these drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products or specific branded products. We expect that if our product candidates are approved, they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic, including branded generic, products. As a result, obtaining market acceptance of, and a gaining significant share of the market for, any of our product candidates that we successfully introduce to the market will pose challenges. In addition, many companies are developing new therapeutics, and we cannot predict what the standard of care will be as our product candidates progress through clinical development. 
The acquisition or licensing of pharmaceutical products is also very competitive. If we seek to acquire or license products, we will face substantial competition from a number of more established companies, some of which have acknowledged strategies to license or acquire products and many of which are bigger than us and have more institutional experience and greater cash flows than we have. These more established companies may have competitive advantages over us, as may other emerging companies taking similar or different approaches to product licenses and/or acquisitions. In addition, a number of established research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may acquire products in late stages of development to augment their internal product lines, which may provide those companies with an even greater competitive advantage.
Manufacturing and Supply
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates undergoing preclinical testing, as well as for clinical testing and commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. 
All of our product candidates are small molecules and are manufactured via synthetic processes from available starting materials. The chemistry appears amenable to scale up and does not currently require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs. 
We generally expect to rely on one or more potential partners for the manufacture of companion diagnostics for our products, which are assays or tests to identify an appropriate patient population.
Commercialization 
Subject to receiving marketing approvals, we expect to commence commercialization activities by building a focused sales and marketing organization in the United States to sell our products. We believe that such an organization will be able to address the community of oncologists who are the key specialists in treating the patient populations for which our product candidates are being developed. Outside the United States, we may enter into distribution and other marketing arrangements with third parties for any of our product candidates that obtain marketing approval. 
We also plan to build a marketing and sales management organization to create and implement marketing strategies for any products that we market through our own sales organization and to oversee and support our sales force. The responsibilities of the marketing organization would include developing educational initiatives with respect to approved products and establishing relationships with researchers and practitioners in relevant fields of medicine.
Intellectual property 
We seek to protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology that we consider important to our business, including by pursuing patent applications that cover our product candidates and methods of using the same, as well as any other relevant inventions and improvements that are considered commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position. Our commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain, maintain, enforce and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights for the technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business, and to defend any patents we may own or in-license in the future, prevent others from infringing any patents we may own or in-license in the future, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. 
As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our product candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, our pending patent applications, and any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties, may not result in the issuance of patents and any issued patents we may obtain do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in any patents we may own or in-license in the future. Any issued patents that we own, or may own or in-license in the future may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or have the scope of their claims narrowed. For example, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending third-party patent applications. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology or therapeutics to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us, which is highly unpredictable. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby limiting the protection such patent would afford the respective product and any competitive advantage such patent may provide. 
The term of individual patents depends upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent claiming a new drug product may also be eligible for a limited patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. The restoration period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of a clinical investigation involving human beings is begun and the submission date of an application, plus the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and only those claims covering the approved product, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Additionally, the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The United States Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA. In the future, if our product candidates receive approval by the FDA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on any issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical studies for each product and other factors. There can be no assurance that our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustments to the terms of any patents we may own or in-license in the future. In addition, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. Patent term may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our products for an adequate amount of time. 
As of February 23, 2023, we own seven U.S. provisional patent applications, four pending U.S. patent applications, and one issued U.S. patent. We also own ten Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, patent applications and 28 foreign patent applications. Any U.S. or foreign patent issuing from these patent applications would be scheduled to expire in 2039 to 2043, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustment or patent term extension, and assuming that conversions are timely made based upon U.S. provisional patent applications, that national phase entries are timely made based upon the pending PCT applications, and the payment of all applicable maintenance or annuity fees.
BDTX-1535
As of February 23, 2023, we own one U.S. patent application, and two PCT patent application, and 15 foreign patent applications that cover our non-small cell lung cancer and glioblastoma program, including the composition of matter for BDTX-1535, polymorphs of BDTX-1535, as well as methods of using and making BDTX-1535. Any U.S. or foreign patent issued from these pending applications would be scheduled to expire between 2040 and 2042, assuming that national phase entries are timely made based upon the pending PCT applications, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustment or patent term extension. 
BDTX-4933
As of February 23, 2023, we own three U.S. provisional patent applications, one PCT patent application, and one foreign patent application that cover our BRAF program, including the composition of matter for BDTX-4933 as well as methods of using and making BDTX-4933. Any U.S. or foreign patent issued from these pending applications would be scheduled to expire between 2042 and 2043, assuming that conversions are timely made based upon U.S. provisional patent applications, that national phase entries are timely made based upon the pending PCT applications, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustment or patent term extension.
BDTX-189
As of February 23, 2023, we own one pending U.S. patent application, one U.S. patent and 12 foreign patent applications that cover our tumor agnostic program, including the composition of matter for BDTX-189, polymorphs of BDTX-189, as well as methods of using and making BDTX-189. Any U.S. or foreign patent issued from these pending applications would be scheduled to expire in 2039, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustment or patent term extension, assuming national phase entries are timely made based upon the pending PCT application and payment of all applicable maintenance or annuity fees.
FGFR program
As of February 23, 2023, we own one PCT patent application that covers our FGFR program, which is directed to the composition of matter for the compounds of the program, analogs thereof, as well as methods of using and making these compounds. Any U.S. or foreign patent issued from this pending application would be scheduled to expire in 2042, assuming that conversions are timely made based upon U.S. provisional patent applications, that national phase entries are timely made based upon the pending PCT applications, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustment or patent term extension.
MAP drug discovery engine 
As of February 23, 2023, we own one U.S. patent application that covers our MAP drug discovery engine and the use thereof in developing and applying therapeutics. Any U.S. patent issued from this U.S. patent application would be scheduled to expire in 2040, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustment or patent term extension. 
Prosecution is a lengthy process, during which the scope of the claims initially submitted for examination by the USPTO are often significantly narrowed by the time they issue, if they issue at all. Any of our pending PCT patent applications are not eligible to become issued patents until, among other things, we file national stage patent applications within 30 months in the countries in which we seek patent protection. If we do not timely file any national stage patent applications, we may lose our priority date with respect to our PCT patent applications and any patent protection on the inventions disclosed in such PCT patent applications. Our provisional patent applications may never result in issued patents and are not eligible to become issued patents until, among other things, we file a non-provisional patent application within 12 months of filing the related provisional patent application. If we do not timely file non-provisional patent applications, we may lose our priority date with respect to our provisional patent applications and any patent protection on the inventions disclosed in our provisional patent applications. While we intend to timely file non-provisional and national stage patent applications relating to our provisional and PCT patent applications, we cannot predict whether any of our future patent applications for BDTX-1535, BDTX-4933 or any of our other product candidates or technology will result in the issuance of patents that effectively protect BDTX-1535, BDTX-4933 or our other product candidates or technology. If we do not successfully obtain patent protection, or, even if we do obtain patent protection, if the scope of the patent protection we or our potential licensors obtain with respect to BDTX-1535, BDTX-4933 or our other product candidates or technology is not sufficiently broad, we will be unable to prevent others from using our technology or from developing or commercializing technology and products similar or identical to ours or other competing products and technologies. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Intellectual Property.” 
In addition to patent applications, we rely on unpatented trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets and confidential know-how are difficult to protect. In particular, we anticipate that with respect to the building of our compound library, our trade secrets and know-how will over time be disseminated within the industry through independent development and public presentations describing the methodology. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by executing confidentiality agreements with our collaborators and scientific advisors and non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. We have also executed agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected consultants, scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements we enter into are designed to protect our proprietary information and the agreements or clauses requiring assignment of inventions to us are designed to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through our relationship with the respective counterparty. We cannot guarantee that we will have executed such agreements with all applicable employees and contractors, or that these agreements will afford us adequate protection of our intellectual property and proprietary information rights. In addition, our trade secrets and/or confidential know-how may become known or be independently developed by a third party, or misused by any collaborator to whom we disclose such information. These agreements may also be breached, and we may not have an adequate remedy for any such breach. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information, third parties may independently develop the same or similar proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our proprietary information. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Intellectual Property.” 
Government regulation
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of drugs. We, along with our vendors, contract research organizations and contract manufacturers, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
In the United States, where we are initially focusing our drug development, the FDA regulates drug products under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), its implementing regulations and other laws. Our product candidates are early-stage and none of our product candidates has been approved by the FDA for marketing in the United States. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time with respect to product development, clinical testing, approval or any other legal requirements relating to product manufacture, processing, handling, storage, quality control, safety, marketing, advertising, promotion, packaging, labeling, export, import, distribution, or sale, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions or other legal consequences. These sanctions or consequences could include, among other things, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, issuance of clinical holds for ongoing studies, suspension or revocation of approved applications, warning or untitled letters, product withdrawals or recalls, product seizures, relabeling or repackaging, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution brought by the FDA and the U.S. Department of Justice or other governmental entities. 
The process required by the FDA before our product candidates are approved as drugs for therapeutic indications and may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
•completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with GLP requirements; 
•submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
•approval by an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
•submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA;
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA, to accept the filing for review;
•satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
•potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA;
•payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA; and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
Preclinical and clinical trials for drugs 
Before testing any drug in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess safety and in some cases to establish the rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal and state regulations and requirements, including GLP requirements for safety/toxicology studies. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before clinical trials may begin. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may result in the FDA not allowing clinical trials to commence or not allowing clinical trials to commence on the terms originally specified in the IND. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development of a product candidate, and the FDA must grant permission, either explicitly or implicitly by not objecting, before each clinical trial can begin. 
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable related to the anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trials to public registries. Information about clinical trials, including clinical trials results, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website. 
While we plan to conduct any international clinical trials under our INDs we obtain with the FDA in the future, a sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary. 
Clinical trials to evaluate therapeutic indications to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap. 
•Phase 1—Phase 1 clinical trials involve initial introduction of the investigational product into healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, excretion the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.
•Phase 2—Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. 
•Phase 3—Phase 3 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and physician labeling. 
In March 2022, the FDA released a final guidance entitled “Expansion Cohorts: Use in First-In-Human Clinical Trials to Expedite Development of Oncology Drugs and Biologics,” which outlines how drug developers can utilize an adaptive trial design commonly referred to as a seamless trial design in early stages of oncology drug development (i.e., the first-in-human clinical trial) to compress the traditional three phases of trials into one continuous trial called an expansion cohort trial. Information to support the design of individual expansion cohorts are included in IND applications and assessed by FDA. Expansion cohort trials can potentially bring efficiency to drug development and reduce developmental costs and time. 
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA. 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators fifteen days after the trial sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human volunteers and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must also notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
U.S. marketing approval for drugs 
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. An NDA is a request for approval to market a new drug for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of the drug’s safety and efficacy. The marketing application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be marketed in the United States. 
The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the NDA. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. Under the goals and polices agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA targets ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular entity NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular entity NDA for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard or priority NDAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. 
 Further, under PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
The FDA also may require submission of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk-minimization tools. 
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the Sponsor product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and other requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA. 
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 
Even if the FDA approves a product, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
Orphan drug designation and exclusivity 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, though companies developing orphan products are eligible for certain incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing and waiver of application fees. 
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same therapeutic agent for the same indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a subsequent product’s showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the original applicant cannot produce sufficient quantities of product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different therapeutic agents for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same therapeutic agent for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for the same therapeutic agent for the same indication before we do, unless we are able to demonstrate that our product is clinically superior. If an orphan designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity. Further, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
Rare pediatric disease designation and priority review vouchers 
Under the FD&C Act, the FDA incentivizes the development of drugs that meet the definition of a “rare pediatric disease,” defined to mean a serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious of life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years and the disease affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or affects more than 200,000 in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making in the United States a drug for such disease or condition will be received from sales in the United States of such drug. The sponsor of a product candidate for a rare pediatric disease may be eligible for a voucher that can be used to obtain a priority review for a subsequent human drug application after the date of approval of the rare pediatric disease drug product, referred to as a priority review voucher, or PRV. A sponsor may request rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA prior to the submission of its NDA. A rare pediatric disease designation does not guarantee that a sponsor will receive a PRV upon approval of its NDA. Moreover, a sponsor who chooses not to submit a rare pediatric disease designation request may nonetheless receive a PRV upon approval of their marketing application if they request such a voucher in their original marketing application and meet all of the eligibility criteria. If a PRV is received, it may be sold or transferred an unlimited number of times. Congress has extended the PRV program through September 30, 2024, with potential for PRVs to be granted through September 30, 2026. 
Expedited development and review programs for drugs 
The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval, and the purpose of these programs is to either expedite the development or review of important new drugs to get them to patients earlier than under standard FDA development and review procedures. 
A new drug is eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast Track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor interactions with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed, meaning that the agency may review portions of the marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application, as well as Priority Review, discussed below. In addition, a new drug may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program beginning as early as Phase 1, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate. 
Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for additional FDA programs intended to expedite the review and approval process, including Priority Review designation and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for Priority Review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. Under priority review, the FDA must review an application in six months compared to ten months for a standard review. Additionally, products are eligible for accelerated approval if they can be shown to have an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. 
Accelerated approval is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. Under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 (FDORA), the FDA may require, as appropriate, that such trials be underway prior to approval or within a specific time period after the date of approval for a product granted accelerated approval. Under FDORA, the FDA has increased authority for expedited procedures to withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. In addition, for products being considered for accelerated approval, the FDA generally requires, unless otherwise informed by the FDA, that all advertising and promotional materials that are intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days following marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period. Additionally, after 120 days following marketing approval, all advertising and promotional materials must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination or publication. 
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval do not change the scientific or medical standards for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval but may expedite the development or review process. 
Pediatric information and pediatric exclusivity 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, certain NDAs and certain supplements to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, amended the FD&C Act to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs. 
A drug can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study. 
U.S. post-approval requirements for drugs 
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including investigation by federal and state authorities. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials. 
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-market testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. 
In addition, drug manufacturers and their subcontractors involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our contract manufacturers. Manufacturers and other parties involved in the drug supply chain for prescription drug products must also comply with product tracking and tracing requirements and for notifying the FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products or products that are otherwise unfit for distribution in the United States. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. There is also a continuing, annual prescription drug product program user fee. 
Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
•refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and
•consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; or mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and issuance of corrective information. 
Regulation of companion diagnostics 
We believe that the success of certain of our product candidates may depend, in part, on the development and commercialization of a companion diagnostic. Companion diagnostics identify patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular therapeutic product; identify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious side effects as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic product; or monitor response to treatment with a particular therapeutic product for the purpose of adjusting treatment to achieve improved safety or effectiveness. Companion diagnostics are regulated as medical devices by the FDA. In the United States, the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption or FDA exercise of enforcement discretion applies, diagnostic tests generally require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercialization. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are clearance of a premarket notification, or 510(k), application, and approval of a premarket approval, or PMA, application. 
To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, or for certain modifications to devices that have received 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or to a preamendment device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, or a predicate device, for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a PMA. In making a determination that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the FDA compares the proposed device to the predicate device or predicate devices and assesses whether the subject device is comparable to the predicate device or predicate devices with respect to intended use, technology, design and other features which could affect safety and effectiveness. If the FDA determines that the subject device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device or predicate devices, the subject device may be cleared for marketing. The 510(k) premarket notification pathway generally takes from three to twelve months from the date the application is completed, but can take significantly longer. 
PMA applications must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA application typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. The FDA’s review of an initial PMA application is required by statute to take between six to ten months, although the process typically takes longer, and may require several years to complete. If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny the approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post-approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 
On July 31, 2014, the FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for “In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.” According to the guidance document, for novel therapeutic products that depend on the use of a diagnostic test and where the diagnostic device could be essential for the safe and effective use of the corresponding therapeutic product, the premarket application for the companion diagnostic device should be developed and approved or cleared contemporaneously with the therapeutic, although the FDA recognizes that there may be cases when contemporaneous development may not be possible. However, in cases where a drug cannot be used safely or effectively without the companion diagnostic, the FDA’s guidance indicates it will generally not approve the drug without the approval or clearance of the diagnostic device. The FDA also issued a draft guidance in July 2016 setting forth the principles for co-development of an in vitro companion diagnostic device with a therapeutic product. The draft guidance describes principles to guide the development and contemporaneous marketing authorization for the therapeutic product and its corresponding in vitro companion diagnostic. 
Once cleared or approved, the companion diagnostic device must adhere to post-marketing requirements including the requirements of the FDA’s quality system regulation, adverse event reporting, recalls and corrections along with product marketing requirements and limitations. Like drug makers, companion diagnostic makers are subject to unannounced FDA inspections at any time during which the FDA will conduct an audit of the product(s) and the company’s facilities for compliance with its authorities. 
Other regulatory matters 
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities of product candidates following product approval, where applicable, or commercialization are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, which may include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments and governmental agencies. 
Other healthcare and privacy laws 
Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our business operations and any current or future arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we develop, market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In the United States, these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below. 
•The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order, arrangement or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS) or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. Violations are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, imprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (FCA) or federal civil money penalties. 
•The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the FCA, and civil monetary penalty laws which can be enforced through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, which imposes civil and criminal penalties against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment or approval from Medicare, Medicaid or other government payors that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay to the federal government, with potential liability including mandatory treble damages and significant per-claim penalties. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery. 
•The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute, a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private), and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the AKS, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
•HIPAA, as further amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH) and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose certain requirements, including mandatory contractual terms, on covered entities subject to the rule, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, as well as their respective business associates and their subcontractors that perform services for them that involve the creation, maintenance, receipt, use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of such individually identifiable health information relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, there may be additional federal, state and non-U.S. laws which govern the privacy and security of health and other personal information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
•The U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act and its implementing regulations, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians, nurse practitioners, certified nurse anesthetists, physician assistants, clinical nurse specialists, and certified nurse midwives as well as teaching hospitals. Manufacturers are also required to disclose ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers (physician assistants, nurse practitioners clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists and anesthesiologist assistants, and certified-nurse midwives). In addition, many states also require reporting of payments or other transfers of value, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted, and may have a more prohibitive effect than the Sunshine Act, thus further complicating compliance efforts. 
•Federal government price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs. 
•Federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm customers. 
Additionally, we are subject to state and foreign equivalents of each of the healthcare laws and regulations described above, among others, some of which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of the payor. Many U.S. states have adopted laws similar to the AKS and FCA, and may apply to our business practices, including, but not limited to, research, distribution, sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental payors, including private insurers. In addition, some states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the April 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and/or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America’s Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals. Several states also impose other marketing restrictions or require pharmaceutical companies to make marketing or price disclosures to the state and require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. State and foreign laws, including for example the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective May 2018 also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. There are ambiguities as to what is required to comply with these state requirements and if we fail to comply with an applicable state law requirement we could be subject to penalties. Finally, there are state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by the national anti-bribery laws of EU Member States, such as the UK Bribery Act 2010. Violation of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.
Payments made to physicians in certain EU Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his or her competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct applicable in the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
The scope and enforcement of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Ensuring that our internal operations and future business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, reputational harm, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, as well as additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws. Further, defending against any such actions can be costly and time-consuming, and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to not be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs and individual imprisonment. If any of the above occur, our ability to operate our business and our results of operations could be adversely affected.
Insurance Coverage and Reimbursement 
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the CMS, an agency within HHS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. No uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Additionally, companies may also need to provide discounts to purchasers, private health plans or government healthcare programs. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, our operations and financial condition. Additionally, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. 
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. Further, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, millions of individuals have lost or will be losing employer-based insurance coverage, which may adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products.
Current and future healthcare reform legislation 
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare, and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. The ACA includes provisions of importance to our potential product candidates that: 
•created an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic products, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs; 
•expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability; 
•expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price,” or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices; 
•addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; 
•expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program; 
•established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide point-of-sale-discounts off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and 
•created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. 
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, Congressional and executive challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact our business. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted: 
•In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, unless additional Congressional action is taken.
•In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
•On April 13, 2017, CMS published a final rule that gives states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.
•On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. 
•On May 23, 2019, CMS published a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. 
•On December 20, 2019, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act was signed into law (H.R. 1865), which repealed the Cadillac tax, the health insurance provider tax, and the medical device excise tax. It is impossible to determine whether similar taxes could be instated in the future.
•In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, was signed into law and includes several provisions that may impact our business to varying degrees, including provisions that reduce the out-of-pocket cap for Medicare Part D beneficiaries to $2,000 starting in 2025; impose new manufacturer financial liability on certain drugs under Medicare Part D; allow the U.S. government to negotiate Medicare Part B and Part D price caps for certain high-cost drugs and biologics without generic or biosimilar competition, including small molecule drugs; and require companies to pay rebates to Medicare for certain drug prices that increase faster than inflation, also including small molecule drugs. 
Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. Specifically, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, and review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs. At the federal level, President Biden signed an Executive Order on July 9, 2021 affirming the administration’s policy to (i) support legislative reforms that would lower the prices of prescription drug and biologics, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation caps, and, by supporting the development and market entry of lower-cost generic drugs and biosimilars; and (ii) support the enactment of a public health insurance option. Among other things, the Executive Order also directs HHS to provide a report on actions to combat excessive pricing of prescription drugs, enhance the domestic drug supply chain, reduce the price that the Federal government pays for drugs, and address price gouging in the industry; and directs the FDA to work with states and Indian Tribes that propose to develop section 804 Importation Programs in accordance with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, and the FDA’s implementing regulations. FDA released such implementing regulations on September 24, 2020, which went into effect on November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. On September 25, 2020, CMS stated drugs imported by states under this rule will not be eligible for federal rebates under Section 1927 of the Social Security Act and manufacturers would not report these drugs for “best price” or Average Manufacturer Price purposes. Since these drugs are not considered covered outpatient drugs, CMS further stated it will not publish a National Average Drug Acquisition Cost for these drugs. If implemented, importation of drugs from Canada may materially and adversely affect the price we receive for any of our product candidates. 
On November 30, 2020, HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to court order, the removal and addition of the aforementioned safe harbors were delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2026. The IRA further extended the delay in implementing this rule under 2032. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
Outside the United States, ensuring coverage and adequate payment for a product also involves challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with government authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory approval for a product and may require a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of a product to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in commercialization. 
Some of our manufacturers are located outside of the United States. There is currently significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.S. and various other countries, including China, with respect to trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs. Increased tariffs could potentially disrupt our existing supply chains and impose additional costs on our business. Additionally, it is possible further tariffs may be imposed that could affect imports of active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, used in our product candidates, or our business may be adversely impacted by retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries, including restricted access to such raw materials used in our product candidates. Given the unpredictable regulatory environment in China and the U.S. and uncertainty regarding how the U.S. or foreign governments will act with respect to tariffs, international trade agreements and policies, further governmental action related to tariffs, additional taxes, regulatory changes or other retaliatory trade measures in the future could occur with a corresponding detrimental impact on our business and financial condition.
In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the EU provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. EU Member States may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the EU have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the EU. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU Member States, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries. 
Compliance with other federal and state laws or requirements; changing legal requirements 
If any products that we may develop are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, labeling, packaging, distribution, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, among other requirements to we may be subject. 
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. 
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, relabeling or repackaging, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any claim or action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on marketing, sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way. 
Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling or packaging; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business. 
Other U.S. environmental, health and safety laws and regulations 
We may be subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. 
We maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us. 
In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions. 
Government regulation of drugs outside of the United States 
To market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization or identification of an alternate regulatory pathway, manufacturing, commercial sales and distribution of our products. For instance, in the EU, medicinal products, are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulation by regulatory authorities at both the EU and national levels. 
•Centralized procedure—If pursuing marketing authorization of a product candidate for a therapeutic indication under the centralized procedure, following the opining of the European Medicines Agency’s, or EMA, Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, the European Commission issues a single marketing authorization valid across the EU, and in the additional Member States of the European Economic Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines derived from biotechnology processes or advanced therapy medicinal products (such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue engineered products), products that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, viral diseases, and designated orphan medicines. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned contains a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health in the EU. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of an MAA considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, it provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who makes the final decision to grant a marketing authorization, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days, excluding clock stops, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. 
•National authorization procedures—There are also two other possible routes to authorize products for therapeutic indications in several countries, which are available for products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure: 
◦Decentralized procedure—Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. 
◦Mutual recognition procedure—In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, additional marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization. 
Under the above described procedures, before granting the marketing authorization, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EU make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
Now that the United Kingdom (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) has left the European Union, Great Britain will no longer be covered by centralized marketing authorizations (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, centralized marketing authorizations will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with a current centralized marketing authorization were automatically converted to Great Britain marketing authorizations on January 1, 2021. For a period of two years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, the UK medicines regulator, may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain marketing authorization. A separate application will, however, still be required. The MHRA also has the power to have regard to marketing authorizations approved in EU Member States through decentralized or mutual recognition procedures with a view to more quickly granting a marketing authorization in the United Kingdom or Great Britain.
In the EU, new products for therapeutic indications that are authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period, if granted, prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU for a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed in the EU until the expiration of the market exclusivity period. The ten-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies. There is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EMA to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Even if a product is considered to be an innovative medicinal product so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company could nevertheless also market another version of the product if such company obtained a marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete, independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EU are similar in principle to those in the United States. In the EU a medicinal product may be designated as orphan medicinal product if it meets the following criteria: (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) without the benefits derived from orphan status, it is unlikely that the marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient return in the EU to justify the necessary investment in its development; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product would be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. During this ten-year orphan market exclusivity period, no MAA shall be accepted, and no marketing authorization shall be granted for a similar medicinal product. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the EU for pediatric studies. The ten-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Otherwise, orphan medicine marketing exclusivity may be revoked only in very select cases, such as if (i) it is established that a similar medicinal product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the authorized product; (ii) the marketing authorization holder of the authorized orphan product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (iii) the marketing authorization holder of the authorized orphan product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
Since January 1, 2021, a separate process for orphan designation has applied in Great Britain. There is now no pre-marketing authorization orphan designation (as there is in the EU) in Great Britain and the application for orphan designation will be reviewed by the MHRA at the time of an MAA for a UK or Great Britain marketing authorization. The criteria for orphan designation are the same as in the EU, save that they apply to Great Britain only (e.g. there must be no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned in Great Britain, as opposed to the EU, and the prevalence of the relevant condition must not be more than 5 in 10,000 in Great Britain). In May 2017, the EU adopted the Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices, or IVDR, which will become applicable on 26 May 2022 and will repeal Directive 98/79/EC on in vitro diagnostic medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of the IVDR will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the general safety and performance requirements of the IVDR, and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout the EU (in-vitro diagnostic medical devices cannot be marketed in the EU without a CE Mark). The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a third-party assessment by a “Notified Body”. This third-party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer’s product.
Similar to the United States, the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls. 
In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014 (Clinical Trials Regulation) was adopted, which replaced the Clinical Trials Directive 2011/20/EC on January 31, 2022. The Clinical Trials Regulation is directly applicable in all the EU Member States, meaning no national implementing legislation is required. The transitory provisions of the new Regulation offer sponsors the possibility to choose between the requirements of the previous Directive and the new Regulation if the request for authorization of a clinical trial is submitted in the year after the new Regulation became applicable. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation became applicable the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial. The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EU. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point, the Clinical Trials Information Systems, or “CTIS”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by coordinated assessment of the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned), of the review of a Reference Member State. Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation. 
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area, or EEA, which consists of the EU Member States, plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
The collection and use of personal health data in the EEA, previously governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive, is now governed by the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. While the Data Protection Directive did not apply to organizations based outside the EEA, the GDPR has expanded its reach to include any business, regardless of its location, that provides goods or services to residents in the EU. This expansion would incorporate any clinical trial activities in EU Members States. The GDPR imposes strict requirements on controllers and processors of personal data, including special protections for “sensitive information” which includes health and genetic information of data subjects residing in the EEA. GDPR grants individuals the opportunity to object to the processing of their personal information, allows them to request deletion of personal information in certain circumstances, and provides the individual with an express right to seek legal remedies in the event the individual believes his or her rights have been violated. Further, the GDPR imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EEA to the United States or other regions that have not been deemed to offer “adequate” privacy protections. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EEA Member States, which may deviate slightly from the GDPR, may result in fines of up to 4% of global revenues, or €20 million, whichever is greater. As a result of the implementation of the GDPR, we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. In addition, further to the UK’s exit from the EU on January 31, 2020, the GDPR ceased to apply in the UK at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. However, as of January 1, 2021, the UK’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law, referred to as the UK GDPR. The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the UK’s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the EU’s data protection regime. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. Although the UK is regarded as a third country under the EU’s GDPR, the European Commission has now issued a decision recognizing the UK as providing adequate protection under the EU GDPR and, therefore, transfers of personal data originating in the EU to the UK remain unrestricted. Like the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the UK to countries not regarded by the UK as providing adequate protection. The UK government has confirmed that personal data transfers from the UK to the EEA remain free flowing.
There is significant uncertainty related to the manner in which data protection authorities will seek to enforce compliance with GDPR. For example, it is not clear if the authorities will conduct random audits of companies doing business in the EEA, or if the authorities will wait for complaints to be filed by individuals who claim their rights have been violated. Enforcement uncertainty and the costs associated with ensuring GDPR compliance are onerous and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
Should we utilize third-party distributors, compliance with such foreign governmental regulations would generally be the responsibility of such distributors, who may be independent contractors over whom we have limited control. 
Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom 
On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). The United Kingdom formally left the European Union on January 31, 2020. There was an initial transitional period, during which European Union’s rules continued to apply in the United Kingdom, which ended on December 31, 2020. The United Kingdom and European Union have signed a European Union-United Kingdom Trade and Cooperation Agreement, or the TCA, which was provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations. At present, Great Britain has implemented EU legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the EU regulatory framework will continue to apply in Northern Ireland). The regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore largely aligns with current EU regulations, however it is possible that these regimes will diverge in the future now that Great Britain’s regulatory system is independent from the EU and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical legislation.
