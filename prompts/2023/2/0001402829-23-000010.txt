Services Provided
Marine Construction Services
Marine construction services include construction, restoration, dredging, maintenance and repair of marine transportation facilities, marine pipelines, bridges and causeways, and marine environmental structures. We have the capability of providing design-build services and typically serve as the prime contractor for these types of projects.
Marine transportation facility projects include building or rehabilitating public port facilities for container ship loading and unloading; cruise ship port facilities; private terminals; special-use Navy terminals; recreational use marinas and docks; and other marine-based facilities. These projects typically require the positioning and installation of steel or 

4



concrete fabrication dock or mooring structures designed for durability and longevity, and involve driving piles of concrete, pipe or sheet pile to provide a foundation for the port facility structure that we subsequently construct on the piles. We also provide on-going maintenance and repair, inspection services, emergency repair, and demolition and salvage services to such facilities.
Our marine pipeline service projects generally include the installation and removal of underwater buried pipeline transmission lines; installation of pipeline intakes and outfalls for industrial facilities; construction of pipeline outfalls for wastewater and industrial discharges; river crossing and directional drilling; creation of hot taps and tie-ins; and inspection, maintenance and repair services.
Our bridge and causeway projects include the construction, repair and maintenance of all types of overwater bridges and causeways, as well as the development of fendering systems in marine environments. We serve as the prime contractor for many of these projects, and some of these are design-build contracts. These projects involve fabricating steel or concrete structures designed for durability and longevity, and involve driving concrete, pipe or sheet pile into the subsurface to create support for the concrete deck roadways that we subsequently construct on the piles. These piles can exceed four feet in diameter, can range up to 170 feet in overall length, and are often driven 90 feet into the sea or river floor. We do not control the funding of bridge and causeway work, which has not been consistently available.
Marine environmental structure projects may include the installation of concrete mattresses to promote erosion protection; construction of levees to contain environmental mitigation projects, and the installation of geotubes for wetlands and island creation. Such structures are used for erosion control, wetlands creation and environmental remediation.
Dredging generally enhances or preserves the navigability of waterways or the protection of shorelines through the removal or replenishment of soil, sand or rock. Dredging involves the removal of mud and silt from the channel floor by means of a mechanical backhoe, crane and bucket or cutter suction dredge and pipeline systems. Dredging is integral to marine capital and maintenance projects, including: maintenance for previously deepened waterways and harbors to remove silt, sand and other accumulated sediments; construction of breakwaters, jetties, canals and other marine structures; deepening ship channels and wharves to accommodate larger and deeper draft ships; containing erosion of wetlands and coastal marshes; land reclamation; and beach nourishment and creation of wildlife refuges. Maintenance dredging projects are a source of recurring revenue as active channels typically require routine dredging due to natural sedimentation. The frequency of maintenance dredging may be accelerated by heavy rainfall or major weather events such as hurricanes. Areas where no natural deep water ports exist, such as the Texas Gulf Coast, require substantial dredging. We maintain multiple specialty dredges of various sizes and specifications to meet customer needs. Our dredging services are typically combined with our marine construction services to provide a turn-key solution for our customers.
Our specialty services include design, salvage, demolition, surveying, towing, diving and underwater inspection, excavation and repair. Our diving services are largely performed in shallow water and include inspections, salvage and pile restoration and encapsulation. Our survey services include surveying pipelines and performing hydrographic surveys which determine the configuration of the floors of bodies of water and detect and identify wrecks and other obstructions. Most of these specialty services support our other services or provide an introductory opportunity to other customers.
Concrete Construction Services 
The concrete segment has earned a reputation as one of the most recognizable and reputable concrete contractors where we operate. Our success has been achieved by maintaining a focus on our clients and addressing their problems. The commercial construction arena has been our focus and we have completed thousands of successful commercial projects – both simple and complex in the broader Texas market including Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth, Austin and San Antonio. Our portfolio of commercial projects includes warehouse and distribution, medical, retail, education, office buildings, multi-family, religious, industrial and community projects – nearly the full spectrum of commercial construction projects. We are a turnkey subcontractor that performs the vast majority of all our work with our own labor forces.
Warehouse and distribution projects include large, intermediate and small facilities serving needs in nearly every commercial, private and public industry. Typically, the developer and builders construction method of choice for these projects are concrete tilt-wall structures ranging in size from a few thousand square feet to over one million square feet. 

5



Speed, efficiency and quality are keys to meeting our clients’ needs to deliver projects on or ahead of schedule. We have received awards for many of these projects.
Medical/healthcare projects always come with stringent requirements. We have the knowledge and experience to meet these high expectations. From hospitals to laboratories, including high rises and their garages, we know how to carry out construction activities in densely occupied areas with minimal disturbance to critical facilities daily operations.
We apply our concrete experience to a variety of office building project types, including low, mid-rise and high-rise concrete structures, whether in downtown metropolitan cities or in business districts serving neighboring communities. We utilize different technologies for elevated concrete structures, such as high-rise concrete structures.
We have the abundant knowledge of the extensive formwork systems, cranes and equipment needed to successfully deliver multi-family projects – typically in tight spaces, whether it be podium structures, mid-rise, high-rise and luxury projects. We have earned the reputation for successfully managing and delivering multi-family projects with aggressive schedules.
We bring a breadth of knowledge and a diverse portfolio of education projects. We have completed over 20 million square feet of education projects including libraries, higher education, research facilities, athletic facilities, stadiums, elementary, middle and high schools. We have also applied our skills to state of the art performing arts facilities and studios.
Retail centers play an important role for serving our neighborhoods. They address a variety of community needs and we have had the opportunity to build large regional shopping malls, national chain stores, power centers, small strip centers and corner retail shops.
We also have had the great privilege of teaming with church leaders and church builders to create worship areas for people from all walks of life. With more than 5 million square feet of worship and fellowship facilities, our religious portfolio includes projects ranging from 2,000 square feet to more than 200,000 square feet.
Industry and Market Overview
Marine Segment
We provide our services to similar customers, or in some cases, the same customers, across the markets served by our business. Our marine segment customers may be in diverse end markets, including port expansion and maintenance, bridges, causeways and other marine infrastructure, the recreational waterside industry, the U.S. Department of Defense, the energy industry, coastal protection and reclamation, along with hurricane restoration and repair and environmental remediation. We believe that this broad customer base enables us to lessen the negative effects during a downturn in a specific end market and respond quickly to the needs of expanding end markets. The following includes an overview of our diverse markets in the marine construction industry:
Port Expansion and Maintenance
Expected increases in cargo volume and future demands from larger ships transiting the expanded Panama Canal will require ports, especially along the Gulf Coast and Atlantic Seaboard, to expand their dock capacity and port infrastructure to accommodate larger container ships and increased cargo volumes, as well as perform additional dredging services to deepen and maintain their channels. We provide customers in this sector turnkey services to meet all their port expansion and maintenance work.
Bridges and Causeways
According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, as of their most recent report, one in thirteen of the nation’s bridges are structurally deficient, and the average age of the nation’s bridges is 45 years old. We are able to construct or restore overwater bridges, and design, repair, or replace, fendering systems for customers.
Marine Infrastructure
The U.S. Marine Transportation System (“MTS”) consists of waterways, ports and their intermodal connections, vessels, vehicles, and system users, as well as shipyards and repair facilities crucial to maritime activity. The MTS is primarily owned and operated through an aggregation of federal, state, and local governmental authorities, as well as privately owned facilities and private companies. U.S. inland and intracoastal waterways require continuous maintenance and improvement. While waterway usage is increasing, the facilities and supporting systems are aging. In addition, channels 

6



and waterways must maintain certain depths to accommodate ship and barge traffic. Natural sedimentation in these channels and waterways require routine maintenance dredging to maintain navigability.
Our full business complement, including design, dredging, marine construction, and specialty services, such as diving, survey, and inspections, are fully utilized by our customers to meet all their marine infrastructure project needs.
Recreational Waterside Industry
An increase in the number and size of cruise ships has generated a need for substantial port infrastructure development, including planning and construction of new terminals and facilities, as well as on-going maintenance and repair services. These larger vessels require the development of new mooring structures as well as additional dredging services to accommodate deeper drafts. Our service area includes, among others, the ports of Miami, Galveston, Tampa, New Orleans, Canaveral, Juneau, Tacoma, Seattle and the Caribbean Basin, which includes numerous cruise facilities and is the most popular cruise destination in the North American market.
The Department of Defense and Homeland Security
The U.S. Navy has the responsibility for the maintenance of 40 facilities in the United States, which includes a significant amount of marine infrastructure. We believe the U.S. Navy will continue to maintain strategic facilities, including required maintenance and upgrades to its marine facility infrastructure.
The U.S. Coast Guard maintains more than 50,000 federal aids to navigation, which include buoys, lighthouses, day beacons, and radio-navigation signals. Additionally, it has oversight responsibility for approximately 20,000 highway and railroad bridges that span navigable waterways throughout the country. As part of the Department of Homeland Security, we anticipate that the U.S. Coast Guard’s needs for varied marine construction services, including those listed above, will provide opportunities for us in the future.
Energy Industry
We design, construct, repair and remove underwater pipelines, and provide marine construction, dredging, and on-going maintenance services for private refineries, terminal facilities and docks, and other critical areas near shore oil and gas infrastructure.
U.S. Coastal and Wetland Restoration and Reclamation
Increases in coastal population density and demographic trends, along with the potential effects of rising sea-levels, will lead to an increase in the number of coastal restoration and reclamation projects, and as the value of waterside assets rises from a residential and recreational standpoint, the private sector, government agencies and municipalities will increase spending on restoration and reclamation projects.
Hurricane Restoration and Repair
Hurricanes are often very destructive to the existing marine infrastructure and natural protection barriers of the prime storm areas of the Gulf Coast, the Atlantic Seaboard, and the Caribbean Basin, including bridges, ports, underwater channels and sensitive coastal areas. Typically, restoration and repair opportunities continue for several years after a major hurricane event. These events provide incremental projects to our industry that contribute to a favorable bidding environment and high-capacity utilization in our markets during such times.
Environmental Remediation
We believe there will be additional funding for the protection of natural habitats, environmental preservation, wetlands creation and remediation for high priority projects in Louisiana and other areas in the markets we serve that will protect and restore sensitive marine and coastal areas, advance ocean science and research, and ensure sustainable use of ocean resources.
Concrete Segment
We provide our services to different customers across the markets served by our business. Our customers in the concrete segment are in diverse end markets such as industrial, institutional, commercial real estate, and recreational developments.
We believe that this broad customer base enables us to lessen the negative effects during a downturn in a specific end market and respond quickly to the needs of expanding end markets. The following includes an overview of our diverse markets in the concrete industry:

7



Industrial developments
Our industrial markets include manufacturing plants, industrial warehousing, distribution centers, wastewater treatment facilities and facilities supporting the petrochemical industry. An expected increase in distribution has generated a need for substantial industrial park developments.
Institutional developments and expansions
Our institutional markets include educational facilities, medical facilities, museums, and religious developments. Due to significant population growth in the metropolitan areas of Texas, there has been great demand for institutional development and expansion. Additionally, as population and suburban areas grow, so does the continued need for medical and educational facilities.
Structural developments
Our structural markets include mid- and high-rise multi-family living, single and multi-story office buildings, parking garages, shopping malls, and other multi-story buildings. Continued growth in business expansions and relocations to Texas are driving an increase in the need for office space and apartment complexes.
Retail developments
As population continues to grow, so does the need for retail developments, such as grocery stores, shopping malls, restaurants, free standing retail outlets, and other entertainment venues.
Recreational developments
Our recreational markets include a wide range of hotels, sports venues, and stadiums. The increase in new businesses and new educational facilities has sparked the need for additional hotels and stadiums across the metropolitan areas of Texas.
Customers
Our customers in the marine segment include federal, state and local governmental agencies as well as private commercial and industrial enterprises in the United States and the Caribbean Basin. Customers in our concrete segment include general contractors along with owners and developers of medical facilities, religious developments, sports complexes and stadiums, school districts and developers, owners of industrial, commercial and residential buildings, and some governmental agencies across the metropolitan areas of Texas. Most projects are competitively bid, with the award typically going to the lowest qualified bidder. Our customer base shifts from time to time depending on the types of projects we bid, and ultimately are successful on obtaining.
​
The following table represents contract revenue and concentrations of contract revenue by type of customer for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
------------------------+---+------+---------+---+-----+------+---+---------+---+------+---+---+---------+---+-----+--
​ | | 2022 | | % | | 2021 | | % | | 2020 | | % | 
Federal Government | ​ | $ | 80,116 | | 11 | % | $ | 54,480 | | 9 | % | $ | 51,793 | | 7 | %
State Governments | ​ | | 62,516 | | 8 | % | | 4,790 | | 1 | % | | 27,574 | | 4 | %
Local Governments | ​ | | 125,015 | | 17 | % | | 120,311 | | 20 | % | | 202,839 | | 29 | %
Private Companies | ​ | | 480,675 | | 64 | % | | 421,779 | | 70 | % | | 427,736 | | 60 | %
Total contract revenues | ​ | $ | 748,322 | | 100 | % | $ | 601,360 | | 100 | % | $ | 709,942 | | 100 | %

​
We do not believe that the loss of any one customer would have a material adverse effect on our operations since no single customer sustains a large portion of our contract revenue over time.
Fluctuations in Quarterly Results
Our quarterly revenues and results of operations may fluctuate significantly depending upon the mix, size, scope, and progress schedules of our projects under contract, permitting, weather or other delays, the productivity of our labor force and the utilization of our equipment. These factors, as well as others, affect the rate at which revenue is recognized as projects are completed.
Competition
In our marine segment, we compete with several regional marine construction services companies and a few national marine construction services companies. In the past, interest groups have unsuccessfully lobbied Congress to modify or 

8



repeal the Jones Act to facilitate foreign flag competition for trades and cargos currently reserved for U.S. flag vessels under the Jones Act. If these efforts are ever successful, it could result in significantly increased competition and have a material adverse effect on our marine segment business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. From time to time, we compete with certain national land-based heavy civil contractors. In our concrete segment, we compete mostly in the private sector and our competitors range from small, local construction companies to large regional and national construction companies.
Both of our segments are highly fragmented with competitors generally varying within the markets we serve and with few competitors competing in all of the markets we serve or for all of the services that we provide. We believe that our turnkey capability, expertise, experience and reputation for providing safe and timely quality services, safety record and programs, versatile equipment fleet, financial strength, surety bonding capacity, knowledge of local markets and conditions, and project management and estimating abilities allow us to compete effectively. We believe significant barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate, including the ability to bond large projects, maritime law constraints, specialized marine equipment and technical experience; however, a U.S. company that has adequate financial resources, access to technical expertise, and specialized equipment may become a competitor.
Insurance and Bonding
We maintain general and excess liability, construction equipment, workers’ compensation and other forms of insurance; all in amounts adequate for our operating needs and consistent with industry practice.
 In connection with both segments of the business, we often are required to provide various types of surety bonds that provide security for our performance under certain public and private sector contracts. Our ability to obtain surety bonds depends upon our capitalization, adequate working capital, past performance, management expertise, and external factors, including the capacity of the overall surety market. Surety companies consider such factors in light of the amount of our backlog that we have currently bonded and their own current underwriting standards, which may change from time to time. The capacity of the surety market is subject to market-driven fluctuations driven primarily by the level of surety industry losses and the degree of surety market consolidation. Although we do not believe that fluctuations in surety market capacity have significantly affected our ability to grow our business, there is no assurance that it will not significantly affect our ability to obtain new contracts in the future. The bonds we provide typically are for the contract amount of the project. At December 31, 2022, the capacity under our current bonding arrangement was at least $750 million, with approximately $175 million of projects being bonded. We believe our strong balance sheet and working capital position will allow us to continue to access our bonding capacity.
Trade Names
We operate under a number of trade names. We consolidate our operations under the brand name “Orion Group Holdings, Inc.” We may be known as Orion Marine Group, Orion Marine Construction, Orion Marine Contractors, Orion Construction, East and West Jones Placement Area, Schneider E&C, Orion Industrial Construction, Orion Concrete Construction, T.A.S. Commercial Concrete Construction, T.A.S. Commercial Concrete Solutions, T.A.S. Proco, or Houston Industrial Tool Services. We do not generally register our trademarks with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office, but instead rely on state and common law protections. While we consider our trade names to be valuable assets, we do not consider any single trademark or trade name to be of such material importance that its absence would cause a material disruption of our business.
Equipment
We operate and maintain a large and diverse equipment fleet in our marine and concrete segments, substantially all of which we own, that includes the following:

● | Barges - spud barges, material barges, deck barges, anchor barges, hopper barges, and fuel barges. These vessels are used to provide work platforms for cranes and other equipment, to transport materials to the project site and to provide support for the project at the project site.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Dayboats - small pushboats, dredge tenders and skiffs are used to shift barges at the project site, to move personnel and to provide general support to the project site.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9




● | Tugs - larger pushboats and tug boats are used to transport barges and other support equipment to and from the project site.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Dredges - 24” cutter head suction dredges (diesel), 20” cutter head suction dredge (diesel/electric), 20” cutter head suction dredges (diesel), 16” cutter head suction dredges, and 12” portable cutter head suction dredges are used to provide dredging services at project sites.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cranes - crawler lattice boom cranes with lift capability from 50 tons to 400 tons and hydraulic rough terrain cranes with lift capability from 15 tons to 60 tons are used to provide lifting and pile driving capabilities on project sites, and to provide bucket work, including mechanical dredging and dragline work, to project sites.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Tower Cranes - Capable of being assembled to reach heights of 600 feet and have a capacity of 44,000 pounds with a maximum of 242 foot working radius.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pump Trucks - concrete pump trucks are large, diesel-powered trucks mounted with a powerful pump, and an extendable, sectioned hose or cylinder to help facilitate the placement of concrete for construction projects.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Laser Screeds - laser screeds are self-propelled four wheel drive, four wheel steer units that encompass a 20’ telescoping boom with a 12’ wide placement head. The screed head itself consists of 3 parts: the plow, the auger, and the vibrator. The plow disperses the concrete evenly, the auger removes the excess material to finished grade, and the vibrator smooths the surface. The screed has an on board computer system able to determine the correct elevation height and provide commands for elevation control.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe that ownership of certain equipment is generally preferable to leased or rented equipment in some cases because it ensures the equipment is available as needed and normally results in lower costs. We continually monitor and adjust our fleet size so that it is consistent with the size of the business, considering both existing backlog and expected future work. We believe that our equipment is well maintained and suitable for our current operations. We have the ability to extend the useful life of our equipment through capital refurbishment at periodic intervals. Most of our fleet is serviced by our own mechanics who work at various maintenance sites and facilities. We are also capable of building, and have built, much of our highly specialized equipment. Our strategy is to deploy our fleet from project to project as required. 
Equipment Certification
In our marine segment, some of our equipment requires certification by the U.S. Coast Guard. All equipment which requires certification has obtained such certification and is maintained in good standing thereunder. In addition, where required, our vessels’ permissible loading capacities require certification by the American Bureau of Shipping (“ABS”). The ABS is an independent classification society which certifies that certain of our larger, seagoing vessels are “in-class,” signifying that the vessels have been built and maintained in accordance with ABS standards and applicable U.S. Coast Guard rules and regulations. All of our vessels that are required to be certified by the ABS have been certified as “in-class.” These certifications indicate that the vessels are structurally capable of operating in open waters, which enhances the mobility of our fleet.
Government Regulations
We are required to comply with the macro regulatory requirements of federal, state and local governmental agencies and authorities including the following:

● | regulations concerning workplace safety, labor relations and disadvantaged businesses;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | licensing requirements applicable to shipping and dredging; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | permitting and inspection requirements applicable to marine construction projects.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In our marine segment, we are also subject to government regulations pursuant to the Foreign Dredge Act, the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, commonly referred to as the "Jones Act", the Shipping Act and the Vessel Documentation Act. These statutes require vessels engaged in the transport of merchandise or passengers between two points in the United States or dredging in the navigable waters of the U.S. to be documented with a coastwise endorsement, to be owned and controlled by U.S. citizens, to be manned by U.S. crews, and to be built in the U.S. The U.S. citizenship ownership and control standards require the vessel-owning entity to be at least 75% U.S. citizen owned and prohibit the demise or bareboat 

10



chartering of the vessel to any entity that does not meet the 75% U.S. citizen ownership test. These statutes, together with similar requirements for other sectors of the maritime industry, are collectively referred to as “cabotage” laws.
In both our marine and concrete segments, we are subject to the requirements of OSHA and certain regulations for the EPA.
We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and have all material licenses required to conduct our operations.
Environmental Matters
General
Our activities, including concrete construction, infrastructure construction, salvage, demolition, dredging and dredge material disposal activities are subject to stringent and complex federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, including air emissions, water quality, solid waste management, marine and bird species and their habitats, and wetlands. A portion of our construction contracts are entered into with public authorities and frequently impose additional governmental requirements, including those related to environmental concerns.
Such laws and regulations may require that both segments and their customers obtain, and comply with, various environmental permits, registrations, licenses and other approvals. These laws and regulations also can restrict or impact the business activities in many ways, such as delaying the appropriation and performance of particular projects; restricting the way we handle or dispose of wastes; requiring remedial action to mitigate pollution conditions that may be caused by our operations or that are attributable to others; and enjoining some or all of our operations deemed in non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations.
We believe that compliance with existing federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. In addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. The following is a discussion of the environmental laws and regulations that could have a material effect on our marine and concrete construction services.
Waste Management
Our operations could be subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state laws, which impose detailed requirements for the handling, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes. Under the auspices of the EPA, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent, requirements. Generators of hazardous wastes must comply with certain standards for the accumulation and storage of hazardous wastes, as well as recordkeeping and reporting requirements applicable to hazardous waste storage and disposal activities.
Site Remediation
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as “Superfund,” and comparable state laws and regulations impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. Such classes of persons include the current and past owners or operators of sites where a hazardous substance was released, and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at offsite locations, such as landfills. CERCLA authorizes the EPA, and in some cases third parties, to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, neighboring landowners and other third parties often file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.

We currently own or lease properties that have been used by other industries for a number of years. Although we typically have used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us, on or under other locations where such substances have been taken for disposal, or on or under project sites where we perform work. In addition, some of the properties may have been operated by third parties or by previous owners whose treatment and disposal or release of wastes was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination, or to perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination.
Water Discharges
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), and analogous state laws impose strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States, including wetlands. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. The CWA also regulates the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S., and activities that result in such discharge generally require permits issued by the Corps of Engineers. Moreover, above ground storage of petroleum products is strictly regulated under the CWA. Under the CWA, federal and state regulatory agencies may impose administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations.
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”), which amends and augments the CWA, establishes strict liability for owners and operators of facilities that are sites of releases of oil into waters of the U.S. OPA and its associated regulations impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills. For instance, OPA requires vessel owners and operators to establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to cover liabilities related to an oil spill for which such parties are statutorily responsible. We believe we are in compliance with all applicable OPA financial responsibility obligations and equipment requirements.
In 2009, regulations promulgated by the EPA covering certain previously exempt discharges to water from certain marine vessels became effective. The regulations provide for a general permit to cover such discharges and impose on marine vessel operators, including us, certain discharge, permitting, record keeping, reporting, monitoring, maintenance, and operating restrictions and requirements with respect to materials that are or may be discharged from certain vessels. The applicability of these restrictions and requirements is based on size and type of vessel, and they apply only to a minority of our vessels. We, nevertheless, are implementing such restrictions and requirements with respect to our vessels which are subject thereto, and we do not anticipate that such regulations or the associated permit terms, restrictions and requirements will adversely impact our business and results of operations.
Air Emissions
The Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including paint booths, and may require pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain facilities expected to produce air emissions, impose stringent air permit requirements, or require the utilization of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the CAA.
Endangered Species
The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) restricts activities that may affect endangered species or their habitats. We conduct activities in or near areas that may be designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species. For instance, seasonal observation of endangered or threatened West Indian Manatees adjacent to work areas may impact construction operations in Florida during the winter months. Additionally, our dredging operations in Florida are impacted by limitations for placement of dredge spoil materials on designated spoil disposal islands, from April through August of each year, when the islands are inhabited by nesting colonies of protected bird species. Further, restrictions on work during the Whooping Crane nesting period in the Aransas Pass National Wildlife Refuge from October 1 through April 15 each year and during the non-dormant grass season for sea grass in the Laguna Madre from March 1 through November 30 each year impact our construction operations in the Texas Gulf Coast area. We plan our operations and bidding activity with these restrictions and limitations in mind, and they have not materially hindered our business in the past. However, these and other restrictions may affect our ability to obtain work or to complete our projects on time in the future. In addition, while

we believe that we are in material compliance with the ESA, the discovery of previously unidentified endangered species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected area.
Climate Change
The U.S. Congress may consider legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in response to climate change concerns. In addition, several states have declined to wait on Congress to develop and implement climate control legislation and have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by Congress or various states, or the adoption of regulations by the EPA and analogous state agencies that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business could have an adverse effect on our operations and demand for our services.
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2022, our marine segment had 868 employees, 286 of whom were full-time salaried personnel and most of the remainder of whom were hourly personnel. Our concrete segment had 1,348 employees, 197 of whom were full-time salaried personnel and most of the remainder were hourly personnel.
From time to time, we hire additional employees for certain large projects and, subject to local market conditions, additional crew members are generally available for hire on relatively short notice. We believe our employees are our most valuable resource, and our workforce possesses a strong dedication to and pride in our company. Our employees are not currently represented by labor unions, except certain employees in our marine segment located in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska and certain employees operating specialized equipment for our concrete segment, in respect of which collective bargaining agreements are in place. Employees represented by collective bargaining agreements represent approximately 4.3% of our total workforce. 
Financial Information About Geographic Areas
We are a project-driven marine and concrete contractor, and our operations represent two reportable segments for financial reporting. Our business is primarily conducted along the coastal regions of the United States for our marine segment and in the metropolitan areas of Texas for our concrete segment. Revenues generated from our marine segment outside the United States, primarily in the Caribbean Basin and Mexico, totaled 0.9%, 0.5%, and 1.8% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our long-lived assets are substantially located in the United States.
