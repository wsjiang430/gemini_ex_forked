 Item 1.   Business. 

Introduction

Electro-Sensors, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” or “ESI”) manufactures and sells industrial production monitoring and process control systems. 

In addition, we may periodically make strategic investments in other businesses and companies, including investments that we believe would facilitate the development of technology complementary to our existing products or investments that we believe present good opportunities for the Company and its shareholders.  

ESI was incorporated in Minnesota in July 1968. Our executive offices are located at 6111 Blue Circle Drive, Minnetonka, Minnesota, 55343-9108. Our telephone number is (952) 930-0100.

Products

We manufacture a complete line of monitoring and control systems for a wide range of industrial machine applications.  The systems measure machine production and operation rates, as well as regulate the speed of related machines in production processes.

Our goal is to develop meaningful annual updates to our standard products.

We have a sales agreement with Motrona GmbH, a German control and interface devices manufacturer, under which we have the right to distribute Motrona products in the United States. These products interface with our products on various applications for motion monitoring.

  Speed Monitoring Systems
Our speed monitoring systems compare revolutions per minute or speed against acceptable rates as determined by our customers. These systems vary in complexity, from simple systems that detect slow-downs or stoppages, to sophisticated systems that warn of deviations from precise tolerances and that permit various subsidiary operations to be determined through monitoring shaft speed.

Our speed monitoring systems also include a line of products that measure production counts or rates, such as number of parts, gallons per minute, or board feet. These speed monitoring systems include alarm systems, tachometers, and other devices that translate impulses from the sensors into alarm signals utilized by our customers.
We have several products used in drive control systems that regulate the speed of motors on related machines in a production sequence to ensure that the performances of various operations are coordinated. The products consist of a line of digital control products for motors that require a complete closed loop PID (Proportional Integral Derivative) control. The closed loop controllers coordinate production speed among process motors and reduce waste.

  Temperature Application Products

Our main temperature applications include bearing, gear box, and motor temperature monitoring sensors.  These sensors alert an operator when the temperature exceeds or is less than a specified temperature.
   Position Application Products

We also offer production monitoring devices that include a belt alignment and slide gate position monitor.  The belt alignment monitor is used to determine if a belt is tracking correctly.  The slide gate position monitor is used in plant operations to provide feedback of the position of a slide gate. 
  Vibration Monitoring Products 

Our vibration monitors alert operators when the vibration of a machine in a production system exceeds or is less than a specified level.

  Tilt Switches

A tilt switch is designed to alert the operator when a storage bin or production system reaches a certain capacity.  

  Hazard Monitoring Systems 

Electro-Sentry We offer the Electro-Sentry 1TM and Electro-Sentry 16TM hazard monitoring systems, which integrate our sensors for monitoring temperature, belt alignment, and shaft speed with programmable control logic to create a complete hazard monitoring system. These systems enable our customers to locate which part of their material handling system is operating incorrectly, typically in less than ten seconds. 

HazardPROTM We market our wireless hazard technology monitoring system under the HazardPRO product name. This integrated hazard monitoring system captures and displays key information in an intuitive format allowing the user to quickly and comprehensively understand the status and history of the user's processes.  The simple but powerful interface provides insight into a customer's internal operations as they strive to maximize safety and facility runtime, while minimizing costs associated with unscheduled maintenance and unplanned downtime.  The HazardPRO system has been approved for use in hazardous dust environments by a third-party nationally recognized testing laboratory.

The HazardPRO site system manager software efficiently collects data from all sensors in a customer's monitoring system, with effective wireless monitoring across a widely dispersed area.  We have also added a complete antenna pair mounting system to the product line for easy and accurate customer installation.
We expect to continue to expend resources to develop new products and to market new and existing products for use in a wide variety of monitoring applications.

Our corporate website, www.electro-sensors.com, provides significant product application information for our existing and prospective customers and our sales partners. Information on our website is not incorporated by reference herein and is not a part of this Form 10-K. 

Marketing and Distribution

We sell our products primarily through both our internal sales team and a number of manufacturer’s representatives and distributors, both nationally and internationally.  In 2022, we had international sales through distributors in the following countries; Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Peru, United Kingdom, Ukraine, Egypt, South Africa, India, Australia, China, the Republic of Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Singapore. Sales to customers outside the United States represented approximately 10% of sales in 2022. We sell our products under the Electro-Sensors, Inc. brand as a range of products from simple sensors to complex integrated monitoring systems.  Our customers operate in a wide range of industries, including grain/feed/milling, bulk materials, manufacturing, food products, ethanol, power generation, and other processing industries.

We continue to explore new industries and applications within the industries we serve to expand sales and may also consider acquiring compatible businesses or product lines as part of our growth strategy.  In addition, we may make strategic investments that we believe present good opportunities for the Company and its shareholders.
In addition to enhanced operational safety, we believe that a wide variety of organizations could achieve significant savings in both time and materials by adding production monitoring and drive control technology to existing processes to coordinate the operation of related machines. We sell our products into both the “retro-fit” market and into new manufacturing or processing systems.

We advertise in national industrial periodicals that cover a range of industries and attend several local, national and international industry tradeshows throughout the year. We also use our corporate website and other related industry websites for advertising and marketing purposes.

Competition

We face substantial competition in the sale of our production monitoring sensors and systems from a broad range of industrial and commercial businesses. Among our competitors are 4B Components Ltd., Maxi-Tronic, Inc., Siemens Corporation, and Ag Growth International Inc. (AGI). We believe our competitive advantages include our products' superior design and quality, and the fact that we sell our products as ready-to-install units that can be used in a wide range of applications. Our major challenges include the fact that several of our competitors are larger, may have better established names, have a broader range of sensing instruments, and have larger sales forces and capital resources.
Suppliers
We purchase parts and materials for our systems from various manufacturers and distributors. In some instances, these materials are manufactured in accordance with our proprietary designs. Multiple sources of these parts and materials are generally available, and we typically do not depend on any single source for these supplies and materials. In 2022, we continued to experience disruptions in our supply chain, resulting in difficulty sourcing parts.  Additionally, we experienced price increases for many of the components used in our products.  In some situations, we have and are modifying product designs to accommodate new components that are more readily available or have a lower cost.  There is no guarantee that we have and will continue to be successful in updating these designs and sourcing alternative components and material.  We also continue to experience periodic delays in our shipping and transportation services, which may affect our ability to make timely deliveries to our customers.  We continue to closely monitor lead times and availability of components.  We are continually assessing our inventory levels and may take actions as necessary to minimize disruptions to our supply chain such as maintaining larger levels of inventories than we have in the past, but these actions may not be successful if significant disruptions occur.
Customers

We do not depend upon a single or a few customers for 10% or more portion of our sales.  

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses 

The Company relies on a combination of patent, trademark, and trade secret laws to establish proprietary right in its products.

We have registered the name “Electro-Sensors” as a trademark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), Reg. No. 1,142,310. We believe this trademark has been and will continue to be useful in developing and protecting market recognition for our products. We established the HazardPRO trademark in the first quarter of 2014 and intend to register this trademark.

We hold six patents relating to our production monitoring systems. We believe strongly in protecting our intellectual property and have a long history of obtaining patents, when available, in connection with our research and product development programs. We also rely upon trade secrets and proprietary know-how.

We seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary intellectual property, including know-how, in part, through confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, and other parties. However, we cannot ensure these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors.

Seasonality

Generally, the Company experiences seasonality in the sale of its products with the second and third calendar quarters historically the strongest.

Business Development Activities

We continue to seek growth opportunities, both internally through our existing portfolio of products, technologies and markets, as well as externally through technology partnerships or related-product or business acquisitions.  In addition, we may make strategic or other investments that we believe present opportunities for the Company and its shareholders.  On June 13, 2022 we announced that we had entered into a merger agreement with Mobile X Global, Inc.  On January 30, 2023, we announced that the merger agreement had been terminated and that the Company's Board of Directors had established a special committee to explore and pursue business development and other strategic alternatives.
Governmental Approvals

Although we are not required to obtain governmental approval of our products, we choose to obtain certain third-party certifications to meet our customers’ needs. These certifications may expand our market opportunities in certain industries.
Effect of Governmental Regulations

We do not believe that any existing or proposed governmental regulations will have a material effect on our business.

Research and Development 

We invest in research and development programs to develop new products and to integrate state-of-the-art technology into our existing products. We undertake development projects based upon the identified specific needs of the markets we serve.  Our "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section further describes our research and development expenditures.

Our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop new products in our varying segments. Difficulties or delays in our ability to develop, produce, test, market, and deliver new products could have a material adverse effect on future sales growth.

Compliance with Environmental Laws

Compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws has only a nominal effect on current or anticipated capital expenditures and has had no material effect on earnings or on our competitive position.
Human Capital 

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 35 employees, all of whom, except one, are full-time and all are based in the United States.  We consider our relations with our employees to be good. None of our employees are currently represented by a labor union.

The Company views its employees and culture as keys to its success.  The Company aims to attract and retain qualified personnel and provides wages and benefits that are competitive locally to reward employees for performance.  The Company values innovation, inclusion and diversity, safety and engagement as we believe these are keys to attract, develop, and retain the best talent.

The health and safety of our employees is our top priority.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company implemented a workplace safety plan, following CDC guidelines and federal and local mandates, to protect employees and minimize the potential risk of an outbreak within the Company.  We believe the Company has generally been successful implementing appropriate measures to protect the health and safety of its employees while maintaining business continuity and high levels of service to our customers.
Our ability to maintain a competitive position and to continue to develop and market new products depends, in part, on our ability to retain key employees and qualified personnel. If we are unable to retain our key employees, or recruit and train others, our product development, marketing and sales could be adversely affected. 
Fluctuations in Operating Results

We have experienced fluctuations in our past operating results and expect to experience fluctuations in the future.  These fluctuations may affect the market price of our common stock. Sales can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include: product competition and acceptance, timing of customer orders, cancellation of orders, the mix of products sold, supply chain disruptions, downturns in the markets we serve, geopolitical events, and economic disruptions such as weather-related events. Because fluctuations may occur, we caution investors that results of our operations for recent periods may not accurately predict how we will perform in the future. We cannot ensure that we will achieve revenue or earnings growth.
Expending Funds for Changes in Industry Standards, Customer Preferences or Technology

Our business depends on our periodically introducing new and enhanced products and solutions for customer needs. Our product development efforts require us to commit financial resources, personnel and time, usually in advance of significant market demand for these products. In order to compete, we must anticipate both future demand and the technology available to meet that demand. We cannot ensure that our research and development efforts will lead to new products or product innovations that can be made available to or will be accepted by the market.
