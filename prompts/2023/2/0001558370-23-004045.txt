Significant Developments in 2021
On March 15, 2021, the Company acquired all assets and assumed all liabilities of Standard Farms OH, a medical cannabis provider focused on cultivation, processing and CO2 extraction for the State of Ohio’s operating dispensaries. The acquisition of Standard Farms OH (the “Standard Farms OH Acquisition”) further expanded the Company’s footprint into a new market, thus providing access to additional customers. The Company’s consideration for the Standard Farms OH Acquisition consisted of $7,550 settled indebtedness to the Company, transferred into ownership interest.
On July 21, 2021, Jupiter entered into a new two-year, $10,000 asset-based revolving credit facility with Entrepreneur Growth Capital, LLC.
On August 24, 2021, the Company announced a partnership with the Shinnecock Nation to establish vertical cannabis operations on their aboriginal tribal territory in the Hamptons on Long Island, New York. Through a joint venture with the Shinnecock Nation’s cannabis project development firm Conor Green, TILT will finance, build and provide management services for the vertical cannabis operations of Shinnecock’s wholly owned cannabis business, Little Beach Harvest. The project will include a cultivation, processing, extraction and packaging facility, a two-story dispensary with drive-thru and an adjacent wellness lounge. A subsidiary of the Company purchased 100% of the Class A membership interests of Standard Farms New York, LLC (“SFNY”), which holds a 75% interest in CGSF Group (“CGSF”), a newly formed joint venture with Conor Green. The Company paid a total of $751 with $400 being paid in cash and $351 paid in Common Shares, in the acquisition of its interests in SFNY and CGSF. Additionally, upon the achievement of certain milestones, the Company will provide for additional consideration of up to 5,673,844 Common Shares, valued at $2,837 upon closing, in share-based payments to Connor Green. Through the agreements between CGSF and Little Beach Harvest, the Company will provide management services to Little Beach Harvest for the development of the facilities, including planning, design and funding of up to approximately $18,000 in capital expenditures in order to provide a fully vertical cannabis operation. The 9% debt financing the Company provides will be repaid through cash flows monthly and is secured by the assets of the project. In exchange for providing management services, SFNY will receive 11.25% of Shinnecock’s gross revenue as well as 18.75% of free cash flows from all Shinnecock cannabis operations during the initial term of up to nine years. The management agreement may be extended up to ten additional years, pending accomplishment of certain performance-based milestones related to revenue and profitability.
On October 27, 2021, the Company closed the sale of substantially all of the assets of Santé Veritas Therapeutics Inc. (“SVT”), an inactive wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, to Meridian 125W Cultivation Ltd. for approximately C$900 in cash. Part of the proceeds were used to resolve outstanding liabilities.
Competition
The Company’s businesses face competition from companies with varying resources, access to public markets, quality of management, geographic reach and strategic focus.

The Inhalation Technology business competes primarily with distributors of CCELL® vape hardware in the U.S. and Canada. Additionally, the Company competes with CCELL’s direct sales team in the Canadian market. The Company also competes with manufacturers of proprietary cannabis vaporization technologies and views manufacturers of tobacco vaporization technologies as potential future competitors. Product quality, innovation, pricing and availability are important differentiating factors in the vaporization hardware market. The Company believes its commitment to inhalation technology innovation, supply chain management expertise, highly focused sales team and ability to commit balance sheet resources for inventory positioning, among other factors, allows the Company to compete effectively for the wholesale B2B of the Company’s vape and inhalation customers.
The Company’s Cannabis business competes with hundreds of cultivators, manufacturers, distributors and retailers in the Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Ohio markets. These competitors range from small family-owned operations to well-capitalized publicly traded multi-state operators. The Company’s Cannabis business operates in states with regulations limiting the number of cannabis licenses that will be awarded, representing a barrier to entry for potential new market participants. The Company believes its partnerships with strong third-party brand companies seeking a presence in the state markets where it operates allows the Company’s Cannabis business to compete in each market. The Company utilizes its in-house expertise on behalf of its brand partners to receive product approvals, scale up production and sell products with effective promotion, packaging, pricing, placement and inventory availability and then bring these brands to market through its wholesale distribution channel.
As cannabis remains federally illegal in the U.S., businesses seeking to enter the industry face challenges when accessing capital. At present, relatively few sources of debt or equity capital and bank lending are available to fund operations in the U.S. cannabis sector. Nevertheless, the Company is well-capitalized, and management believes that significant capital and expertise is required to replicate the Company’s assets and capabilities, which are focused on providing business solutions to B2B customers building enduring brands in the highly competitive U.S. cannabis market.
Intellectual Property
The Company has developed multiple proprietary product features, technologies and processes to ensure the protection of its innovative and quality products. These proprietary technologies and processes include its cultivation and extraction techniques, product formulations and delivery and monitoring systems. While actively pursuing the patenting of these processes and materials, the Company ensures confidentiality through the use of non-disclosure and/confidentiality agreements.
Jupiter has spent considerable time and resources to establish a premium and recognizable brand amongst consumers and retailers in the cannabis industry. As of December 31, 2022, Jupiter had 14 issued patents and 19 pending U.S. and International patent applications, and seven federally registered trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”). All issued patent and trademarks are further described below. The Company maintains an in-house legal team, as well as engages outside legal counsel, to actively monitor and identify potential infringements on Jupiter’s intellectual property.

Legal and Regulatory Matters
Regulatory Overview
In accordance with Staff Notice 51-352 Issuers with U.S. Marijuana-Related Activities (the “Staff Notice”), below is a discussion of the federal and state-level U.S. regulatory regimes in those jurisdictions where the Company is currently involved through its subsidiaries. The Company or its subsidiaries are, recently were or are expected to be directly engaged in the manufacture, possession, use, sale or distribution of cannabis in the states of Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Ohio. The Company is in compliance with the applicable state regulatory framework and licensing requirements for each of the states of Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Ohio.
The Company also has ancillary involvement in the marijuana industry through the products and services it provides to customers in the following states and U.S. territories: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and West Virginia. The Company is not aware of any non-compliance by its customers with any applicable licensing requirements or regulatory framework enacted by each of these respective states.
In accordance with the Staff Notice, the Company will evaluate, monitor and reassess this disclosure, and any related risks, on an ongoing basis and the same will be supplemented and amended to investors in public filings, including in the event of government policy changes or the introduction of new or amended guidance, laws or regulations regarding marijuana regulation. Any non-compliance, citations or notices of violation which may have an impact on the Company’s licenses, business activities or operations will be promptly disclosed by the Company.
Regulation of Cannabis in the U.S. Federally
The U.S. federal government regulates drugs through the CSA (21 U.S.C. § 811). Pursuant to the CSA, cannabis is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the U.S., lacks safety for use under medical supervision and has a high potential for abuse. The DOJ defines Schedule I drugs, substances or chemicals as “drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.”
The FDA has not approved cannabis as a safe and effective drug for any use.

Canada has federal legislation which uniformly governs the cultivation, processing, distribution, sale and possession of both medical and recreational cannabis under the Cannabis Act, as well as various provincial and territorial regulatory frameworks that further govern the distribution, sale and consumption of recreational cannabis within the applicable province or territory. In contrast, cannabis is only permissively regulated at the state level in the U.S.
State laws in the U.S. regulating cannabis are in direct conflict with the CSA, which prohibits cannabis use and possession. Although certain states and territories of the U.S. authorize medical and/or recreational cannabis cultivation, manufacturing, production, distribution and sales by licensed or registered entities, under U.S. federal law, the cultivation, manufacture, distribution, possession, use, and transfer of cannabis and any related drug paraphernalia, unless specifically exempt, is illegal and any such acts are criminal acts under the CSA. Although the Company’s activities are compliant with applicable U.S. state laws, strict compliance with state laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve the Company of liability under U.S. federal law, nor may it provide a defense to any federal proceeding which may be brought against the Company.
The risk of federal enforcement and other risks associated with the Company’s business are described in Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Legal Advice in Accordance with the Staff Notice
Legal advice has been obtained by the Company regarding applicable U.S. federal and state law.

​
Below is a summary of the licensing and regulatory framework in the markets where, as of December 31, 2022, the Company held licenses and had direct or indirect involvement with the U.S. cannabis industry, followed by outlines of the regulatory framework in each of the relevant states.

Massachusetts
Massachusetts became the eighteenth state to legalize medical marijuana when voters passed a ballot measure in 2012. Adult-use (recreational) marijuana is legal in Massachusetts as of December 15, 2016, following the passage of a ballot initiative in November of that year. The CCC, a regulatory body created in 2016, oversees both the Medical Use of Marijuana Program and the Adult Use of Marijuana Program.

Under the Medical Use of Marijuana Program, a Medical Marijuana Treatment Center (“MTC”) is required to be vertically integrated, such that a single MTC license holder must cultivate, manufacture and dispense medical marijuana and marijuana products to registered, qualifying patients and personal caregivers. Pursuant to the CCC’s regulations, no Person or Entity Having Direct or Indirect Control over the MTC’s operations may be granted or hold more than three MTC Licenses.
Under the Adult Use of Marijuana Program, vertical integration is not required, and therefore multiple types of adult-use Marijuana Establishment (“ME”) licenses exist. The Marijuana Cultivator (Indoor or Outdoor), Marijuana Product Manufacturer and Marijuana Retailer licenses cover the three main operational license types (cultivation, manufacturing and retail sales). ME Licenses, subject to certain ownership requirements, are also available for Independent Testing Laboratories, Marijuana Research Facilities, Marijuana Transporters (Third-Party or Existing Licensee), Craft Marijuana Cooperatives, Marijuana Couriers, Marijuana Delivery Operators, Social Consumption Establishments (once authorized by municipalities and an application is released by the CCC) and Marijuana Microbusinesses. No Person or Entity Having Direct or Indirect Control over the ME’s operations may be granted or hold more than three licenses in a particular class of license, except as otherwise specified in the applicable regulations. In addition, any Person or Entity Having Direct or Indirect Control, or Licensee, is limited to a total of 100,000 square feet of cultivation “canopy” distributed across no more than three adult-use Marijuana Cultivator Licenses and three MTC Licenses.
The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary CAC, holds three operational vertically integrated MTC licenses, with medical dispensary locations in Brockton, Taunton and Cambridge, and medical cultivation and product manufacturing operations in Taunton. CAC has also received final licenses (including authorization to commence operations) for its adult-use retailer operations in Taunton and Brockton, as well as its adult-use cultivator and product manufacturer operations in Taunton. The Company is in compliance with Massachusetts state law and the related licensing framework.
Ohio
On June 8, 2016, former Ohio Governor John Kasich signed House Bill (“HB”) 523 into law, sanctioning the use of marijuana for limited medical purposes and establishing a commercial marijuana regulatory regime. Qualifying conditions for access to medical marijuana under the program include, but are not limited to, chronic and severe pain, post-traumatic stress disorder and cancer. Ohio’s medical cannabis program is regulated by both the Ohio Department of Commerce (“Department of Commerce”) and the Ohio Board of Pharmacy (“Ohio Board”). The Department of Commerce is responsible for licensing cultivators, processors and testing laboratories, while the Ohio Board is responsible for registering patients and caregivers as well as licensing medical marijuana dispensaries. Final regulations governing the program, including applications for business licensure, the operation of commercial medical cannabis establishments, physician certifications and patient registration have been adopted.
Ohio’s medical cannabis program allows businesses to be structured as for-profit entities and does not impose residency requirements for investment or ownership in a commercial cannabis license. Ohio’s licensing structure permits, but does not require, vertical integration. Each license (cultivation, processor and dispensary) is issued on an individual basis for each facility type/function. There are three different types of processors — stand-alone, vertically integrated facilities and a plant-only processor, which is a cultivator who distributes plant material directly to dispensaries. Common ownership between cultivation, processing and dispensing licenses is permitted, but prohibited for cannabis testing licensees. However, no one entity or person may own, have a financial interest in or significantly influence or control the activities of more than one cultivation license, more than one processing license or more than five dispensary licenses at any given time.
In March 2021, the Company completed its acquisition of Standard Farms OH, a licensed stand-alone processor in Ohio. Standard Farms OH engages in the production, possession, use, sale and distribution of cannabis products in Ohio’s medicinal cannabis marketplace. The Company is in compliance with Ohio state law and the related licensing framework.

Pennsylvania
In April 2016, Pennsylvania’s Governor Tom Wolf signed the Commonwealth’s first medical marijuana bill into law. The medical program created a commercial system for a limited number of businesses and permits physicians to recommend cannabis for a limited number of qualifying conditions. The Pennsylvania Department of Health (“PA DOH”) regulates medical marijuana businesses in the Commonwealth and issues two types of primary permits: a medical marijuana grower/processor permit and a medical marijuana dispensary permit. The PA DOH also issues a third type of permit called a clinical registrant permit. The clinical registrant permit is a combination of a grower/processor permit and a dispensary permit that is limited to applicants who have established a partnership with an accredited medical school in Pennsylvania. 
For licensing purposes, the PA DOH split the Commonwealth into six regions. The state initially limited the total number of medical marijuana organizations to twenty-five grower/processors and fifty dispensaries Commonwealth-wide. Each dispensary is permitted to have up to three dispensary sites for a total of 150 potential dispensary locations throughout Pennsylvania. For each dispensary permit, the locations must be within the region where the permit was awarded. For medical marijuana grower/processors, the location is limited to the region where the permit was awarded, but distribution is permissible across all regions. The PA DOH may approve up to ten clinical registrants, with each eligible for only one grower/processor permit and one dispensary permit (each clinical registrant may provide medical marijuana at up to six dispensary locations). Residency is not required to operate a medical marijuana organization in Pennsylvania. Vertical integration is limited, as the PA DOH may not issue more than five grower/processor businesses dispensary permits. In addition, a single entity may not hold more than one grower/processor permit nor more than five dispensary permits.
In June 2021, Governor Wolf signed HB 1024, into law expanding the ability of patients to access medical cannabis and extending certain policies that were temporarily enacted during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Under HB 1024, the maximum number of clinical registrants was expanded from eight to ten. Additionally, dispensaries are allowed to offer cannabis curbside deliveries; patients can obtain a ninety day instead of the previous thirty-day supply for cannabis and the five person cap on the number of patients that a caregiver can serve was removed indefinitely. Patients can also now consult with authorizing physicians via video conferencing. The law also expanded the pool of eligible conditions to include cancer remission therapy and CNS-related neuropathy as well as eliminated provisions that previously required chronic pain patients to try conventional prescription pain medications prior to using cannabis. Additionally, the law makes it easier for grower/processors to process marijuana that failed tests for yeast and mold into products that are topical in form. The law also expands the number of research facilities that are studying patient response to medical marijuana.
In July 2022, Governor Wolf signed HB 311, which provides additional protections under Pennsylvania law for financial institutions and insurers providing services to, or for the benefit of, a “legitimate cannabis-related business.” HB 311 also explicitly states that financial institutions and insurers are not obligated to provide services to cannabis businesses within the Commonwealth. Additionally, HB 311 requires cannabis businesses that are receiving financial or insurance services from a provider within Pennsylvania to disclose any suspension or revocation of cannabis-related permits, registrations, or certifications to the financial institution and/or insurer within five business days.
In October 2022, the PA DOH finalized its medical marijuana regulations. These final regulations mirror the temporary regulations and reflect the PA DOH’s efforts to keep pace with the growth and evolution of the medical marijuana program. The final regulations include the following notable updates: 


• | Expanded packaging and labeling requirements, including that labels must contain the species and percentages of all cannabinoids and individual terpenes.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Clarification that a grower/processor must notify the PA DOH within 48 hours of any anticipated increases or decreases in production.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Revised facility signage requirements.
--+---------------------------------------


• | Revised definition of “medical marijuana waste” to exclude unopened, briefly misdirected medical marijuana products (thereby eliminating the requirement that the grower/processor destroy such misdirected products).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Reduced video surveillance footage storage period from two years to 180 days.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Grower/processors must use separate testing laboratories for harvest and process testing.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Growers/processors must “immediately” investigate complaints and the PA DOH may initiate a mandatory recall upon receipt of information that any medical marijuana product poses a risk to public health and safety.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Owners of securities in a publicly traded corporation or owners of 5% or less in privately held business entities and who do not have voting rights to elect or appoint one or more members of the board of directors or other governing board are exempt from the background check requirement.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Clarification on the procedure for notifying the DOH of changes of ownership.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Clarification on the procedure for applying to the DOH for changes of location of an operational facility.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | New process for changing the location of a non-operational facility.

The Company’s compliance program emphasizes security and inventory control to ensure strict monitoring of cannabis and inventory from delivery by a licensed distributor to sale or disposal. Only authorized and properly trained employees are allowed to access the Company’s computerized seed-to-sale system.
The Company’s CEO or anyone appointed by the CEO monitors all compliance notifications from the regulators and inspectors in each market, timely resolving any issues identified. The Company keeps records of all compliance notifications received from the state regulators or inspectors and how and when the issue was resolved.
Further, the Company has created comprehensive standard operating procedures that include detailed descriptions and instructions for receiving shipments of inventory, inventory tracking, recordkeeping and record retention practices related to inventory, as well as procedures for handling cash, performing inventory and cash reconciliation, ensuring the accuracy of inventory tracking and recordkeeping. The Company maintains accurate records of its inventory at all licensed facilities. Adherence to the Company’s standard operating procedures is mandatory and ensures that the Company’s operations are compliant with the applicable state and local laws, regulations, ordinances, licenses, rules and other requirements. The Company ensures adherence to standard operating procedures by regularly conducting internal inspections and ensures that any issues identified are resolved quickly and thoroughly.
In January 2018, U.S. Attorney General, Jeff Sessions rescinded the Cole Memorandum. The rescission of the Cole Memorandum and other Obama-era prosecutorial guidance did not create a change in federal law, as the Cole Memorandum was never legally binding; however, the revocation removed the DOJ’s guidance to U.S. Attorneys that state-regulated cannabis industries operating substantively in compliance with the Cole Memorandum’s guidelines should not be a prosecutorial priority. As an industry best practice, despite the rescission of the Cole Memorandum, the Company continues to do the following to ensure compliance with the guidance provided by the Cole Memorandum:

• | ensure the operations of its subsidiaries and business partners are compliant with all licensing requirements that are set forth with regards to cannabis operation by the applicable state, county, municipality, town, township, borough, and other political/administrative divisions. To this end, the Company retains appropriately experienced legal counsel to conduct the necessary due diligence to ensure compliance of such operations with all applicable laws and regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the activities relating to cannabis business adhere to the scope of the license obtained — for example, in the states where only medical cannabis is permitted, the products are only sold to patients who hold the necessary documentation to permit the possession of the cannabis; and in the states where cannabis is permitted for adult recreational use, the products are only sold to individuals who meet the requisite age requirements;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Company only works through licensed operators, which must pass a range of requirements, adhere to strict business practice standards and be subjected to strict regulatory oversight whereby sufficient checks and balances ensure that no revenue is distributed to criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Company conducts reviews of products, product packaging and transactions to ensure that the products comply with applicable regulations, contain necessary disclaimers about the contents of the products and provide requisite educational material to mitigate adverse public health consequences from cannabis use and prevent impaired driving.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On November 7, 2018, Jeff Sessions resigned from his position as Attorney General. The next Attorney General, William Barr, stated that he does not intend “go after” parties who are involved in the cannabis business and are compliant with state law in reliance on the Cole Memorandum. Under President Biden’s administration and his appointed Attorney General, Merrick Garland, DOJ rhetoric around cannabis has largely returned to the Obama-era rhetoric even if a new prosecutorial guidance memorandum has not been re-issued. During his Senate confirmation, Merrick Garland told Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) that, “It does not seem to me useful the use of limited resources that we have to be pursuing prosecutions in states that have legalized and are regulating the use of marijuana, either medically or otherwise.” Such statements are not official declarations or policies of the DOJ and are not binding on the DOJ, on any U.S. Attorney or on the U.S. federal courts, and substantial uncertainty regarding U.S. federal enforcement remains.

 To date, there has been no new federal cannabis memorandums issued by the Biden Administration or any published change in federal enforcement policy. Regardless, the federal government of the U.S. has always reserved the right to enforce federal law regarding the sale and disbursement of medical or recreational marijuana, even if state law sanctioned such sale and disbursement. Although the rescission of the Cole Memorandum does not necessarily indicate that marijuana industry prosecutions are now affirmatively a priority for the DOJ, there can be no assurance that the U.S. federal government will not enforce such laws in the future.
In the absence of a uniform federal policy, as had been established by the Cole Memorandum, numerous U.S. Attorneys with state-legal marijuana programs within their jurisdictions have announced enforcement priorities for their respective offices. For instance, Andrew Lelling, former U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts through February 2021, stated that while his office would not immunize any businesses from federal prosecution, he anticipated focusing the office’s marijuana enforcement efforts on: (1) overproduction; (2) targeted sales to minors; and (3) organized crime and interstate transportation of drug proceeds. Other U.S. Attorneys provided less assurance, promising to enforce federal law, including the CSA in appropriate circumstances.
The Company will continue to monitor compliance on an ongoing basis in accordance with its compliance program and standard operating procedures. While the Company’s operations are in full compliance with all applicable state laws, regulations and licensing requirements, such activities remain illegal under U.S. federal law. For the reasons described above and the risks further described in the Risk Factors section below, there are significant risks associated with the business of the Company. Readers are strongly encouraged to carefully read all of the risk factors contained in Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
