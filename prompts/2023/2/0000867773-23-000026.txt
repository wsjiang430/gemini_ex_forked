ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Corporate History
SunPower has been a leader in the solar industry for over 30 years, originally incorporated in California in 1985 and reincorporated in Delaware in 2004 in connection with our initial public offering. In November 2011, our stockholders approved the reclassification of all outstanding former class A common stock and class B common stock into a single class of common stock listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol “SPWR.” In fiscal 2011, we became a majority-owned subsidiary of TotalEnergies Solar INTL SAS (“Total,” formerly Total Solar International SAS) and TotalEnergies Gaz & Electricité Holdings SAS (“Total Gaz,” formerly Total Gaz Electricité Holdings France SAS), each a subsidiary of TotalEnergies SE (“TotalEnergies SE,” formerly Total SE). On September 12, 2022, Total and Total Gaz sold to GIP III Sol Acquisition, LLC (“GIP Sol”) 50% less one unit of the equity interests in a newly formed Delaware limited liability company, Sol Holding, LLC (“HoldCo”), which is now the record holder of the majority of SunPower common stock (see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 3. Transactions with Total and TotalEnergies SE” for more details on the transaction).
Company Overview
SunPower Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “SunPower,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a leading solar technology and energy services provider that offers fully integrated solar, storage, and home energy solutions to customers primarily in the United States and Canada through an array of hardware, software, and financing options and “Smart Energy” solutions.

We are a leader in the U.S. Distributed Generation (“DG”) storage and energy services market, providing customers control over electricity consumption and resiliency during power outages, while providing cost savings to homeowners and also reducing carbon emissions and contributing to a more sustainable grid. The five pillars of our strategy include: 1) Customer Care: provide a world-class customer experience that moves beyond the initial system sale to create a lifetime relationship with SunPower, 2) Products: offer all market segments a growing ecosystem of integrated high-value, high-performance products and services, 3) Growth: optimize a multi-channel strategy of distributed dealer network, geographically diverse SunPower Direct channel, and new home builder partnerships for above-market growth, 4) Digital Innovation: enable operational excellence that supports our dealers, accelerates sales, improves financial products and adds customer control and monitoring of systems for optimum efficiency, and 5) Financial Solutions: expand affordable and easy-to-use customer financing products, reducing the biggest barrier to solar adoption.
On August 26, 2020, we completed the spin-off (the “Spin-Off”) of Maxeon Solar Technologies, Ltd. (“Maxeon Solar”), a Singapore public company limited by shares, consisting of certain non-U.S. operations and assets of our former SunPower Technologies business unit. As a result of the Spin-Off, we no longer consolidate Maxeon Solar within our financial results of continuing operations. For all periods prior to the Spin-Off, the financial results of Maxeon Solar are presented as net earnings from discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of operations.
On October 4, 2021, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) to acquire all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Solar Holdings, LLC (“Blue Raven”), and 35% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Albatross Software LLC (“Albatross”), an affiliate of Blue Raven. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to pay to the sellers up to $145.0 million in initial cash consideration, which amount was subject to a customary working capital adjustment. The Purchase Agreement also provided that the Company would make certain cash payments to Blue Raven executives, employees and service providers, which are included in the aggregate purchase price, in accordance with related agreements entered into between such individuals and Blue Raven. During fiscal 2022, we completed cash payments to Blue Raven executives, employees, and service providers in an amount of $20.0 million, and a holdback amount paid to key employees, which was accelerated after the sale to GIP Sol, of $4.5 million. Our obligations under this acquisition are complete.
Recent Developments
Sale of the C&I Solutions Business
On February 6, 2022, we signed an Equity Purchase Agreement (the “Definitive Agreement”) with TotalEnergies Renewables USA, LLC (“TotalEnergies Renewables”), a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of TotalEnergies SE, for the sale of our Commercial and Industrial Solutions (“C&I Solutions”) business for a preliminary purchase price of $190.0 million, subject to the terms and considerations set forth in the Definitive Agreement. The transaction closed on May 31, 2022, and upon closing, we received net cash consideration of $149.2 million based on the estimated net assets of the business on that date.
For all periods presented, the financial results of C&I Solutions are presented as net earnings from discontinued operations on the consolidated statement of operations, as well as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheets. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 2. Discontinued Operations” for more details on the transaction.
Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”)
On August 16, 2022, the IRA was enacted. The IRA includes, among other things, an expansion and extension of the solar investment tax credit (“ITC”) for eligible solar energy systems through at least 2032. The IRA allows qualifying taxpayers (either individual taxpayers in the case of a residential system sold via cash or loan, or corporate taxpayers in the case of a residential third-party owned system or residential multifamily system) to credit 30% of the fair market value of the solar or solar paired battery storage system from their U.S. federal income taxes starting in 2022, thus returning a significant portion of the fair market value of the solar system to the taxpayer. Beginning in 2023, a new standalone battery storage ITC, also at a value of 30% of the fair market value of the system, is available. Under the terms of the IRA, the solar, solar paired battery storage, and standalone battery storage ITCs will remain at 30% through the end of 2032, reduce to 26% for 2033, reduce to 22% for 2034, and further reduce to 0% or 10% after the end of 2034 (with the percentage dependent on the eligibility of the taxpayer associated with the residential system). The IRA also includes provisions beginning in 2023 that, depending on the location of a particular system and/or its ability to satisfy certain domestic content or low-income customer requirements, allows for substantial increases in the percentage value of the ITC for eligible systems that qualify, including residential single family home third-party owned systems and residential multifamily building systems, beyond the 30% minimum.
Finally, the IRA includes numerous additional provisions regarding extension and expansion of other tax credits or federal incentive programs related to our business, including the renewal and extension of the tax credits applicable to electric vehicle charging equipment. We believe the enactment of the IRA is favorable to our business as it may increase demand for our services due to the extensions and expansions of tax credits, which in turn help reduce the costs of our products and services for our customers. However, the impact of the IRA cannot be known with certainty, as we may not recognize all the expected benefits. We are continuing to evaluate the overall impact and applicability of the IRA to our results of operations going forward.
Segment Information
As a result of the sale of our C&I Solutions business, we now operate in a single operating segment, providing solar power systems and services to residential customers. While our chief executive officer, as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), reviews financial information by different functions and revenue streams, he considers the business on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and reviewing overall business performance.
Our COVID-19 Response
We continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic, and the health and safety of our employees and contractors is a top priority. In an effort to protect our employees and contractors, we continue to review and comply with all health and safety regulations and public health guidance, as well as updating our protocols as necessary. We may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers.
Outlook 
We believe the execution of our strategy will provide attractive opportunities for profitable growth over the long term. With the acquisition of Blue Raven, we expanded our geographic footprint, particularly outside of California, in the U.S. residential solar and battery storage space, to address the growing demand for residential solar and battery storage across the country, such as the under-penetrated areas in Northwest, Midwest and Atlantic regions. Further, on May 31, 2022, we completed the sale of our C&I Solutions business to TotalEnergies Renewables, as part of our growing focus on and investment in our residential solar and battery storage business. We strongly believe that the time is now for residential consumers to adopt solar energy and battery storage, with flexible financing options and favorable clean energy incentives, via the federal IRA and at the state and local level that make it easier for consumers to achieve electricity bill savings and resiliency, while helping to fight against the increasing impact of climate change. We believe the most significant elements of uncertainty in executing on our strategy are the impact of ongoing global supply chain constraints on component and services costs and consumer spending, as well as the ability of our sales channels, supply chain, and distribution centers to operate with minimal disruption in the near term. In addition, the new net energy metering program (“NEM 3.0”) in California may result in some market disruption that in turn may impact our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and outlook. As the NEM 3.0 program will go into effect on April 15, 2023, we expect an increased level of demand, particularly for solar systems for new and current customers seeking to expand their existing solar system, through the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The typical solar customer under the NEM 3.0 program will see less utility bill savings in comparison to the current program, NEM 2.0, therefore, solar demand after April 15, 2023 is unknown. However, with NEM 3.0, the addition of battery storage can increase utility bill savings for the typical customer substantially more than with solar only. This illustrates the importance of storage to the solar proposition for California homeowners, and we will pivot our marketing and sales strategy accordingly. 
Solutions 
With our investment in our residential solar business, we offer solutions to existing residential and new homes markets, and our all-in-one solutions include a full suite of renewable energy systems: solar, storage, EV chargers, software, and services. As part of our solutions-based approach, we focus on our SunPower Equinox and SunVault products for our residential customers. The Equinox and SunVault products systems are pre-engineered modular solutions for residential applications that combine our high-efficiency solar module technology with integrated plug-and-play power stations, cable management systems, and mounting hardware that enable our dealers and installers to quickly and easily complete system installations and for our end customers to manage their energy production. Our Equinox systems utilize both high efficiency premium interdigitated back contact (“IBC”) cell technology panels and lower cost mono passivated emitter and rear contact (“PERC”) panels coupled with alternating-current microinverters for residential applications, where we are also working to expand our initiatives on storage and smart energy solutions. Additionally, we continue to expand our offerings of high-quality products for the mainstream market with our U-Series product line, which we believe will enhance our ability to rapidly expand our footprint with minimal capital cost. 
We continue to see a significant and increasing number of opportunities in technologies and capabilities adjacent to our core product offerings that we believe can significantly reduce our Customer Cost of Energy (“CCOE”) and expand the lifetime value of a customer, including the integration of energy storage and energy management functionality into our systems, and have made investments to realize those opportunities, enabling our customers to make intelligent energy choices by addressing how they buy and use energy. We offer solar panels that use micro-inverters designed to eliminate the need to mount or assemble additional components on the roof or the side of a building and enable optimization and monitoring at the solar panel level to ensure maximum energy production by the solar system. In addition, our acquisition of Blue Raven in fiscal 2021 expanded our offerings and increased our opportunities to deliver solar power generation solutions to our customers, with an expanded footprint into new territories of the United States as well. 
OneRoof®
Our latest roofing system, OneRoof®, is a Class A fire-rated, UL-certified roofing system that replaces concrete roofing tiles for a fully integrated roof-plus-solar solution. With flexible design configurations, integrated panel clips, and built-in grounding, installation is simple and designed specifically for new homes. With direct-to-deck attachments, self-aligning modules, and snap-in-place module attachments, OneRoof installs two to three times faster than conventional mounting, and is cost efficient by replacing roof materials. Kynar-coated metal components add a rugged layer of roof protection that lasts longer than typical composite shingles and are covered by our Complete Confidence Warranty. Our Complete Confidence Warranty covers products, parts, and service for 25 years, monitoring hardware for 10 years, and the Kynar-coated-steel finish for 5 years. OneRoof sits seamlessly with the rest of the roof for a sleek, low-profile look with virtually no visible parts. Interlocking flashings and pans with individually sealed screws create a watertight barrier against harsh conditions, including wind-driven rain, and is built to last. OneRoof is the only complete roof-integrated solar system, paired with the world’s best solar.
SunVault™ Storage 
Our SunVault™ storage solution is primarily designed for residential customers and its two-box solution fits in indoor or outdoor areas. Homeowners get reliable backup power during an outage and the system provides the flexibility to manage energy as they deem fit. SunVault storage integrates with SunPower solar systems, creating a holistic home solar plus storage solution designed, installed, and warranted by one company. Its intelligent software shifts when drawing power from the grid, maximizing the use of solar, as well as provides real-time updates as to home energy use, solar and storage usage, through customized settings. With less than 0.5% of homes in the United States having storage, and power outages continuing to rise, our storage solutions provide an attractive way to use solar. We expect to release additional updates to our SunVault solution nationwide within the next fiscal year. The updated solution will extend the offering to new segments of the market that are currently not serviced, which will significantly enhance our total serviceable market.
In addition, our Virtual Power Plant (“VPP”), launched during fiscal 2021, enables SunVault energy storage customers to get paid for sharing stored solar energy with utilities during peak demand and contribute to a more stable power grid in their community. VPPs enable utilities to request energy from efficient, renewable energy resources like distributed solar and energy storage and disperse it among all grid-connected customers to create a more stable and sustainable source of power. The coordination of the charge and discharge of a participating customer’s battery and sharing of the energy to the utility is performed by SunPower on the customer’s behalf. SunPower also allows customers to reserve a portion of their stored energy for emergency use, even as they participate in a VPP. Customers participating in the VPP will be notified prior to discharging of the battery and can set their battery threshold levels through customized settings, and in turn are compensated by the utility for their participation.
Flexible Financing Options 
We have a long track record of attracting low-cost capital from diverse sources, including tax equity and debt investors. Since inception, we have raised tax equity investment funds to finance the installation of solar energy systems. 
Advances in financing are playing a big part in driving increased profits and dealer loyalty. We sell our residential solar energy solutions to end customers through a variety of means, including cash and financed systems sales directly to end customers and sales to resellers, including our third-party dealer network. 
During fiscal 2021, we launched an in-house finance company, SunPower FinancialTM which offers a complete range of financing products and an increased set of financing options for our customers. Through SunPower Financial, we offer financing programs that are designed to provide customers with a variety of options to obtain high-efficiency solar products and systems, including loans arranged through our third-party lending partners, in some cases for no money down, or leases at competitive energy rates. SunPower Financial was designed to make renewable energy affordable for more homeowners and increase access to underserved populations by supporting a new line of financial products featuring expanded eligibility. The launch of SunPower Financial supported our commitment to increase access to solar energy for residential customers who live in historically underserved communities by 25% by 2025, in accordance with our 25x25 diversity, equity and inclusion (“DE&I”) initiative we launched in fiscal 2021.
Additionally, since the launch of SunPower Financial, our customers now have broader choices for purchasing, as well as affordable financing of, solar power systems from us. Further, since its launch in 2011, our residential lease program, in partnership with third-party investors, typically provides U.S. customers SunPower systems under 20-year lease agreements that include system maintenance and warranty coverage, including warranties on system performance. SunPower residential lease customers have the option to purchase their leased solar systems upon the sale or transfer of their home. These financing options enhance our ability to provide individually tailored solar solutions to a broad range of residential customers and expand our lifetime value for a customer. 
Supply 
The majority of the solar panels used in our residential system solutions are sourced from Maxeon Solar under the terms of our master supply agreement, dated as of February 14, 2022 and amended on December 31, 2022, which replaces the supply agreement we entered into with Maxeon Solar in connection with the Spin-Off. During fiscal 2022, we also began sourcing various modules and components for our residential systems from Waaree Energies Ltd. and Hanwha Qcells through a series of purchase agreements. In addition, we entered into a new supply agreement with Maxeon Solar dated as of December 31, 2022, for the purchase of certain designated residential solar products, including high efficiency premium IBC solar panels, during fiscal 2024 and 2025. We have secured supply of domestically assembled panels, through our agreements with Hanwha Qcells which are being manufactured in Dalton, Georgia. Thus, we have the potential to benefit from the IRA through incentives for corporations to utilize domestic content in third-party owned systems.
We work with our suppliers and partners to ensure the reliability of our supply chain. We are continuing to diversify our supply base by forging new supplier relationships for single-sourced parts to support supply continuity and new products. We have also contracted with certain suppliers for multi-year supply agreements, under which we have annual minimum purchase obligations. In addition, we have begun new partnerships with minority-owned business organizations through our 25x25 DE&I initiative, where we are committed to ensuring industry equity and increasing our supplier diversity. For more information about our purchase commitments and obligations, see “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Contractual Obligations” and “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies.” 
Technology
Energy Management Services
“Energy Management Services” is a path to harness our world’s energy potential by connecting the most powerful and reliable solar systems, batteries and electric vehicles on the market with an increasingly vast array of actionable data that help customers make smarter decisions about their energy use. Our ‘Energy Management Services’ initiative is designed to add intelligent control to any permutation of residential distributed energy resources our customers choose to procure, and to enhance the overall customer experience of owning a SunPower system. In order to enable and enhance the portfolio of Smart Energy Management Services solutions we offer, we plan to continue to invest in integrated technology solutions that allow customers to both manage and optimize their CCOE. These investments include, but are not limited to, rate arbitrage and targeted self-consumption to generate maximum bill savings in the most complex utility tariff frameworks and connecting customer systems to VPP and other grid services opportunities. We believe that investing in these areas will continue to pay dividends as markets mature and renewable deployments accelerate outside California. 
Inverters
Every solar power system needs an inverter to transform the direct current electricity collected from the solar panels into utility-grade alternating current (“AC”) power that is ready for use. We sell inverters manufactured by third parties, some of which are SunPower-branded for residential customers. Subsequent to the sale of our microinverter business in August 2018, we procure microinverters for both field installation and the manufacture and distribution of AC modules for the U.S. residential market from Enphase Energy, Inc. (“Enphase”). Panels coupled with these microinverters perform better in shaded applications compared to conventional string inverters and allow for optimization and monitoring at the solar panel level, enabling maximum energy production by the solar system.
Warranties
SunPower provides a workmanship warranty ranging from 5 to 25 years from installation, and a 25-year standard warranty for previously SunPower-manufactured microinverters. We also warrant our installed systems for defective materials and workmanship for the warranty term, as well as provide a separate system output performance warranty to customers that have subscribed to our post-installation monitoring and maintenance services. We pass through to customers warranties from the original equipment manufacturers of certain system components such as solar panels, monitoring equipment and inverters. For such components, our warranties may exceed the warranty coverage from the original equipment manufacturers. For solar energy systems we do not install directly, we receive workmanship warranties from our solar partners.
Customers
Our scope and scale allow us to deliver solar and battery storage solutions for residential customers, including individual homeowners and new home builders. We operate in 49 U.S. states, as well as Canada, and leverage a combination of direct sales and a broad partner ecosystem to efficiently reach our customer base.
Our internal sales team, SunPower Direct, including a dedicated new homes division, and our third-party dealer network of more than 700 local dealers have deployed hundreds of thousands of SunPower rooftop solar systems to residential customers. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Revenue” for our significant customers. 
Competition
The market for solar power is competitive and continually evolving. We continue to face increased competition from inflation-driven price increases and supply shortages, which could lead to loss of sales or market share. Our solar power products and systems compete with many competitors in the solar power market, including, but not limited to:
•SunRun, Inc., Sunnova Energy International Inc., Tesla, Inc., SolarEdge, Complete Solaria Inc., Amicus Solar, GAF Energy, ADT Solar, REC Group, Generac Holdings Inc., Maxeon Solar Technologies, Ltd., Enphase Energy, Inc., and Sunlight Financial Holdings Inc.
The residential solar energy market in general competes with other energy providers including electricity produced from conventional fossil fuels or large-scale renewable energy sources supplied by utilities. We also face competition from resellers that have developed related offerings that compete with our products and services, or have entered into strategic relationships with other existing solar power system providers. During fiscal 2022, we launched our Dealer Accelerator Program where we made minority investments in solar dealers to advance their growth in coordination with the rapid growth of their direct business, as well as increase our own strategic relationships. We also compete for limited government funding for research and development contracts, customer tax rebates and other programs that promote the use of solar, and other renewable forms of energy with other renewable energy providers and customers.
We believe the key competitive factors in the market for solar energy management solutions, including systems, storage, and software, are:
•total system quality;
•customer experience;
•warranty protection, quality, and customer service;
•Levelized Cost of Energy (“LCOE”) evaluation;
•CCOE evaluation;
•power, efficiency, and performance under realistic operating conditions;
•aesthetic appearance of solar panels and systems;
•total system price;
•established sales channels to customers;
•bankability, strength, and reputation of our Company;
•wind, snow, and structural load capability;
•speed and ease of installation through modular solutions; 
•dealer and installer training and operational excellence;
•strength of distribution relationships;
•high-productivity sales and commissioning software tools for dealers;
•leveraging extensive fleet data for reliability;
•availability of efficient third-party or in-house financing;
•ITC and federal regulation;
•third-party loan providers and interest rates; and
•offer complete integrated solutions.
We believe that we can compete favorably with respect to each of these elements, particularly with regard to system quality, customer experience and strength of distribution relationships. We may be at a disadvantage in comparison to some companies with total system price and broader product lines. For more information on risks related to our competition, please see the risk factors set forth under the caption “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including “Risks Related to Our Sales Channels—If we and our partners fail to successfully execute our research and development plans and cost reduction roadmap, or fail to develop and introduce new and enhanced products and services, we may be unable to compete effectively, and our ability to generate revenues, cash flows, and profits would suffer.”
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark, and contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights. “SunPower” and the “SunPower” logo are our registered trademarks in the United States for use with solar cells, solar panels, energy monitoring systems, inverters, and mounting systems. We also hold registered trademarks for, among others, “SunPower Equinox,” “SunPower Giving,” “SunPower Horizons,” “Bottle the Sun,” “Demand Better Solar,” “EDDiE,” “EnergyLink,” “Equinox,” “Experiential Learning. Expanding Opportunities.,” “InvisiMount,” “Light on Land,” “Smarter Solar,” “Sol,” “SunTile,” “SunVault,” “OneRoof,” “The Future of Energy. Today,” “Blue Raven Solar,” and “The Power of One” in certain countries. We are seeking and will continue to seek registration of the “SunPower” trademark and other trademarks in additional countries as we believe is appropriate. As of January 1, 2023, we held registrations for 35 trademarks in the United States, and had 8 trademark registration applications pending. We also held 20 trademark registrations and had zero trademark applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. We typically require our business partners to enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our solar cells, technology, or business plans. We typically enter into proprietary information agreements with employees, consultants, vendors, customers, and joint venture partners.
We own multiple patents and patent applications that cover aspects of the technology in the solar panels, mounting products, energy storage, software, and electrical and electronic systems that we sell. We continue to file for and receive new patent rights on a regular basis. The lifetime of a utility patent typically extends for 20 years from the date of filing with the relevant government authority. We assess appropriate opportunities for patent protection of those aspects of our technology, designs, methodologies, and processes that we believe provide significant competitive advantages to us, and for licensing opportunities of new technologies relevant to our business. As of January 1, 2023, we held 238 patents in the United States (439 licensed to Maxeon Solar or its affiliates), which will expire at various times through 2046, and had 54 U.S. patent applications pending (67 licensed to Maxeon Solar or its affiliates). We also had 202 patents and had 33 patent applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. While patents are an important element of our intellectual property strategy, our business as a whole is not dependent on any one patent or any single pending patent application. We additionally rely on trade secret rights to protect proprietary information and know-how. We therefore typically require employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality agreements to protect them.
When appropriate, we enforce our intellectual property rights against other parties. For more information about risks related to our intellectual property, please see the risk factors set forth under the caption “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including “Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—We depend on our intellectual property, and we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be time-consuming and costly to defend and could result in the loss of significant rights,” “Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—We rely substantially upon trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights, and, if these rights are not sufficiently protected, our ability to compete and generate revenue could suffer,” and “Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—We may not obtain sufficient patent protection on the technology embodied in the solar and other products we currently manufacture and market, which could harm our competitive position and increase our expenses.”
Regulations
Public Policy Considerations
Different public policy mechanisms have been used by governments to accelerate the adoption and use of solar power and energy storage. Examples of customer-focused financial mechanisms include capital cost rebates, performance-based incentives, feed-in tariffs, tax credits, and net energy metering. Some of these government mandates and economic incentives are scheduled to be reduced or to expire, or could be eliminated altogether, while others are scheduled to be extended or expanded. Capital cost rebates provide funds to customers based on the cost and size of a customer’s solar power or energy storage system. Performance-based incentives provide funding to a customer based on the energy produced by their solar power system or stored by their energy storage system. Feed-in tariffs pay customers for solar power system generation based on energy produced, at a rate generally guaranteed for a period of time. Tax credits reduce a customer’s taxes at the time the taxes are due. Net energy metering or net energy billing allows customers to deliver to the electric grid any excess electricity produced by their on-site solar power systems, and for those customers to be fairly credited for that excess electricity.
In addition to the mechanisms described above, new market development mechanisms to encourage the use of renewable energy sources continue to emerge. For example, many states in the United States have adopted (and subsequently expanded) renewable portfolio standards which mandate that a certain portion of electricity delivered to customers come from eligible renewable energy resources. Some states additionally mandate that a certain portion of that eligible renewable energy must be distributed generation. Many states have also adopted community solar programs and energy storage mandates. Further, changes in federal and state policies including introduction of new legislation may pose incremental risks or provide opportunities for the Company’s business that may impact our future operations and financial condition. For more information about how we avail ourselves of the benefits of public policies and the risks related to public policies, please see the risk factors set forth under the caption “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including “Risks Related to Our Sales Channels—The reduction, modification, or elimination of government incentives could cause our revenue to decline and harm our financial results,” “Risks Related to Our Sales Channels—Existing regulations and policies and changes to these regulations and policies may present technical, regulatory, and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar power products, which may significantly reduce demand for our products and services,” and “Risks Related to Our Sales Channels—Changes in international trade policies, tariffs, or trade disputes could significantly and adversely affect our business, revenues, margins, results of operations, and cash flows.”
Environmental, Social, Governance (“ESG”)
U.S. and international regulators, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) matters. New domestic and international laws and regulations relating to ESG matters, including human capital, diversity, sustainability, and climate change are under consideration, which may include specific, target-driven disclosure requirements or obligations. Our response will require additional processes and implementation of new practices and reporting all entailing additional compliance risk. The rules and regulations related to ESG are constantly evolving and changing, however, we do not expect any amendments to have a material effect on our operations and financial position.
We use, generate, and discharge materials which may be classified as toxic, volatile, or otherwise hazardous chemicals and wastes which have resulted from our research and development activities. We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations related to the purchase, storage, use, and disposal of hazardous materials. We believe that we have all environmental permits necessary to conduct our business and expect to obtain all necessary environmental permits for future activities. We believe that we have properly handled our hazardous materials and wastes and have appropriately remediated any contamination at any of our premises. We are currently not subject to any litigation pertaining to environment regulations and cost of compliance with applicable regulations is expected to be commensurate with our historical spend and other companies in the industry.
In addition to our existing environmental compliance initiatives, we have engaged additional resources to provide comprehensive oversight and reporting of the ESG components across our processes and business units. We published our fiscal 2021 Environmental, Social, and Governance Report (“2021 ESG Report”) in June 2022, as a continuation of our commitment to sustainability. This report describes the Company’s sustainability and innovation strategies and addresses other environmental and social governance matters such as waste minimization and recycling, minimization of impact on natural resources, and progress we have made in our pledge under our 25X25 DE&I initiative. The 2021 ESG Report can be found on our website at https://us.sunpower.com/why-sunpower/sustainability. This website reference is provided for convenience only and the content on the referenced website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We plan to publish our 2022 ESG Report in the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2023.

Exploration & Production
The Tehran branch office of Total E&P South Pars S.A.S., a wholly-owned subsidiary of TotalEnergies SE, which opened in 2017 for the purposes of the development and production of phase 11 of the South Pars gas field, ceased all operational activities prior to November 1, 2018. In addition, since November 2018, TotalEnergies EP Iran BV maintains a local representative office in Tehran with four employees solely for non-operational functions.
Concerning payments made to Iranian entities in 2022, TotalEnergies EP Iran BV and Elf Petroleum Iran collectively made payments of approximately IRR 3.35 billion (€100,5391) to the Iranian administration for taxes and social security contributions concerning the staff of this representative office. None of these payments were executed in US dollars.

Since November 30, 2018, TotalEnergies E&P UK Limited (“TEP UK”), a wholly owned subsidiary, holds a 1% interest in a joint-venture relating to the Bruce field in the United Kingdom (the “Bruce Field Joint-Venture”) with Serica Energy (UK) Limited (“Serica”) (98%, operator) and BP Exploration Operating Company Limited (“BPEOC”) (1%), following the completion of the sale of 42.25% of TEP UK’s interest in the Bruce Field Joint-Venture on November 30, 2018 pursuant to a sale and purchase agreement dated August 2, 2018 entered into between TEP UK and Serica.
The Bruce Field Joint-Venture is party to an agreement governing certain transportation, processing and operation services provided to another joint-venture at the Rhum field in the UK (the “Bruce Rhum Agreement”). The licensees of the Rhum field are Serica (50%, operator) and the Iranian Oil Company UK Ltd (“IOC UK”), a subsidiary of NIOC (50%), an Iranian government-owned corporation. Under the terms of the Bruce Rhum Agreement, the Rhum field owners pay a proportion of the operating costs of the Bruce field facilities calculated on a gas throughput basis.
In November 2018, the US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (“OFAC”) granted a conditional license to BPEOC and Serica authorizing provision of services to the Rhum field following the re-imposition of US secondary sanctions. The principal condition of the license is that the ownership of shares in IOC UK by Naftiran Intertrade Company Limited (the trading branch of the NIOC) are transferred into and held in a Jersey-based trust, thereby ensuring that the Iranian government does not derive any economic benefit from the Rhum field so long as US sanctions against these entities remain in place. IOC UK’s interest is managed by an independent management company established by the trust and referred to as the “Rhum Management Company” (“RMC”). If necessary, TEP UK liaises with RMC in relation to the Bruce Rhum Agreement and TEP UK expects to continue liaising with RMC on the same basis in 2023.
In January 2021, OFAC renewed the conditional license to Serica authorizing the provision of services to the Rhum field, until January 31, 2023, subject to early termination if the trust arrangements described above should terminate. In addition, OFAC confirmed that, to the extent that the license remains valid and Serica represents that the conditions set out in the license are met, activities and transactions of non-US persons involving the Rhum field or the Bruce field, including in relation to the operation of the trust, IOC UK and RMC will not be exposed to US secondary sanctions with respect to Iran. Following an application filed with the FOCA on November 9, 2022, Serica received in January 2023 the renewal of its license until January 31, 2025.
IOC UK’s share of costs incurred under the Bruce Rhum Agreement has been paid to TEP UK in 2022 by RMC. In 2022, based upon TEP UK’s 1% interest in the Bruce Field Joint Venture and income from the net cash flow sharing arrangement with Serica, gross revenue to TEP UK from IOC UK’s share of the Rhum field resulting from the Bruce Rhum Agreement was approximately £1.9 million. This amount was used to offset operating costs on the Bruce field and as such, generated no net profit to TEP UK. TEP UK expects to continue this activity in 2023.
TEP UK is also party to an agreement with Serica whereby TEP UK uses reasonable endeavors to evacuate Rhum NGL from the St Fergus Terminal (the “Rhum NGL Agreement”). TEP UK provides this service subject to Serica having title to all of the Rhum NGL to be evacuated and Serica having a valid license from OFAC for the activity. The service is provided on a cost basis, and TEP UK charges a monthly handling fee that generates an income of approximately £39,500 per annum relating to IOC UK’s 50% interest in the Rhum field. After costs, TEP UK generates little profit from this arrangement. TEP UK expects to continue this activity in 2023.

Marketing & Services
In 2022, TotalEnergies Marketing France, a wholly owned subsidiary, provided fuel payment cards to be used in TotalEnergies' service stations to the Iranian Embassy and the Iranian delegation to UNESCO located in Paris (France). This activity generated a gross turnover of approximately €20,500 (without tax) and a net profit of approximately €427 in 2022. TotalEnergies Marketing France expects to continue this activity in 2023.
In 2022, TotalEnergies Marketing Belgium, a wholly owned subsidiary, provided fuel payment cards to be used in TotalEnergies' service stations to the Iranian Embassy located in Brussels (Belgium). This activity generated a gross turnover of approximately €17,104 (without tax) and a net profit of approximately €1,770 in 2022. TotalEnergies Marketing Belgium expects to continue this activity in 2023.
Patents & Trademarks
In 2022, TotalEnergies made small payments to Iranian authorities related to the maintenance and protection of trademarks and designs in Iran and may make similar small payments in 2023. These payments are not prohibited by applicable Sanctions Regimes.
Seasonal Trends and Economic Incentives
Our business is subject to industry-specific seasonal fluctuations including changes in weather patterns and economic incentives, such as changes to the amount and timing of the ITC, among others. Sales have historically reflected these seasonal trends with the largest percentage of total revenues realized during the last two quarters of our fiscal year. The construction of solar power systems or installation of solar power components and related revenue may decline during cold and/or rainy winter months. In the United States, many customers make purchasing decisions during peak high heat seasons (summer) or towards the end of the year in order to take advantage of tax credits or for other budgetary reasons. In addition, revenues may fluctuate due to the timing of project sales, construction schedules, and revenue recognition of certain projects, which may significantly impact our quarterly results of operations.

How SunPower develops, attracts, and retains personnel
With our mission To Change the Way Our World is Powered, we work to attract top talent to join the SunPower team. Given the technical nature of our business, our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain skilled employees through a focus on university recruiting, experienced mid-career talent, and working with technical trade partners. We are dedicated to creating a diverse, inclusive, and safe work environment where each person can deliver their best every day. We believe our work environment fosters a rich, equitable culture that allows us to make an impact on our world. We launched our 25x25 DE&I initiative in fiscal 2021, designed to ensure benefits of home solar and storage serve American families, job seekers and businesses that have been historically underserved. We value a culture of respect and dignity and celebrate the differences of our employees.
SunPower employees are responsible for understanding our vision and values, and how their actions support the achievement of our vision on a daily basis. We drive high levels of performance and improvement on an on-going basis through our long-standing tradition of management by objectives and SMART goals, with a clear link back to our core values: Put Safety First, Deliver Superior Experiences, Accountability, Do The Right Thing, Innovate Relentlessly, and Be Fast and Nimble. Our employees generally receive feedback and coaching from their managers on at least a semi-annual basis, ensuring ongoing development. Through bespoke learning and development opportunities, we ensure our employees have the opportunity to achieve their career goals within SunPower.
Attraction and retention of key employees contributes to our ability to remain competitive, and we have a comprehensive total rewards system to help ensure we are compensating and rewarding our employees in line with market practice, providing a competitive benefits programs, and providing flexibility through programs like our Volunteer Time Off initiative. Our ongoing support of our employees' financial, health and wellness needs will continue to be essential. Our pay-for-performance philosophy helps align employee interests with those of our stockholders by rewarding achievements that meet or exceed corporate goals, and grants of stock-based awards under our 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan are intended to align compensation with the price performance of our common stock.
The importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion
SunPower is an equal opportunity employer, and we are committed to maintaining a diverse and inclusive work environment and creating a strong culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion, strengthened by the launch of our 25x25 DE&I initiative. 
Our differences make us stronger. We are diverse in race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, faith, veteran status, ability, and much more. We celebrate these differences. The way we identify ourselves also extends beyond these foundations to diversity of thought and perspective, a range of approaches to problem-solving, and different life experiences. The value we place on diversity is reflected in the way we treat each other and our communities.
Together we are powerful. The power of inclusion is in valuing everyone and their unique contribution. It is important for all our employees to be respected, welcomed, and feel that they are part of something bigger. A culture of inclusion leads to more innovation, healthier working relationships, better decision-making, more fulfilled employees, a better ability to serve our customers, and ultimately a company that does well by doing good. 
We lead with intention. SunPower values diversity of all kinds, and our people and leadership are encouraged to foster inclusion. Our leaders are expected to lead by example. This starts with building awareness on the part of every SunPower employee and holding ourselves accountable. We are committed to never stop listening, learning, and improving.
