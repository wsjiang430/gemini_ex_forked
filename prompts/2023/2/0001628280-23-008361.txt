Our Business
Company Background and History
Alpine 4 Holdings, Inc (“we”, “our”, “Alpine 4”, the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 22, 2014. We are a publicly traded conglomerate that is acquiring businesses that fit into our disruptive DSF business model of Drivers, Stabilizers, and Facilitators. At Alpine 4, we understand the nature of how technology and innovation can accentuate a business. Our focus is on how the adaptation of new technologies even in brick and mortar businesses can drive innovation. We also believe that our holdings should benefit synergistically from each other and that the ability to have collaboration across varying industries can spawn new ideas and create fertile ground for competitive advantages. This unique perspective has culminated in the development of our Blockchain-enabled Enterprise Business Operating System called SPECTRUMebos.
As of the date of this Report, the Company was a holding company that owned fourteen operating subsidiaries:
–A4 Corporate Services, LLC;
–ALTIA, LLC;
–Quality Circuit Assembly, Inc.;
–Morris Sheet Metal, Corp;
–JTD Spiral, Inc.;
–Excel Construction Services, LLC;
–SPECTRUMebos, Inc.;
–Vayu (US), Inc.;
–Thermal Dynamics International, Inc.;
–Alternative Laboratories, LLC.;
–Identified Technologies, Corp;
–ElecJet, Corp.;
–DTI Services Limited Liability Company (doing business as RCA Commercial Electronics); and 
–Global Autonomous Corporation.
Starting in the first quarter of 2020, we also created additional subsidiaries to act as silo holding companies, organized by industries. These silo subsidiaries are A4 Construction Services, Inc. (“A4 Construction”), A4 Manufacturing, Inc. (“A4 Manufacturing”), and A4 Technologies, Inc. (“A4 Technologies”), A4 Aerospace Corporation (“A4 Aerospace”), and A4 Defense Services, Inc. (“A4 Defense Services”). All of these holding companies are Delaware corporations. Each is authorized to issue 1,500 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.01 per share, and the Company is the sole shareholder of each of these subsidiaries. 
In March 2021, the Company announced the combination of its subsidiaries Deluxe Sheet Metal, Inc. (Deluxe) and Morris Sheet Metal Corporation (Morris) to become one of the largest sheet metal contractors in the Midwest region of the United States. Both companies will be under the Morris Sheet Metal brand. The Company’s management believes that the 
combination of these businesses will create a more harmonious relationship between the two companies. The combining of resources should empower Morris to strengthen its brand through its strategic banking relationship, eliminate duplicative and competitive interests, and expand its footprint beyond the Indiana home base.
On May 5, 2021, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of stock of Thermal Dynamics International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Thermal Dynamics”).
On May 10, 2021, the Company acquired all of the outstanding membership interests of KAI Enterprises, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, the sole asset of which was all of the outstanding membership interests of Alternative Laboratories, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Alt Labs”).
In June 2021, the Company announced the combination of its subsidiaries Impossible Aerospace (“IA”) and Vayu (US) (“Vayu US”) to become Vayu Aerospace Corporation (“VAYU”). The Company’s management believes that the combination of these businesses will create a more harmonious relationship between the two companies. The combining of resources should empower VAYU to strengthen its brand through its strategic banking relationship, eliminate duplicative and competitive interests, and expand its footprint beyond the Michigan home base.
On October 20, 2021, the Company, and the Company’s subsidiary, A4 Aerospace, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“A4 Aerospace”), entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Identified Technologies Corporation, a Delaware corporation with foreign registration in Pennsylvania (“Identified Technologies”). Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, A4 Aerospace purchased all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Identified Technologies, a total of 6,486,044 shares of Identified Technologies’ capital stock (the “ITC Shares”). The total purchase price for the ITC Shares was $4,000,000 and was paid in shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, issued to the Shareholders. Following the closing of the transaction, A4 Aerospace owned 100% of the capital stock of Identified Technologies. 
On November 29, 2021, the Company, and a newly formed and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company named ALPP Acquisition Corporation 3, Inc. a Delaware corporation (“AC3”), entered into a merger agreement with ElecJet Corp., a Delaware corporation (“ElecJet”) and the three ElecJet shareholders. Pursuant to the Agreement, AC3 merged with and into ElecJet. AC3 was created solely for the purpose of the merger with ElecJet, and ElecJet was the surviving entity following the merger.

Who We Are
Alexander Hamilton in his “Federalist paper #11”, said that our adventurous spirit distinguishes the commercial character of America.  Hamilton knew that our freedom to be creative gave American businesses a competitive advantage over the rest of the world.   We believe that Alpine 4 also exemplifies this spirit in our subsidiaries and that our greatest competitive advantage is our highly diverse business structure combined with a culture of collaboration.
It is our mandate to grow Alpine 4 into a leading, multi-faceted holding company with diverse subsidiary holdings with products and services that not only benefit from one another as a whole, but also have the benefit of independence. This type of corporate structure is about having our subsidiaries prosper through strong onsite leadership while working synergistically with other Alpine 4 holdings.  The essence of our business model is based around acquiring B2B companies in a broad spectrum of industries via our acquisition strategy of DSF (Drivers, Stabilizer, Facilitator).  Our DSF business model (which is discussed further below) offers our shareholders an opportunity to own small-cap businesses that hold defensible positions in their individual market space.  Further, Alpine 4’s greatest opportunity for growth exists in the smaller to middle-market operating companies with revenues between $5 to $150 million annually. In this target-rich environment, businesses generally sell at more reasonable multiples, presenting greater opportunities for operational and strategic improvements that have greater potential to enhance profit.
Driver, Stabilizer, Facilitator (DSF)
Driver: A Driver is a company that is in an emerging market or technology, that has enormous upside potential for revenue and profits, with a significant market opportunity to access. These types of acquisitions are typically small, brand new companies that need a structure to support their growth. 
Stabilizer: Stabilizers are companies that have sticky customers, consistent revenue and provide solid net profit returns to Alpine 4. 
Facilitators: Facilitators are our “secret sauce”. Facilitators are companies that provide a product or service that an Alpine 4 sister company can use as leverage to create a competitive advantage.
When you blend these categories into a longer-term view of the business landscape, you can then begin to see the value-driving force that makes this a truly purposeful and powerful business model.  As stated earlier, our greatest competitive advantage is our highly diversified business structure combined with a collaborative business culture, that helps drive out competition in our markets by bringing; resources, planning, technology and capacity that our competitors simply don’t have.  DSF reshapes the environment each subsidiary operates in by sharing and exploiting the resources each company has, thus giving them a competitive advantage that their peers don’t have.
How We Do It:
Optimization vs. Asset Producing 
The process to purchase a perspective company can be long and arduous.  During our due diligence period, we are validating and determining three major points, not just the historical record of the company we are buying.  Those three major points are what we call the “What is, What Should Be and What Will Be”.  
•“The What Is” (TWI). TWI is the defining point of where a company is holistically in a myriad of metrics; Sales, Finance, Ease of Operations, Ownership and Customer Relations to name a few. Subsequently, this is usually the point where most acquirers stop in their due diligence.  We look to define this position not just from a number’s standpoint, but also how does this perspective map out to a larger picture of culture and business environment. 
•“The What Should Be” (TWSB).  TWSB is the validation point of inflection where we use many data inputs to assess if TWI is out of the norm with competitors, and does that data show the potential for improvement.
•“The What Will Be” (TWWB).  TWWB is how we seek to identify the net results or what we call Kinetic Profit (KP) between the TWI and TWSB.  The keywords are Kinetic Profit.  KP is the profit waiting to be achieved by some form of action or as we call it, the Optimization Phase of acquiring a new company.
Optimization:  During the Optimization Phase, we seek to root up employees with in-depth training on various topics.  Usually, these training sessions include; Profit and Expense Control, Production Planning, Breakeven Analysis and Profit Engineering to name a few.  But the end game is to guide these companies to: become net profitable with the new debt burden placed on them post-acquisition, mitigate the loss of sales due to acquisition attrition (we typically plan on 10% of our customers leaving simply due to old ownership not being involved in the company any longer), potential replacement of employees that no longer wish to be employed post-acquisition and other ancillary issues that may arise.  The Optimization Phase usually takes 12-18 months post-acquisition and a company can fall back into Optimization if it is stagnant or regresses in its training.  
Asset Producing:  Asset Producing is the ideal point where we want our subsidiaries to be.  To become Asset Producing, subsidiary management must have completed prescribed training formats, proven they understand the key performance indicators that run their respective departments and finally, the subsidiaries they manage must have posted a net profit for 3 consecutive months.
Diversification 
It is our goal to help drive Alpine 4 into a leading, multi-faceted holding company with diverse products and services that not only benefit from one another as a whole but also have the benefit of independence. This type of corporate structure is about having our subsidiaries prosper through strong onsite leadership, while working synergistically with other Alpine 4 holdings. Alpine 4 has been set up with a holding company model, with Presidents who will run each subsidiary business, and Managers with specific industry related experience who, along with Kent Wilson, the CEO of Alpine 4, will help guide our portfolio of companies as needed. Alpine 4 will work with our Presidents and Managers to ensure that our core principles of Synergy, Innovation, Drive, Excellence are implemented and internalized. Further, we plan to work with our subsidiaries and capital partners to provide the proper capital allocation and to work to make sure each business is executing at high levels. 
In 2016, we saw the beginning of our plan for diversification take hold with the acquisition of Quality Circuit Assembly, Inc. (“QCA”), when Alpine 4 acquired 100% of QCA’s stock effective April 1, 2016. Additional information relating to our acquisition of QCA can be found in our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on March 15, 2016.
In October 2016, we formed a new Limited Liability Company called ALTIA (Automotive Logic & Technology In Action) to create an independent subsidiary for Alpine 4’s 6th Sense Auto product and its BrakeActive product. The company holds two patents on this technology. 
In April 2018, we acquired 100% of American Precision Fabricators (APF) Additional information relating to our acquisition of APF can be found in our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on April 10, 2018.
Effective January 1, 2019, we purchased Morris Sheet Metal Corp., an Indiana corporation, JTD Spiral, Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of MSM, an Indiana corporation, Morris Enterprises LLC, an Indiana limited liability company and Morris Transportation LLC, an Indiana limited liability company (collectively “Morris”).

RCA Batteries
On January 26, 2022, the Company issued a press release to announce the formation of RCA Batteries Corporation (“RCA Batteries”), a joint venture between RCA Commercial and Elecjet Corp. As of the date of this Report, the Company had opted to use RCA Batteries as a brand and not a corporate entity. As noted in the press release, RCA Batteries will reside under Alpine 4’s subsidiary RCA Commercial and will operate as the manufacturer and distributor of the ElecJet family of graphene batteries. Elecjet will continue as a manufacturer of electronic components, a research and development company, and the legal entity holding the company’s intellectual property, including patents and software copyrights. The Company further announced that Samuel Gong will be the President of RCA Batteries while remaining as President of Elecjet.
In March 2022, ElecJet engaged the Battery Innovation Center (BIC) in Newberry, Indiana, to conduct a third-party verification of the specifications of certain of ElecJet’s Class of solid-state batteries previously confirmed by ElecJet in its laboratory. The testing included puncture testing, folding/crumpling tests, and thermal heat tests. The AX Battery Class is a Ceramic Oxide solid-state battery and comes in the form of a 31Ah Solid-State Battery and a 10Ah Solid-State Battery. All of the AX and G-AX Classes are true solid-state batteries and are not semi solid-state batteries. ElecJet engaged the BIC to perform several types of testing, ranging from verification of its charge capabilities, to energy density / power density, to induced failure point testing. The BIC tested two versions of the AX 31Ah the AX-01 and the AX-02. These two subclasses are designed for different market segments.
The AX-01 is an ultra-safe version that can withstand a variety of survivability use cases. The AX-01 has a slightly different material composition that enables its amazing survivability characteristics. The BIC confirmed that the AX-01 withstood being punctured, then folded, and finally crumpled while still holding a charge. The cell was then put through a temperature destruction test where the cell survived to a temperature of 410 degrees Fahrenheit (210 degrees Celsius). Details of the tests are described below:
–Nail Puncture Test: The AX-01 was punctured by a 3mm diameter nail. The nail was left inside the battery, purposely causing the battery to short, of which it did for over an hour while being suspended in the air. The battery's temperature fluctuated but would hover at around 98.6°F (37°C) near the end of the hour with a maximum measured temperature of 101.76°F (38.76°C). Subsequently, the battery was lowered back on to the metal surface for the nail to be removed and the battery quickly returned to room temperature. One amazing feature of the battery was that during the entirety of the test, the AX-01 was holding voltage and remained functional. Note: Traditional lithium batteries typically would instantly catch on fire and go into thermal runaway the moment the battery was punctured.
–Fold/Crumple Test: After the puncture test, the AX-01 was folded over its long side (AX-01 is a long rectangular shape) by a mechanical actuator. After it was folded to the point that both ends were touching each other, the battery was attempted to be folded over again by its short side. After being folded with as much force as the mechanical actuator could press out, the battery remained functional throughout the entire process and remained at room temperature. Note: Standard lithium batteries would normally catch on fire after being folded at even a small angle.
–Thermal Heat Test: The battery was placed in an oven and the oven would slowly and constantly increase in temperature to test the battery's heat exposure breaking point. The temperature of the battery was brought up to 428°F (220°C) before thermal runaway occurred creating a new BIC record. Once the battery eventually caught fire, the fire was unlike other thermal runaways where a battery spews a stream of fire from a concentrated point, but rather was much more contained to the surface area across the battery. Note: Typical lithium batteries would have a thermal runaway at 266°F (130°C) and the previous highest recorded temperature before thermal runaway on cells of similar capacity, with fielded chemistries, at the BIC was 302°F (150°C).
The BIC confirmed that the AX-01 measured a discharge energy of 111.41Wh at a C/2 rate (measured 31.70 Ah)). At a nominal volume of 0.17571 Liters for each cell and a nominal mass of 0.395 kg, this translates to 634Wh/L and 282Wh/kg of energy densities which are both dramatic improvements over current battery technology.
The AX-01 has a designed commercial cycle life of over 1,200 charge cycles. (Please note: this life cycle range was tested only in the Company’s laboratories, and we have not yet received results from the BIC, which generally takes several months to complete.)
The AX-02 is an energy dense cell that also has a high degree of survivability but trades some of the safety material features of the AX-01 for much higher power densities and higher life cycles.
The BIC confirmed that the AX-02 has the capability to charge at 4C. This means that the battery can fully charge in just 15 minutes. The AX-02 is also capable of 7C discharging and over 2,400 life cycles, both of which are currently in the process of being confirmed by the BIC.
The BIC also confirmed that the AX-02 measured a discharge energy of 113.213Wh at a C/2 rate (measured 31.4 Ah). At a nominal volume of 0.17571 Liters for each cell and a nominal mass of 0.395 kg, this translates to 644Wh/L and 287Wh/kg of energy densities which are both dramatic improvements over current battery technology.
Additionally, the Company has been exploring and has had discussions with different battery engineering firms, capital partners and consultants, in anticipation of bringing production of the ElecJet AX Class of batteries to the United States. ElecJet has current plans to begin with a ½ GW battery factory to support non EV customers with products for ESS systems, aerospace platforms and defense systems that need safe reliable power cells. However, the Company anticipates that factory layout and space accommodation will be made for the factory to expand to 5 GW or greater, if demand from potential EV customers increases. The company has narrowed its search to build this factory to Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona; Houston, Texas; and Indianapolis, Indiana, and plans on making a decision on which location to build this factory in the third quarter of 2022. The Company has also taken an equity position in a battery design firm, and is exploring other strategic opportunities relating to production and design of the batteries in the United States.
