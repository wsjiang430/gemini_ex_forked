The Gorman-Rupp Company (“Registrant”, “Gorman-Rupp”, the “Company”, “we” or “our”) was incorporated in Ohio in 1934. The Company designs, manufactures and globally sells pumps and pump systems for use in water, wastewater, construction, dewatering, industrial, petroleum, original equipment, agriculture, fire supression, heating, ventilating and air conditioning (“HVAC”), military and other liquid-handling applications.
 
On May 31, 2022, the Company acquired the assets of Fill-Rite and Sotera (“Fill-Rite”), a division of Tuthill Corporation, for $528.0 million. The Company funded the transaction with cash on-hand and new debt. The results of operations for Fill-Rite from the acquisition date are included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2022.

The Company’s product line consists of pump models ranging in size from 1/4” to nearly 15 feet and ranging in rated capacity from less than one gallon per minute to nearly one million gallons per minute. The types of pumps which the Company produces include self-priming centrifugal, standard centrifugal, magnetic drive centrifugal, axial and mixed-flow, vertical turbine line shaft, submersible, high-pressure booster, rotary gear, rotary vein, diaphragm, bellows and oscillating.
 
The pumps have drives that range from 1/35 horsepower electric motors up to much larger electric motors or internal combustion engines capable of producing several thousand horsepower. Many of the larger units comprise encased, fully-integrated water and wastewater pumping stations. In certain cases, units are designed for the inclusion of customer-supplied drives.
 
The Company’s larger pumps are sold principally for use in the construction, industrial, water and wastewater handling fields; for flood control; for boosting low residential water pressure; for pumping refined petroleum products, including the ground refueling of aircraft; for fluid control in HVAC applications; and for various agricultural purposes.
 
The Company’s pumps are also utilized for dewatering purposes. Additionally, pumps manufactured for fire suppression are used for sprinkler back-up systems, fire hydrants, stand pipes, fog systems and deluge systems at hotels, banks, factories, airports, schools, public buildings and hundreds of other types of facilities throughout the world.
 
Many of the Company’s smallest pumps are sold to customers for incorporation into such products as food processing, chemical processing, medical applications, waste treatment, HVAC equipment, appliances and solar heating.
 
MARKETING 
 
The Company’s pumps are marketed in the United States and worldwide through a broad network of distributors, through manufacturers’ representatives (for sales to many original equipment manufacturers), through third-party distributor catalogs, direct sales, and commerce. The Company regularly seeks alliances with distributors and other partners to further enhance marketing opportunities. Export sales are made primarily through foreign distributors and representatives. The Company has long-standing relationships with many of the leading independent distributors in the markets it serves and provides specialized training programs to distributors on a regular basis with a focus on meeting the world’s water and wastewater pumping needs.
 
During 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were no shipments to any single customer that exceeded 10% of total net sales. Gorman-Rupp continued to actively pursue international business opportunities and, in 2022, shipped its pumps to approximately 130 countries around the world. No sales made to customers in any one foreign country amounted to more than 10% of total net sales for 2022, 2021 or 2020.
 
COMPETITION 
 
The pump industry is highly fragmented and therefore Gorman-Rupp competes with a large number of businesses. Numerous pump competitors exist as subsidiaries, divisions or departments within significantly larger corporations. The Company also faces increased competition from foreign-sourced pumps in most of the Company’s domestic markets.
 
Most commercial and industrial pumps are specifically designed and engineered for a particular customer’s application. The Company believes that proper application, product performance, and quality of delivery and service are its principal methods of competition, and attributes its success to its continued emphasis in these areas. In the sale of products and services, the Company benefits from its large base of previously installed products, which periodically require replacement parts due to the critical application and nature of the products and the conditions under which they operate.

PURCHASING AND PRODUCTION 
 
Substantially all of the materials, supplies, components and accessories used by the Company in the fabrication of its products, including all castings (for which most patterns are made and owned by the Company), structural steel, bar stock, motors, solenoids, engines, seals, and plastic and elastomeric components are purchased by the Company from other suppliers and manufacturers. The Company does not purchase materials under long-term contracts and is not dependent upon a single source for any materials, supplies, components or accessories which are of material importance to its business.
 
The Company purchases motor components for its large submersible pumps, and motors and engines for its pump systems, from a limited number of suppliers, while motors for its polypropylene bellows pumps and magnetic drive pumps are purchased from several alternative vendors. Products requiring small motors are also sourced from alternative suppliers.
 
The other production operations of the Company consist of the machining of castings, the cutting, shaping and welding of bar stock and structural members, the design and assembly of electrical control panels, the manufacture of some small motors and a few minor components, and the assembling, painting and testing of its products. Substantially all of the Company’s products are tested prior to shipment.
 
HUMAN CAPITAL 
 
As of December 31, 2022, the Company employed approximately 1,420 persons, of whom approximately 800 were hourly employees. The majority of the Company’s manufacturing operations take place in the United States, as evidenced by 88% of its employees being in the Company’s U.S. locations and 12% of its employees being in its international locations. 
 
Our approach is to develop talent from within and supplement with external hires. We invest resources to develop the talent needed to remain a leading designer and manufacturer of pumps and pump systems. We provide our employees with training opportunities and educational benefits to assist in the expansion of their careers and skills. This approach has resulted in a deep understanding among our employee base of our business, products, and customers.  We believe that our average tenure of 10 years, as of the end of 2022, reflects both the strong engagement of our employees and our positive workplace culture.  Approximately 8% of our employees operate under a collective bargaining agreement. The Company has never experienced a work stoppage.
 
We provide competitive compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees.  In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by country and region) include profit sharing, a 401(k) plan, medical insurance and benefits, health savings accounts, paid time off, and tuition assistance, among others.  Certain domestic employees hired prior to January 1, 2008, and certain union employees, participate in defined benefit plans.  Non-union employees hired after this date, in eligible locations, participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan instead of the defined benefit plan.  To create performance incentives and to encourage share ownership by our employees, we have implemented an employee stock purchase plan, which enables eligible employees worldwide to purchase the Company’s common shares at a discount through payroll contributions. Because our business involves the manufacturing of products, many of our employees are unable to work from home. For certain positions, we do provide hybrid work from home options.
 
The health and safety of our workforce is fundamental to the success of our business.  We provide our employees upfront and ongoing safety training to ensure that safety policies and procedures are effectively communicated and implemented. We also provide personal protective equipment to those employees who need it to perform their job functions safely.  We have experienced personnel on-site at each of our manufacturing locations who are tasked with environmental, health and personal safety education and compliance, and in certain locations we have an on-site nurse available to our employees for medical needs.
 
We are committed to upholding fundamental human rights and believe that all human beings should be treated with dignity, fairness and respect.  This commitment is outlined in our Human Rights Policy which applies to all employees worldwide including part time and temporary workers. We communicated our expectation that suppliers also adhere to our Human Rights Policy through our Supplier Code of Conduct. We strive to promote inclusion and diversity in the workplace, engage with our communities, and encourage our suppliers to treat their employees in a manner that respects human rights.  We utilize an on-line platform to provide training to all employees worldwide in key areas such as harassment and discrimination prevention, human rights, and our code of conduct.  We also internally publicize the availability of an anonymous ethics hotline through which any employee may report any ethics, safety or other employment concerns.
