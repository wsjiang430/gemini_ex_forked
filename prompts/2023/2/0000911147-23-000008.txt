Overview
Century Casinos, Inc., a Delaware corporation founded in 1992, is a casino entertainment company that develops and operates gaming establishments as well as related lodging, restaurant, horse racing (including off-track betting) and entertainment facilities primarily in North America. Our main goal is to grow our business by actively pursuing the development or acquisition of new gaming opportunities and growing and reinvesting in our existing operations.

We began operating land-based casinos in 1996 with the acquisition of our casino in Cripple Creek, Colorado. In 2006, we opened casinos in Central City, Colorado and Alberta, Canada. In 2007, we purchased a 33.3% ownership interest in Casinos Poland, Ltd. (“CPL”), the owner and operator of eight casinos throughout Poland, and in 2013 we purchased an additional 33.3% ownership interest in CPL, resulting in a majority 66.6% ownership interest. Between 2015 and 2019, we acquired an additional casino and developed two Racing and Entertainment Centers (“RECs”) in Alberta, Canada. In December 2019, we completed our largest acquisition to date, adding three properties to our United States (“US”) portfolio (the “2019 Acquired Casinos”), two in Missouri and one in West Virginia (the “2019 Acquisition”). In connection with the 2019 Acquisition, we entered into a triple net lease agreement (the “Master Lease”) with subsidiaries of VICI Properties Inc. (“VICI PropCo”). In 2022, we acquired 50% of Smooth Bourbon LLC (“Smooth Bourbon” or “PropCo”), which leases the land and building for the Nugget Casino Resort in Sparks, Nevada in which it operates. We currently have a pending acquisition of the operations of the Nugget Casino Resort and another pending acquisition of casino operations in Maryland. See “2022 Business Developments” below.

Operations
We view each jurisdiction in which our casinos are located as separate operating segments and each casino within those jurisdictions as reporting units. Except as described below, we aggregate our operating segments into three reportable segments based on the geographical locations in which our casinos operate. We have additional business activities, including our cruise ship concession agreement and certain other corporate and management operations, which we report as Corporate and Other. The following are our reportable segments:
United States
Canada
Poland
Corporate and Other

2022 Business Developments
Nugget Casino Resort in Sparks, Nevada
On February 22, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement with Marnell Gaming, LLC (“Marnell”), pursuant to which we, through a newly formed subsidiary, (i) purchased from Marnell 50% of the membership interests in Smooth Bourbon, and (ii) will purchase 100% of the membership interests in Nugget Sparks, LLC (“OpCo”). OpCo owns and operates the Nugget Casino Resort in Sparks, Nevada, and PropCo owns the real property on which the casino is located. 

We purchased 50% of the membership interests in PropCo for approximately $95.0 million at the first closing on April 1, 2022 (the “First Closing”). We used approximately $29.3 million of cash on hand in connection with the First Closing. On April 1, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), we entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Goldman Credit Agreement”) by and among the Company, as borrower, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as administrative agent (the “Administrative Agent”) and collateral agent, Goldman Sachs Bank USA and BOFA Securities, Inc., as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, and the Lenders and L/C Lenders party thereto. The Goldman Credit Agreement replaced a credit agreement (the “Macquarie Credit Agreement”) with Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. (“Macquarie”). The Goldman Credit Agreement provides for a $350.0 million term loan (the “Term Loan”) and a $30.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”). The Company drew $350.0 million under the Term Loan to fund the PropCo acquisition, for the repayment of approximately $166.2 million outstanding under the Macquarie Credit Agreement, to fund the Acquisition Escrow (as defined below) and for related fees and expenses. The Company did not draw on the Revolving Facility on the Closing Date. For additional information regarding the Goldman Credit Agreement, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report. 

Subject to approval from the Nevada Gaming Commission, our purchase of 100% of the membership interests in OpCo for approximately $100.0 million (subject to certain adjustments) is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023 (the “Second Closing”). The purchase price for the OpCo Acquisition will be paid from $100.0 million of the proceeds of the Term Loan that were borrowed and deposited in escrow (the “Acquisition Escrow”) on the Closing Date. Following the Second Closing, we will own the operating assets of Nugget Casino Resort and 50% of the membership interests in PropCo. We also have a five-year option through April 1, 2027 to acquire the remaining 50% of the membership interests in PropCo for $105.0 million plus 2% per annum. At the First Closing, PropCo also entered into a lease with OpCo for an annual rent of $15.0 million.

Rocky Gap Casino Resort in Flintstone, Maryland
On August 24, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement with Lakes Maryland Development LLC (“Lakes Maryland”), Golden Entertainment, Inc. (“Golden”), and VICI PropCo, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire the operations of Rocky Gap Casino Resort (“Rocky Gap”) for approximately $56.1 million, subject to the conditions and terms set forth therein. We plan to finance the cost of this acquisition with cash on hand. Pursuant to a real estate purchase agreement dated August 24, 2022, by and between Evitts Resort, LLC (“Evitts”) and an affiliate of VICI PropCo (“VICI PropCo Buyer”), VICI PropCo Buyer agreed to acquire the real estate assets relating to Rocky Gap for approximately $203.9 million, subject to the conditions and terms set forth therein. In connection with the closing of this transaction, one of our subsidiaries and a subsidiary of VICI PropCo will enter into an amendment to the Master Lease to (i) add Rocky Gap to the Master Lease, (ii) provide for an initial annual rent for Rocky Gap of approximately $15.5 million, and (iii) extend the initial Master Lease term for 15 years from the date of the amendment (subject to the existing four five-year renewal options). We expect this transaction to close in the second quarter of 2023.

Recent Developments Related to Century Casino Caruthersville
On October 26, 2022, the Missouri Gaming Commission (“MGC”) approved the relocation of the casino at Century Casino Caruthersville from the riverboat and the barge to a land-based pavilion until the new land-based casino and hotel discussed below are completed. On October 13, 2022, the riverboat, which had operated since 1994, had to be closed as it was no longer accessible from the barge because of record low water levels in the Mississippi River. Prior to its closure, the riverboat casino had 519 slot machines and seven table games. From October to December 2022, Caruthersville operated the casino from the barge with 299 slot machines and four table games. The move to the pavilion, which has 425 slot machines and six table games, was completed in late December 2022. The pavilion building will not be affected by water levels and is protected by a flood wall. The pavilion provides for easier access to the casino for customers, and we anticipate it will bring operating efficiencies and cost savings. We have not experienced a negative impact on results following the move to the pavilion and have had a positive reaction from customers.

Caruthersville Land-Based Casino and Hotel
In July 2021, the Missouri law requiring each casino to be a floating facility was amended to allow casino facilities to be built as a standard building with a container with at least 2,000 gallons of water beneath the facility. A lawsuit was filed by the City of St. Louis that sought to block the implementation of the omnibus bill that included the amendment to the definition of a floating facility. In June 2022, the Missouri governor signed a standalone bill to amend the definition of a floating facility. This change provides an opportunity for Century Casino Caruthersville to move to a non-floating facility. In November 2022, the court ruled in our favor in the lawsuit brought by the City of St. Louis. We plan to build a new land-based casino with a 38-room hotel in Caruthersville, and broke ground on this development in December 2022. The casino at Century Casino Caruthersville will offer over 600 slot machines (with the possibility of an expansion of up to 140 additional slot machines), table games, a restaurant, and a bar. The hotel will be located in a hotel tower between the existing pavilion and the new casino. The new casino and hotel are expected to open in late 2024, subject to final regulatory approval from the MGC as well as other state and local approvals. We estimate the project will cost $51.9 million. To finance the Caruthersville project, we entered into an amendment to the Master Lease with VICI PropCo. Following completion, VICI PropCo will own the real estate improvements associated with the Caruthersville project. As of December 31, 2022, we have spent $2.2 million on this project and received $5.0 million from VICI PropCo.

Caruthersville Hotel
In July 2021, we announced that we had purchased land and a small two-story hotel near Century Casino Caruthersville with plans to refurbish the existing hotel’s 36 rooms. The completely renovated hotel called The Farmstead opened on October 30, 2022 with a grand opening held in December 2022. The total cost of the project was $3.6 million.
Cape Girardeau Hotel
We plan to build a 69-room hotel at our Cape Girardeau location. The hotel is planned as a six-story building with 68,000 square feet that will be adjacent to and connected with the existing casino building. The hotel project has been approved by the City of Cape Girardeau. Construction on this project began in September 2022 and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2024. We estimate the project will cost $30.5 million, and we plan to finance this cost with cash on hand. As of December 31, 2022, we have spent $2.8 million on this project.
Additional Projects
We currently are exploring additional potential gaming projects and acquisition opportunities. Along with the capital needs of potential projects or acquisitions, there are various other risks which, if they materialize, could affect our ability to complete a proposed project or acquisition or could eliminate its feasibility altogether. For more information on these and other risks related to our business, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors” below. 
Terminated Projects
Century Casino Calgary and Century Sports 
In August 2020, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to sell the casino operations of Century Casino Calgary for CAD 10.0 million ($7.5 million based on the exchange rate on August 5, 2020) plus a three year quarterly earn out as specified in the agreement. The transaction closed on December 1, 2020. During the first quarter of 2021, we paid CAD 0.1 million ($0.1 million based on the exchange rate on February 12, 2021) in working capital adjustments under the purchase agreement. Upon closing of the transaction, we entered into a three year lease agreement with the purchaser of the casino operations for annual net rent for the land and building of CAD 0.5 million ($0.4 million based on the exchange rate on December 31, 2022). 

After the sale, we continued to operate Century Sports, and to own the underlying real estate. On February 10, 2022, we sold the land and building in Calgary for CAD 8.0 million ($6.3 million based on the exchange rate on February 10, 2022) at which time we transferred the lease agreement for the casino premises to the buyer and ceased operating Century Sports. Century Sports was included in the Canada reportable segment.

‎


Mendoza Central Entretenimientos S.A. (“MCE”)
In November 2021, our subsidiary CRM sold its ownership of 7.5% of MCE for nominal consideration. In addition, the consulting services agreement between CRM and MCE, under which CRM provided advice on casino matters and received a service fee from MCE, has been terminated. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report for additional information about MCE.

Bermuda
In August 2017, we announced that we had entered into a long-term casino management agreement with the owner of the Hamilton Princess Hotel & Beach Club in Hamilton, Bermuda. We would also provide a $5.0 million loan for the purchase of casino equipment if the gaming license was awarded. In January 2023, the management and funding agreements were mutually terminated because the project was not going forward.
Century Casino Bath (“CCB”) 
In March 2020, CCB was closed due to COVID-19. Due to challenging conditions that included historical and forecasted losses due to changes in the regulatory environment for casinos in England requiring enhanced due diligence of customers, CCB’s board of directors determined that it would enter into creditors voluntary liquidation and control of CCB was relinquished. We deconsolidated CCB effective as of May 6, 2020. The process of voluntary liquidation was completed in October 2022 and CCB was dissolved. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report for further discussion of CCB. 
Capital Needs, Uses and Cash Flow
As a gaming company, our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our casinos and customer spending. Most of our revenue is essentially cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. Our industry is capital intensive, and we rely heavily on the ability of our casinos to generate operating cash flow to maintain operations, fund reinvestment in existing properties for both refurbishment and expansion projects, repay third party debt, and pursue additional growth via new development and acquisition opportunities. When necessary and available, we supplement the cash flows generated by our operations with either cash on hand or funds provided by bank borrowings or other debt or equity financing.
Marketing and Competition
We face intense competition from other casinos within the jurisdictions in which we operate. Many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater name recognition and financial and marketing resources than we do. We seek to compete through promotion of our players’ clubs, enhancement of social networking initiatives and other marketing efforts. In addition to our players’ clubs, we also have various cash and prize promotions and market our casinos through a variety of media outlets including internet, television, radio, print and billboard advertising. Our marketing focuses on competition and other facts and circumstances of each market area in which we operate. Our primary marketing strategy centers on attracting new customers and rewarding repeat customers through our players’ club programs. All visitors to our properties are offered the opportunity to join our players’ club. We maintain a proprietary database that consists primarily of slot machine customers that allows us to create effective targeted marketing and promotional programs, cash and merchandise giveaways, coupons, downloadable promotional credits, preferred parking, food, lodging, game tournaments and other special events. In the United States, our players’ club cards allow us to update our database and track member gaming preferences, including, but not limited to, maximum, minimum, and total amounts wagered and frequency of visits. We have designed reward programs based on total amount wagered and frequency of visits to reward customer loyalty and attract new customers to our properties. Those who qualify for VIP status receive additional benefits compared to regular club membership, such as invitations to exclusive VIP events. 
United States
Colorado – Cripple Creek, Central City and Black Hawk are the only three cities in Colorado that allow gaming, exclusive of two Native American gaming operations in southwestern Colorado, and are located in historic mining towns dating back to the late 1800’s that have developed into tourist attractions. The casino operations in Black Hawk constitute a significant portion of the overall casino gaming market in Colorado (exclusive of the Native American gaming operations), with approximately 58% of the total gaming devices in Colorado and approximately 78% of total gaming revenue in Colorado in 2022. Central City and Black Hawk are located approximately one mile apart and compete with one another for market share. As a result, we view the two cities as one combined market servicing the Denver area. Black Hawk, which we believe does not maintain the same rigorous historical preservation standards as Central City, has been able to successfully attract major casino industry leaders with the ability to offer larger hotels, upscale dining facilities, performance centers and spa facilities. 

No limit single bets at casinos and new casino games were approved and began on May 1, 2021. Some of our competitors may offer larger betting limits or certain games not offered by us, which could attract customers to those competitors. Sports wagering in Colorado became legal in May 2020. We have partnered with sports betting operators that are conducting sports wagering under each of the three Colorado master licenses for sports wagering held by our Colorado subsidiaries. 

 


Our marketing objective for the casinos in Colorado is to create public awareness by positioning our casinos as the premier provider of personal service, convenient parking, the latest gaming products and superior food. In addition to our players’ clubs, we also have various cash and prize promotions and market our casinos through a variety of channels including radio, billboard, print and social media. Cripple Creek, Central City and Black Hawk currently have 12, six and 15 casinos operating, respectively. There are competitors in each city that offer covered parking and more hotel rooms, which may negatively impact our Colorado casinos, particularly during inclement weather and the peak tourist season. In Cripple Creek, a casino across the street from ours is undergoing an expansion. The expanded property could have a negative effect on CRC unless it stimulates increased revenue in the Cripple Creek market.

West Virginia – Mountaineer is located on the Ohio River bank at the northern tip of West Virginia’s northwestern panhandle approximately 30 miles from Pittsburgh International Airport and a one hour drive from downtown Pittsburgh. Mountaineer has four competitors within 50 miles; two in Pennsylvania, one in West Virginia and one in Ohio. Mountaineer primarily attracts customers from neighboring Ohio and from the greater Pittsburgh area. We market this casino as a destination for year-round entertainment. Mountaineer also hosts the annual West Virginia Derby horse racing event.

Missouri – Cape Girardeau and Caruthersville have competitors in Missouri, Arkansas and Illinois. The distance between our Cape Girardeau and Caruthersville properties is 85 miles. While our two properties share a small portion of our customer database, we do not believe that our properties compete against one another for customers. We market our casinos as the premier providers of personal service. In addition to our players’ clubs, our casinos motivate customers by offering various cash and prize promotions, point incentives, and tournaments in addition to other incentives. Our casinos are marketed through a variety of channels including but not limited to radio, billboard, print and social media. Cape Girardeau includes an event center and draws customers mostly from within a 50-mile radius from the property. The closest competitor to Cape Girardeau is located 60 miles away in Illinois. A potential casino in southern Illinois approximately 56 miles from Cape Girardeau, which we expect to open in mid-2023, could increase competition at our Cape Girardeau casino. Caruthersville includes a 27-space RV park. The majority of Caruthersville’s customers reside in Tennessee. The closest competitor to Caruthersville, with the exception of our Cape Girardeau casino, is located in Arkansas and is 90 miles away. A casino expansion at that location in Arkansas, which was completed at the end of 2022, could increase competition with our Caruthersville casino. In addition, there is a proposal to build a casino near Lake of the Ozarks, which requires approval by the US Department of the Interior; however, that project is not expected to directly compete with our casinos as it is over 200 miles from our properties. We believe that our expansion projects at both Missouri locations will allow us to compete for individuals or groups that desire a multi-day visit to Cape Girardeau or Caruthersville. 

Canada
Edmonton – CRA, St. Albert and Century Mile have five competitors, all casinos, in the Edmonton market. The distance between CRA and CSA is approximately 13 miles, and CMR is approximately 30 miles from each of CRA and CSA. We do not believe that our properties compete against one another for customers. Our main marketing activities for these properties focus on casino branding, promoting the racetrack, the player’s club program and promotions made through various marketing channels such as print, television, billboard, mail and social media. CRA is one of two casinos in the city of Edmonton that have both a hotel and showrooms. The property’s showrooms allow us to attract customers to the casino through live music concerts, private concerts, comedic performances, catering and banquet events. In addition, the property is the only casino in the Edmonton market to offer a heated and complimentary parking garage. CRA’s closest competitor is located approximately five miles away. St. Albert includes a small concert and event venue. St. Albert’s closest competitor is located approximately five miles away. Century Mile is the only REC in the Edmonton area. Unique to this property is an 8.0 furlong (1.0 mile) horse racetrack. Century Mile’s closest competitor is located approximately 17 miles away. In January 2022, the Alberta Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis Commission (“AGLC”) removed its moratorium on approving additional gaming facilities. Additional gaming facilities under consideration will be subject to market analysis done by the AGLC and, if approved by the AGLC, could increase competition with our properties.

Calgary - Century Downs has seven competitors (two of which have a combination of hotel and casino) in the Calgary market. Unique to this property is a 5.5 furlong (0.7 mile) horse racetrack. Our casino is one of two casinos in the market with an off-track betting parlor. Using numerous forms of media, such as radio, television and billboards, we concentrate our marketing on the casino floor, the players’ club and racetrack. This property is located one mile north of the city limits of Calgary, one mile from the CrossIron Mills Mall and seven miles from Calgary International Airport. A casino recently relocated approximately eight miles from Century Downs, which could present significant competition. In addition, due to the AGLC’s removal of its moratorium on approving additional gaming facilities, new gaming facilities may be approved by the AGLC, which could increase competition with our property.

Pari-mutuel networks – Century Mile is the exclusive operator of the Alberta pari-mutuel network. In addition to permitting customers to place wagers at off-track betting locations, the network offers advance deposit wagering for online wagering. 



Loyalty program – Our casinos in Alberta participate in the Winner’s Edge, an Alberta-wide casino loyalty program implemented by the AGLC. Players who sign up for the program can earn points that can be redeemed for free play, take part in monthly contests and receive discounts on food in casino restaurants. Our casinos offer Winner’s Edge in addition to our own loyalty program. 

Online gaming – In October 2020, the AGLC launched an online gaming website, “Play Alberta” offering online slot and table games. In September 2021, the AGLC added online sports wagering, including single event sports wagering, to its “Play Alberta” website. The website competes primarily with unregulated online gaming websites that are currently available to Alberta residents. We have not experienced a negative impact to our results of operations in Canada from online gaming; however, increased competition from online gaming could occur and adversely affect our results of operations in Alberta in the future. 

Poland
There are 52 casino licenses available throughout Poland. The Polish government generally forbids the marketing of gaming activities outside of a casino, but the marketing of entertainment is permissible. CPL relies on the locations of its casinos, which are primarily in hotels in major cities throughout Poland, to attract customers. The Polish government issues casino licenses in Poland by district, and there are additional casinos in each district in which CPL operates. For example, five other casinos in the Warsaw district compete with our three casinos operating in Warsaw. The Polish Minister of Finance does not disclose individual casino data. Poland also has slot arcades and online gaming that operate through a state-run company. We have not experienced a negative impact to our results of operations in Poland from slot arcades or online gaming; however, increased competition from slot arcades that are located in the cities in which our casinos are located as well as online gaming could occur and adversely affect our results of operations in the future. 
Seasonality 
United States – Our casinos in Colorado attract more customers during the warmer months from May through September. We expect to attract fewer customers from October through April because weather conditions during this period are variable and can have a significant impact on daily business levels. In West Virginia, we attract more customers from March to August during the racing season. Our casinos in Missouri attract customers throughout the year with the highest business volumes in February and March. 

Canada – Prior to the COVID-19 closures, our casinos in Alberta, Canada attracted more customers from September through April. During the late spring and summer months there is more competition with outdoor activities. Conversely, both Century Downs and Century Mile attract additional customers during the summer months of the racing season. Our off-track betting parlors attract more customers during the peak racing season from May through August. However, we have seen less seasonality since our properties reopened in mid-2021.

Poland – CPL generally attracts more customers from October through March because domestic customers generally vacation during the summer months. 

Governmental Regulation and Licensing
The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities are subject to extensive state, local, foreign, provincial or federal regulations. We are required to obtain and maintain gaming licenses in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct gaming operations. The limitation, conditioning, suspension, revocation or non-renewal of gaming licenses, or the failure to reauthorize gaming in certain jurisdictions, would materially adversely affect our gaming operations in that jurisdiction. In addition, changes in laws that restrict, prohibit or permit gaming operations in any jurisdiction, including the removal of the AGLC’s moratorium on approving additional gaming facilities, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. On February 28, 2023, the AGLC approved a temporary increase from the current 15% of slot machines net sales retained by casinos to 17% effective from April 1, 2023 through March 31, 2025. The increase in slot machine net sales is expected to have a positive impact on net operating revenue and results of operations at our Canadian properties.

Statutes and regulations can require us to meet various standards relating to, among other matters, business licenses, registration of employees, floor plans, background investigations of licensees and employees, historic preservation, building, fire and accessibility requirements, payment of gaming taxes, and regulations concerning equipment, machines, chips, gaming participants, and ownership interests. Civil and criminal penalties, including shutdowns or the loss of our ability to operate gaming facilities in a particular jurisdiction, can be assessed against us and/or our officers to the extent of their individual participation in, or association with, a violation of any of the state or local gaming statutes or regulations. Such laws and regulations apply in all jurisdictions in which we may do business. Management believes that we are in compliance with all applicable gaming and non-gaming regulations. A detailed description of the regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.1 to this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.


Other Regulations
We are subject to certain foreign, federal, state, provincial and local safety and health, employment and environmental laws, regulations and ordinances that apply to our non-gaming operations. We have not made, and do not anticipate making, material expenditures with respect to these laws, regulations and ordinances. However, the coverage of, and attendant compliance costs associated with, such laws, regulations and ordinances may result in future additional costs to our operations.

Rules and regulations regarding the service of alcoholic beverages are strict. The loss or suspension of a liquor license could significantly impair our operations. Local building, parking and fire codes and similar regulations also could impact our operations and any proposed development of our properties.

We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Any violations of anti-money laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our business.

Employees and Human Capital
Employees – As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 2,292 full-time employees and 512 part-time employees. During busier months, a casino may supplement its permanent staff with seasonal employees. We reduced our staffing during 2020 and 2021 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic closures and related issues. We have experienced difficulties attracting and retaining staff at some locations in the US and Canada. As a result, we have had to adjust hours of some food and beverage outlets, the number of table games open and the number of rooms available at some of our hotels. While our employee counts remain below pre-COVID-19 levels and we have open positions throughout North America, we consider our current staffing levels as normal due to a combination of increased efficiencies and the changes discussed above. Approximately 250 employees at our CPL casinos in Poland and 44 employees at Mountaineer belong to trade unions. The trade unions in Poland do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with CPL, but changes in pay of union employees at CPL require approval of the unions. The trade unions at Mountaineer have collective bargaining agreements with Mountaineer.

Human Capital – Our company is led by two gaming industry professionals with a combined industry experience of more than 75 years. Due to extensive industry experience, the team’s diversity of experience gives us the ability to tailor our gaming-based entertainment developments and operations to the unique needs and circumstances of each specific location. We are aware that much of our success is based on our employees’ combined talents, skills and ideas. As an international casino entertainment company, we cater to very different markets with different customer expectations. In order to meet these expectations, we strive to build a workforce that is as diversified as our customers. As of December 31, 2022, 50% of our workforce and 37% of our leadership roles were held by women. 


Focusing on employee development and creating a positive work environment is one of our main priorities. We have training and development programs to provide our employees with the opportunity to succeed and thrive at our company. We seek to provide upward and lateral movement to employees at all locations. In Missouri, for example, we have an Upward Mobility Program to provide front-line employees with information on how they can develop their leadership skills and be prepared to step into a leadership role. This program makes training and educational opportunities available to enhance qualification and permit progress into other career fields through mentorships. 

As a company, we strive to be community leaders and to add value through our products, services, social responsibility and sharing of our financial and human resources to achieve a positive impact on our employees, their families and our fellow citizens. We have committed to supporting the local communities with their requests and needs in an effort to improve the lives of people in these communities. We seek to disburse contributions fairly among several charitable and non-profit organizations. Our management is confident that through working with charitable and non-profit organizations we are able to make a positive difference to the lives of people living in the communities in which we have operations. Our initiatives include donation boxes on the casino floors, volunteer events, fundraising drives, event sponsorships and charity events. Unique to Alberta, Canada is the charitable gaming model in which charitable organizations are licensed to conduct and manage casino events at our casinos.
