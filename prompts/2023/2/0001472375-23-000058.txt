ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
On October 18, 2016, the Company completed the closing of the Transfer Agreement for the sale and transfer of the Company’s 51% interest in All American Golf Center, Inc. (“AAGC”), which constituted substantially all of the Company’s assets. As a result of the closing of the Transfer Agreement, the Company now has no or nominal operations and no or nominal assets and is therefore considered to be a “Shell Company” as that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
 
At this time, our purpose is to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire an interest in business opportunities presented to us by persons or firms who or which desire to seek the perceived advantages of a corporation whose securities are registered pursuant to the Exchange Act.

HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT
 
The Company was incorporated in Nevada on March 6, 1984, under the name “Sporting Life, Inc.” The Company’s name was changed to “St. Andrews Golf Corporation” on December 27, 1988, to “Saint Andrews Golf Corporation” on August 12, 1994, and to “All-American SportPark, Inc.”  on December 14, 1998.  Effective February 15, 2021 the name of the Company was changed to “Global Acquisitions Corporation.”

In December 1994, the Company completed an initial public offering of 1,000,000 Units, each Unit consisting of one share of Common Stock and one Class A Warrant. The net proceeds to the Company from this public offering were approximately $3,684,000. The Class A Warrants expired unexercised on March 15, 1999.

On July 12, 1996, the Company entered into a lease agreement of land in Las Vegas, Nevada, on which the Company developed a Golf Center and All-American SportPark, (“SportPark”) properties. The discontinued SportPark that opened for business in October 1998 was disposed of in May 2001.

On June 15, 2011, the Company entered into a Stock Transfer Agreement with Saint Andrews pursuant to which the Company transferred 49% of the outstanding common stock of All-American Golf Center, Inc. ("AAGC"), a subsidiary of the Company, to Saint Andrews Golf Shop, Ltd. ("Saint Andrews") in exchange for the cancellation of $600,000 of debt owed by the Company to Saint Andrews.
 
Saint Andrews is owned by Ronald Boreta, the Company's President and a Director and John Boreta, his brother. John Boreta is a principal shareholder of the Company and became Director of the Company in 2012. The debt owed by the Company to Saint Andrews was from advances made in the past by Saint Andrews to provide the Company with working capital.
 
On June 10, 2016, the Company entered into a Transfer Agreement for the sale and transfer of the Company’s remaining 51% interest in AAGC, which constituted substantially all of the Company’s assets.  On October 18, 2016, the Company completed the closing of the Transfer Agreement pursuant to which the Company transferred the 51% interest in AAGC to Ronald Boreta and John Boreta (the “Boretas”), and also issued to the Boretas 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, in exchange for the cancellation of promissory notes held by the Boretas and the interest accrued thereon totaling $8,864,255.

In connection with the closing of the Transfer Agreement, AAGC assumed the obligation of the Company to pay Ronald Boreta for deferred salary of $340,000. In addition, AAGC cancelled $4,267,802 in advances previously made by it to the Company to fund its operations.
 
Also in connection with the closing of the Transfer Agreement, entities controlled by the Boretas cancelled $1,286,702 owed to them by the Company. The Company cancelled $27,615 owed to the Company by entities controlled by the Boretas.
 
As a result of the closing of the Transfer Agreement, the Company now has nominal operations and assets.
 
BUSINESS PLAN
 
Our business plan is to seek, investigate, and, if warranted, acquire an interest in a business opportunity. Such an acquisition may be made by merger, exchange of stock, or otherwise. We have very limited sources of capital, and will likely be able to take advantage of only one business opportunity. As of the date of this report we have been investigating business opportunities, but we have not reached any preliminary or definitive agreements or understandings with any person concerning an acquisition or merger.
 
Our search for a business opportunity will not be limited to any particular geographical area or industry and may include both U.S. and international companies. Our management has complete discretion in seeking and participating in a business opportunity, subject to the availability of such opportunities, economic conditions and other factors. Our management believes that companies who desire a public market to enhance liquidity for current stockholders, or plan to acquire additional assets through issuance of securities rather than for cash, will be potential merger or acquisition candidates.
 
The selection of a business opportunity in which to participate may be complex and will be made by management in the exercise of their business judgment which may act without consent, vote, or approval of our shareholders. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and merge with or acquire any business opportunity which will ultimately prove to be beneficial to the Company and our shareholders. Should a merger or acquisition prove unsuccessful, it is possible management may decide not to pursue further acquisition activities and management may abandon such a search and the Company may become dormant or be dissolved.
 
The Company expects that business opportunities will come to our attention from various sources, including our officers and directors, our stockholders, professional advisors, such as securities broker-dealers, investment banking firms, venture capitalists and others who may present unsolicited proposals.

Our management will analyze the business opportunities; however, none of our management are professional business analysts. Our management has had limited experience with mergers and acquisitions of business opportunities. Our due diligence related to business opportunities is expected to encompass, meetings with the target business’s management and inspection of its facilities, as necessary, as well as a review of financial and other information which is made available to our management. This due diligence review may be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage. Our limited funds and the lack of full-time management may limit our ability to conduct an exhaustive investigation and analysis of a target business before we consummate a business combination. We anticipate that we will rely upon funds provided by advances and/or loans from management and significant stockholders to conduct the investigation and analysis of any potential businesses opportunity. We may also rely upon the issuance of our common stock in lieu of cash payments for services or expenses related to any analysis. Management decisions, therefore, will likely be made without independent analysis. We will likely make decisions based on information provided by the promoters, owners or other persons associated with the business opportunity.
 
The legal structure of our participation in a business opportunity may include, but will not be limited to, leases, purchase and sale agreements, licenses, joint ventures and other contractual arrangements. We may act directly or indirectly through an interest in a partnership, corporation or other form of organization. We may be required to merge, consolidate or reorganize with other corporations or forms of business organizations. In addition, our present management and stockholders most likely will not have control of a majority of our voting shares following a merger or reorganization transaction. As part of such a transaction, our existing directors may resign and new directors may be appointed to fill those vacancies without any vote by our stockholders.
 
Our participation in a business opportunity would likely come through the issuance of common stock or other securities.  In certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called "tax free" reorganization under Section 368(a) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") depends upon whether the owners of the acquired business own 80% or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other "tax free" provisions provided under the Code, all prior stockholders would in that circumstance retain 20% or less of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. This would result in substantial dilution to the equity of those persons who were our shareholders prior to such reorganization.
 
Significant stockholders may actively negotiate or otherwise consent to the purchase of all or a portion of their common stock as a condition to, or in connection with, a proposed reorganization, merger or acquisition. It is not anticipated that any such opportunity would be afforded to other stockholders or that such other stockholders would be afforded the opportunity to approve or consent to any particular stock buy-out transaction. We have not adopted any procedures or policies for the review, approval or ratification of any related party transactions.
 
COMPETITION
 
We face substantial competition in our effort to locate attractive business opportunities. Business development companies, venture capital partnerships and corporations, venture capital affiliates of large industrial and financial companies, special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), small investment companies, and wealthy individuals are our primary competition. Many of these entities have significantly greater experience, resources and managerial capabilities than we do and may be in a better position than we are to obtain access to attractive business opportunities.

COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITIES LAWS
 
The Company is subject to the Exchange Act of 1934 and is required to file annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and will be required to timely disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control; acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business; and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on Form 8-K. We are also subject to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act which requires the Company to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding proxy solicitations, as outlined in Regulation 14A. Matters submitted to our stockholders at a special or annual meeting of stockholders or pursuant to a written consent will require us to provide our stockholders with the information outlined in Schedules 14A or 14C of Regulation 14A; preliminary copies of this information must be submitted to the SEC at least 10 days prior to the date that definitive copies of this information are forwarded to our stockholders.
 
Since we are a ‘shell company,”  if we were to acquire a non-reporting company, we would be required to file a Current Report on Form 8-K that would include all information about such “non-reporting issuer” as would have been required to be filed by that entity had it filed a Form 10 Registration Statement with the SEC.
