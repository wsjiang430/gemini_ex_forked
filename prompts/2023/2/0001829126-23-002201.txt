Business Overview
 
Mission
 
Founded in 2008, we are a digital marketplace for waste and recycling and provide cloud-based waste and recycling solutions to businesses and governments. As a digital challenger to status quo waste companies, we have developed and commercialized a proven, cutting-edge platform that brings transparency and environmental innovation to the waste and recycling industry, enabling customers and hauling and recycling partners to make data-driven decisions that can lead to more efficient and effective operations and yield more sustainable outcomes. Using proprietary technology in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence (“AI”), computer vision, and Industrial Internet of Things (“IoT”), for which we have secured more than 60 U.S. and international patents, we have built an innovative digital platform aimed at modernizing the outdated, approximately $1.6 trillion global waste and recycling industry.
 
Through our suite of cutting-edge solutions, we have driven innovation in the waste and recycling industry, reimagined the customer experience, and empowered a wide range of customers, from small businesses to Fortune 500 companies, to municipal and city agencies, to better optimize their waste handling and recycling programs. The implementation of our solutions enables customers to find economic value in their physical waste streams by improving business processes, reducing costs, and saving energy while helping those customers execute their sustainability goals.
 
Our Company
 
We are a leading provider of cloud-based waste and recycling solutions for businesses, governments, and organizations worldwide. Our platform brings new transparency to the waste and recycling industry — empowering our customers and hauling and recycling partners to make data-driven decisions that can lead to more efficient and effective operations as well as more sustainable waste outcomes. Our platform primarily serves three constituents – waste generator customers, hauling and recycling partners, and municipalities/governments.
 
We believe we have built one of the world’s largest digital marketplaces for waste and recycling services. Underpinning this marketplace is a cutting-edge, modular platform that powers a modern, digital experience and delivers data-driven insights and transparency for our customers and hauling and recycling partners. We provide our waste generator customers with a digital marketplace that delivers pricing transparency, self-service capabilities, and a seamless customer experience while helping them achieve their environmental goals. We enhance our hauling and recycling partners’ economic opportunities by democratizing access to large, national accounts that typically engage suppliers at the corporate level. By providing telematics-based and waste-specific solutions as well as access to group purchasing efficiencies, we help large national accounts optimize their businesses. We help governments provide more advanced waste and recycling services that allow them to serve their local communities more effectively by digitizing their routing and back-office operations and using our computer vision technology to combat recycling material contamination at the source.
 
Over the past decade, this value proposition has allowed us to scale our platform considerably. Our digital marketplace now services over 8,000 waste generator customers, including numerous large, blue-chip customers such as Apple, Dollar General, Starbucks, Walmart, Chipotle, and FedEx, which together are representative of our broader customer base. Our waste generator customers are serviced by our network of over 8,000 hauling and recycling partners across North America. We have also deployed our technology in over 90 municipalities within the United States and operate in 20 countries. Furthermore, we have secured a robust portfolio of intellectual property, having been awarded more than 60 patents and 20 trademarks.
 
Our revenues have grown from approximately $359 million in 2018 to approximately $675 million in 2022.

Industry Background & Market Opportunity
 
Massive and fragmented market
 
The global waste and recycling industry is massive. Every human on the planet generates waste, and proper waste disposal is a key public service across the globe. In 2020, the waste and recycling market represented approximately $1.6 trillion on a global basis and was projected to grow at an approximately 3.4% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) between 2021 and 2030 in North America, according to Allied Market Research. The waste and recycling market in North America, our core operating territory, was approximately $208 billion in 2019 according to Allied Market Research.
 
The waste and recycling industry is comprised of multiple segments, and there are many parties with different priorities operating across these segments, which we believe creates friction and inefficiencies for the broader ecosystem. Key segments within the industry include:
 

● | Collection: Involves collecting and transporting waste and recyclable materials from either commercial / industrial sites or residential communities to transfer stations, material recovery facilities (“MRFs”), or disposal sites. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Transfer: The solid waste is then consolidated and compacted to reduce the volume and make the transport to disposal sites more efficient. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Landfill: Landfills are municipal solid waste facilities that collect and bury whatever isn’t sent to MRFs and are the main depositories for solid waste in North America. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Recycling: Facilities that extract reusable commodities out of waste to be repurposed for future use. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Waste & Recycling Brokerage: Third parties that work on behalf of businesses to pair them with suitable waste hauling and recycling services. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The waste and recycling industry in the United States is also highly fragmented. While Waste Management, Republic Services, and Waste Connections (the “Big 3”) are large, publicly traded players with substantial market share in the United States, approximately 85% of the North America waste and recycling market was comprised of non-Big 3 haulers in 2019. Furthermore, the Big 3 haulers have historically pursued acquisitions to drive some of their growth, but we believe this strategy will be less viable for them going forward due to increased regulatory scrutiny over large acquisitions.
 
Stable and Resilient Industry
 
In addition to being a massive industry, the waste and recycling services market is also incredibly stable and resilient. The disposal of waste is considered a mission-critical service in communities across the world. The United States has long been one of the largest waste-producing countries per capita. The United States ranks third highest in the world, with each person producing approximately 25.8 tons of waste per year according to the World Bank “What a Waste” global database.
 
These dynamics have also made the industry resilient against economic downturns. Over the past two U.S. recessions in 2001-2002 and 2008-2009, the contraction of U.S. GDP has been approximately 3.4 times greater than the contraction seen in the waste and recycling industry, based on data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Further, the industry has historically been very profitable, as evidenced by the reported EBITDA margins of the Big 3, which ranged from an average of approximately 26-30% over the period of 2002 through 2022 based on data from FactSet.
 
Industry Trends
 
While the waste and recycling market is massive and stable, several dynamics are driving significant changes in the industry and are creating opportunities to disintermediate the legacy business model.
 
The waste and recycling industry is highly regulated and complex, and public policy is increasingly focused on improving diversion from landfills and reducing emissions. Current policies tend to encourage and reward reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, and many major cities in the United States have promulgated climate action plans committing to achieve emissions reductions.

Concurrently, traditional waste infrastructure is approaching capacity, and we believe large landfill owners are facing more and more hurdles to get regulatory approval to expand their sites or break ground on new sites. Without prospects for expansion, the average remaining life of landfill capacity is declining rapidly. A study conducted by Environmental Research & Education Foundation in 2015 stated at that time that seven states would likely run out of landfill space in the following five years, one state would reach capacity in five to 10 years, and three states had only 11 to 20 years of remaining capacity.
 
Historically, the United States has mitigated this infrastructure capacity issue in part by sending waste abroad. However, foreign countries that have historically accepted waste or recycling have recently begun to reduce or otherwise restrict their imports. For instance, China, which handled nearly half of the global recyclable waste for the past quarter-century according to Yale Environment360, instituted its National Sword policy, which banned the import of most plastics and other materials, making exportation into China extremely difficult.
 
In addition to the logistical problems associated with handling waste, today’s digital-first world has highlighted the industry’s historical under-investment in technology, which has plagued both customers and operators alike. While the large legacy players have been able to rely on their scale and incumbent position, independent operators have been particularly impacted by their inability to make technology investments that could help them optimize their operations and scale more profitably. Meanwhile, given most operators’ lack of technological infrastructure to collect data, customers have historically lacked visibility into pricing and their waste and recycling outcomes, compounding the antiquated, analog customer experience typical of the industry.
 
Challenges for Constituents in the Waste Value Chain
 
Challenges for Waste Generators
 
The preferences and demands of waste generators, who are the customers of the waste cycle, are shifting. They increasingly expect seamless digital customer experiences that provide ease of use and transparency, like those they are experiencing in many other industries and in their personal lives. Corporate consumers are also increasingly making environmentally conscious purchasing and operating decisions, and more and more are looking for greater information to manage and track their operations and hold their service providers accountable for their environmental impact.
 
Incumbent service offerings in the waste and recycling industry have long been outdated and misaligned with the needs and shifting preferences of their customers. We do not believe legacy players have embraced technology, limiting their ability to provide modern customer experiences that deliver efficiency, convenience, and transparency. Furthermore, we believe these players have made substantial investments in landfills, transfer stations, and other infrastructure, incentivizing them to fill and monetize landfills rather than to think creatively and identify alternative solutions, such as diverting waste streams elsewhere or creating circular solutions.
 
Challenges for Haulers and Recyclers
 
Independent waste haulers and recyclers face numerous competitive challenges. Given their limited operating footprint, they struggle to win large, enterprise-class hauling contracts. Without these contracts, the smaller independent players struggle to achieve economies of scale with respect to operating costs and cannot generate sufficient capital to make the substantial investments necessary to modernize their businesses, including the technology upgrades to optimize their operations or improve their customer service experience.
 
Challenges for Governments
 
Municipalities/governments have long identified the impact waste disposal and recycling has on the environment, on climate change, and on community quality of life. There has never been a greater focus on eliminating waste as a means of slowing the rapid advance of climate change, and the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the importance of public health and, consequently, waste management’s crucial supporting role. Sound waste management helps to keep communities healthy while, at the same time, helping to ensure that these communities can thrive, businesses can flourish, and families can live safely. For those communities that are taking tangible steps to make a difference, having credible data is essential for them to take actionable steps to improve the vital service of waste and recycling pick and disposal. With good data, public works departments can better determine where and when to direct human and financial resources to ensure equitable and adequate public services, drive meaningful positive outcomes, and then measure their progress towards limiting waste and achieving the reduction goals promulgated by government leaders.
 
Outside of waste management, municipalities have also struggled to manage budget constraints while still providing vital adequate public services and maintaining critical infrastructure.

Our Solution
 
Without owning any hauling, recycling or landfill infrastructure, our digital marketplace allows us to manage the full spectrum of waste and recycling services through an extensive network of more than 8,000 vendor and hauling and recycling partners. Our programs span cardboard (“OCC”), plastic, paper, metal, glass, pallets, electronics recycling, construction and demolition (“C&D”), organics recycling (including food waste and composting services), grease and oil recycling, and single-stream recycling (“SSR”), among other adjacent services. Our subject matter experts manage recyclable commodity marketplaces, zero-waste programs, and other sustainability offerings across our portfolio.
 
Underpinning our digital marketplace is a cutting-edge, modular, digital platform that allows us to deliver value, transparency, and seamless digital experiences to our customers and hauling and recycling partners. We leverage our technology to audit hauler invoices and match to landfill weight tickets or recyclable commodity bills of lading. We provide customers with dashboards and digital tools to manage and monitor their waste services, and we provide our hauling and recycling partners with technology tools that help them optimize their operations.
 
This platform has been packaged into solutions that we offer to various parties in the waste and recycling value chain. RUBICONSmartCity, an advanced smart city solution, helps municipalities achieve and maintain more efficient, effective, and sustainable waste and recycling operations. RUBICONPremier, an enterprise SaaS solution, allows haulers and recyclers to scale their operations into new geographies more efficiently.
 
Solutions for Waste Generators
 
Our cloud-based digital marketplace provides an innovative customer experience through an easy-to-use interface, where customers can order new services and manage existing services, track invoices, and view environmental outcomes. We provide commercial waste generators—such as commercial property owners, the hospitality and restaurant industries, retail services and logistics companies—an all-in-one waste and recycling solution that allows for enhanced visibility into our customers’ waste management services. This means deeper insights into their waste streams, informed decision making, and increasingly efficient action taken across locations. These features are designed to save time and minimize waste throughout the organization by reducing administrative support costs in managing complex waste and recycling programs, identifying waste reduction and landfill diversion opportunities, and designing and implementing solutions to deliver on them. We also empower customers to report on their environmental goals through data visibility and by aggregating waste diversion activities and generating custom reports on carbon emission reductions. These data and reports are then reviewed and substantiated by a third party.
Solutions for Haulers & Recyclers
 
We work with a network of more than 8,000 hauling and recycling partners. Through our extensive network, we provide our hauling and recycling partners with access to large, often national multi-location accounts that they can service within their local markets or with their narrower service capabilities. We have also developed products that enable haulers and recyclers to better scale their businesses and optimize their operations through several programs.
 
RUBICONPro App
 
The RUBICONPro App sits on the truck dashboard, providing drivers with route details, navigation, and alerts while collecting real-time service information as well as vehicle tracking and safety metrics. Drivers can safely interact with the app to record weight tickets, verify instances of service confirmation, report issues, and more in real time. Without our product, most, if not all, of this work would be done manually and on or through multiple disparate services. Our products can reduce truck repair costs with vehicle maintenance insights, which alert haulers and recyclers regarding everything from routine service needs to severe mechanical issues, creating opportunities to improve performance and operate more efficient fleets.
 
RUBICONPro Pod
 
The RUBICONPro Pod plugs into the existing diagnostics port inside the truck’s cab to automate service confirmations, recording the date and time of services and proactively communicating them to the waste generators. Our hardware and digital platform are compatible with virtually any truck with the requisite port, making this a useful solution for residential, commercial, cart, and roll-off services. Once the pod is installed, no further driver interaction is required.

RUBICONSelect
 
RUBICONSelect is a buying consortium program in which we have negotiated preferred rates with certain third parties specifically for the benefit of our partners that provide waste and recycling services on our behalf. The program empowers haulers and recyclers across the country with new business opportunities, savings, and tools they would otherwise not have access to, all through a user-friendly interface. Foremost is that we offer our hauling and recycling partners new business opportunities to service their own waste generator customers. Given that many of our customers have a national presence (if not international), we believe the only way a local supplier can get access to these important locations is often through us.
 
In addition to helping scale small and medium size business (“SMB”) haulers and recyclers, we leverage the scale of our business to negotiate better, “big-business” pricing and terms for our hauling and recycling partners. Leveraging our scale, which can provide the same buying power as some of the largest waste services companies, the haulers and recyclers in our network are better positioned to successfully compete by reducing their operating costs, thereby freeing up capital that they can invest in their businesses. We have numerous buying program partners, including Commercial Credit Group (CCG), ACE Equipment, Concorde Inc., Wastequip, and more. RUBICONSelect is recruiting new program partners daily to provide a wide breadth of offerings including financing, equipment purchase, rentals, insurance, maintenance, fuel, tires, and more.
 
We have not yet monetized RUBICONSelect but have plans to do so in the near term.
 
Solutions for Governments
 
In addition to working with commercial waste generators and commercial waste and recycling service providers, we have deployed our technology in more than 90 municipalities to help them manage their waste and recycling infrastructure and reach their sustainability goals. We use our proprietary technology to digitize trash and recycling routes, allowing collection crews to cover routes more effectively and efficiently while automating many reporting processes.
 
RUBICONSmartCity is a smart city technology suite that helps city and other municipal governments everywhere run more efficient, effective, and sustainable operations. A software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) offering originally designed for waste and recycling fleets, this full-service solution can be deployed across virtually any fleet to help reduce costs, improve service, and contribute to an enhanced quality of life for citizens.
 
RUBICONSmartCity can help governments save tax dollars by transforming existing government-owned fleets into roaming data collection centers, delivering insights about specific conditions throughout the community. Waste-specific insights include recycling participation and overflowing containers, as well as insights about material contamination directly at the source. Examples of general city infrastructure assessment insights include identifying and indexing instances of road potholes, broken curbs, vacant homes, and graffiti. Our technology helps improve neighborhood streetscapes by monitoring vehicle health, improving driver behavior, and improving material collection efficiency, which can result in more sustainable, resilient, and equitable neighborhoods.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our revenue generated from sales to government entities was less than 5% of our total revenue.
 
Solutions for Global Fleets
 
Our various SaaS offerings help waste and recycling companies around the world to digitize their operations while equipping governments and businesses of all sizes to initiate or grow their waste collection capabilities with a digital cloud-based model. Our solutions allow companies to replicate our innovative, asset-light model by providing a third-party logistics technology backbone and by allowing services to be provided across a wider geographic coverage area than what may otherwise be covered by a vertically integrated asset footprint. Features within the product enable users to provide an enhanced experience for their own waste generator customers, the opportunity to restructure the cost of their collection operations, and the ability to enter new markets without massive investment.

Strengths and Competitive Advantages
 
Our business model provides a transparent marketplace that digitizes the waste and recycling sector for waste generators, municipalities and hauling and recycling partners. We gain, maintain, and grow our customer and partner relationships by providing what we believe are superior solutions that can help all these constituents save money. We believe we have expertise and competitive advantages that will allow us to continue to maintain and grow our market share.
 
Cloud-Based Model Reduces Costs and Benefits from the Network Effect
 
Our business model is highly scalable because of its digital, cloud-based nature; it does not depend on owning any physical infrastructure such as trucks or waste facilities. Without any physical infrastructure and the working capital requirements inherent in those operations, we can efficiently and effectively deploy our platform around the world without the capital investment or the exposure that comes along with owning and operating this infrastructure.
 
Our platform also benefits from significant network effects. As more waste generator customers join our platform, increased waste and recycling volumes improve our ability to negotiate with haulers and recyclers. Increased waste and recycling volumes also create efficiencies within haulers’ and recyclers’ routes and operations, because the marginal cost of servicing additional locations within an existing route is comparatively low, which can improve service and pricing for our customers. Additionally, as the network expands, the amount of data we collect increases, allowing us to learn and further improve our solutions, benefiting all network participants. As our pricing improves with haulers and recyclers and as our expanding data asset improves its ability to deliver new circular solutions, our overall value proposition improves for our waste generator customers.
 
Business Model and Customer Interests are Aligned Benefiting Us and Providing Greater Value to Customers
 
Our platform provides service and cost transparency to both our customers and partners along with automated business processes, allowing them to make informed decisions based on their priorities, whether it’s business growth, cost savings, or environmental outcomes.
 
Our incentives are aligned with our waste generator customers, both economically and environmentally. Landfill owners and operators often generate revenues through collection volumes and tipping fees, so they are incentivized to collect bins more frequently than necessary even when they are not full. Because we do not own landfills, we are not motivated by maximizing volumes and / or tipping fees. Therefore, we can work with our customers to optimize service levels for their business needs. In practice, we advise our waste generator customers on the implementation of new source separated recycling programs and educate store-level employees on how to safely and efficiently manage such program implementation and execution. Additionally, we will work upstream with our customers to design and effect reverse supply chain programs to aggregate valuable waste stream materials at central locations, or even to design programs that create internalized, circular solutions or reduce waste at the source.
 
Further, using our proprietary computer vision-based technology and our team of subject matter experts to examine the contents of a waste stream, we can assess the material composition of the waste stream. This information provides multiple benefits, including providing more detailed information about the contents and allowing the customers to identify opportunities to divert certain materials from landfills. Using this information, we and our customers can generate better environmental outcomes and we can also create significant economic benefits by selling the materials collected from our customers to recycling and processing facilities which often results in additional revenue opportunities and reduced tipping fees.
 
For RUBICONPro, RUBICONPremier, and RUBICONSmartCity, our SaaS offerings, the core of services is about maximizing the use of scarce resources. We do this by optimizing routes and full fleet operations, by providing data for preventative vehicle maintenance, and by focusing on improving driver safety and behavior, which can improve outcomes for all constituents: drivers, supervisors, government officials, and residents.
 
Superior Technology
 
Our user-friendly platform is vertically integrated and gives us control of all critical operations and transaction elements, which facilitates a fast, simple and consistent user experience. We believe our ground-breaking technology is what the industry has needed for many years.

Our technology can affect all parties within the waste and recycling ecosystem:
 

● | We service waste generators’ needs through our network of haulers and recyclers and with vendor management, compliance, invoicing, payments, and receipts managed on our digital platform. We service requests through our proprietary customer portal RUBICONConnect or directly from waste generators via FMS / OMS system integrations, with real-time confirmation of service. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We equip haulers and recyclers with technology to detect location, load and capacity. Haulers and recyclers digitally receive dispatched orders to be configured into their existing routes. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Municipal fleets are equipped with telematics and AI cameras to collect data for asset optimization. The resultant operational efficiencies can drive taxpayer savings, turning a garbage truck into a “roaming data center” that can deliver critical infrastructure assessments for governments all while performing its primary functions. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our technology also helps implement advanced recycling programs, coordinating multiple vendors, directing the waste feedstock to specific processing facilities, and tracking end-destinations for traceability. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We enable data-driven waste management for all our partners, and integrated landfill operators process volumes contracted to us. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Depth & Quality of Hauling & Recycling Network Benefits All Constituent Parties
 
We work with a network of more than 8,000 hauling and recycling partners. The scale of our network means we have access to vastly more hauling and recycling options through our digital platform. Our ability to access this extensive network benefits our waste generator customers and enables us to mitigate business risks for the customers associated with sole sourcing, including labor shortages, cost offsets (overages, contamination, etc.), and unaccommodating supplier scheduling.
 
The stickiness of the supplier side of our marketplace is ensured by the valuable services we provide them. Foremost is that we offer our hauling and recycling partners new business opportunities to service our waste generator customers. Given that many of our customers have a national or even global presence, often the only way a local supplier can get access to these important locations is through us.
 
We also offer our hauling and recycling partners a digital platform that is simple and efficient and can help them improve their routing, fleet operations, and driver behavior.
 
Lastly, we offer the benefits of scale to even the smallest haulers and recyclers through a buying consortium where the haulers and recyclers can save money on items critical to their businesses (fuel, parts, tires, insurance, etc.). We have not yet monetized this buying consortium but have plans to do so in the near term.
 
Number of Blue-chip Customers Creating Barrier to Entry
 
Our platform has been validated by a diverse group of over 8,000 customers in businesses and governments, most of which are under long-term contracts. Our typical customer agreement has a term of 3 years, providing confidence in and visibility towards future revenue streams. Our large and national accounts have also attracted many haulers and recyclers to the platform. Some of our blue-chip customers include Apple, Starbucks, Walmart, Dollar General, Chipotle, and FedEx.
Our Growth Strategies
 
The foundation of our business is our digital marketplace platform where it seamlessly transacts with our customers and hauling and recycling partners. The majority of our revenue is generated via this digital marketplace, which allows us to capture additional revenue streams through solutions designed to modernize hauling and recycling operations. We believe we have multiple proven avenues for future growth, including through increasing our geographic reach and the depth of our customer and hauling and recycling networks in those markets.

Organic Customer Growth Through New Customer and Contract Wins Based on the Strengths of Our Solutions
 
We have built a first-class sales and marketing organization that has helped build our base of more than 8,000 customers. We combine cutting-edge and sorely needed technology solutions with deep subject matter expertise in a mission-critical sector. Our products are designed to save customers money, provide for a more transparent and seamless customer experience, and help customers achieve positive environmental outcomes. This differentiated proposition creates a strong product-market fit within an industry that is ripe for change.
 
Additionally, we are uniquely capable of providing a “one-stop-shop” solution for all the waste generator customers’ waste and recycling needs. We offer a tiered solution, beginning with simply auditing and administering an incumbent hauler’s existing program for waste generators, through to the creation and provisioning of a full zero-waste program.
 
Organic customer growth is expected to continue to be a core driver of growth for us for the foreseeable future as a result of these and other strengths.
 
Growing Revenues with Existing Customers
 
We have proven our ability to expand our customer relationships. This is achieved both by expanding our geographic penetration across a waste generator customer’s footprint over time as well as by working collaboratively with our customers to identify incremental services that can be offered to further enhance their waste and recycling programs. Our waste generator account managers are empowered and incentivized to expand our existing customer relationships.
Adding More Service Capabilities
 
We have demonstrated our ability to expand our capabilities in the past. We have expanded our waste marketplace service capabilities to over 150 material types and multiple fleet types, and even beyond waste and recycling. We intend to continue to add service capabilities and invest in product development and have the platform, vision, and data to fuel growth.
 
From a customer perspective, we currently service national and SMB waste generator accounts, predominately within the U.S. market. Through our SaaS-based offerings, we have already expanded our footprint internationally and expect to continue this expansion – first by leading with technology, then by building out digital marketplace offerings in these markets.
 
As our business expands in its breadth and depth, we will continue to refine how we monetize our products and relationships. Today, we earn money from licensing our technology, from waste and recycling services within our digital marketplace and by participating in recyclable commodity sales transactions. By servicing all the constituents within the waste and recycling ecosystem, we have gathered valuable datasets that we have begun and will continue to offer on their own as data subscriptions. Further, we expect to be a larger player in establishing recycling and recyclable commodity marketplaces.
 
International Expansion within Existing Markets and into New Markets
 
We believe we are a global innovator in the waste and recycling industry and have successfully deployed our solutions in 20 countries though we currently generate the vast majority of our revenue within the United States. We intend to continue selling our solutions globally.
Strategic Acquisitions
 
We intend to grow by acquiring other businesses and the customers they serve. We have proven our ability to identify and execute on attractive acquisition targets. We have acquired and successfully integrated multiple businesses and have established a repeatable process for identifying and integrating complementary companies. Furthermore, we have spent considerable efforts building relationships across the industry, helping to build a large pipeline of additional acquisition opportunities.

Human Capital Resources
 
Our People and Culture
 
We are passionate about our people, and work hard to attract, develop, and retain employees who share our core values and are committed to achieving our mission to end waste. As of December 31, 2022, we had 434 employees, 430 of whom were based in the United States. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our relations with our employees to be very good. A strong commitment to diversity and inclusion is central to our core values in all that we do. We also support the following employee affinity groups: African American Affinity Group, Latin American and Caribbean Heritage Affinity Group, Asian and Pacific Islander Affinity Group, Veterans Affinity Group, LGBTQ+ Affinity Group, and Women in Leadership Affinity Group. The groups meet routinely to discuss matters important to them, host social events and volunteer opportunities, and make presentations at our All Hands meetings to share topics of interest with all our employees.
 
As part of our measures to reduce spending and preserve cash available for the operations, on November 17, 2022, the Board of Directors committed to a reduction in force plan (the “Plan”). The Plan involved a reduction of 55 employees, which was approximately 11% of our workforce upon commencement of the plan.
 
Benefits, Health, Safety & Wellbeing
 
We are proud to offer an employee benefits package that aligns with our commitment to being a great place to work. This includes benefits such as 100% employer paid health insurance for the family unit, an employee assistance program for mental wellbeing, paid maternity and paternity leave, and unlimited vacation for exempt employees. We also focus on the financial wellbeing of our employees with competitive compensation, a 401(k) plan with employer match, and financial education programs.
 
We currently maintain four offices: a headquarters in Lexington, Kentucky; and offices in Atlanta, Georgia, New York, New York and Tinton Falls, New Jersey. The remainder of our employees work from their home.
 
Sales
 
The Commercial Sales organization is responsible for initiatives to drive growth, retention, and overall client satisfaction through new opportunity development, pipeline execution, account planning, and client service.

The Commercial Sales organization is separated into the below business units:
 

● | Key Account Sales: Responsible for sales development and closing new customer accounts with annual revenues over certain thresholds 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Mid-Market Sales: Responsible for sales development and closing new multi-location customer accounts with annual revenues below certain thresholds 
● | SMB Sales: Responsible for leading a highly digitized sales process for primarily single-location new customer accounts for small and medium size businesses 
● | Launch and Implementation: Responsible for overseeing new account setup and expansion projects, irrespective of new customer account size 
● | Partnerships: Responsible for building an eco-system of referral partners and channel sales 
● | Key Account Management: Responsible for managing and growing our existing key account customers 

 
We established a “land and expand” strategy within our existing book of business which we believe has delivered more reliable and substantial revenue growth on a year-over-year basis. This strategy means that we may initially acquire a small footprint of a waste generator customer account, a municipality or a hauler/recycler and over time expand the product offering through the RUBICONConnect platform, RUBICONSmartCity and RUBICONPro.

In order to market our services effectively, acquire new customers, and build brand awareness in key geographies, we deploy a multi-channel marketing strategy designed to reach prospects and expand our relationships with existing customers – a “land and expand” strategy – by communicating the operational benefits and value of our solutions. Our paid marketing campaigns, discussed in more detail below, are augmented by other unpaid/organic activities including regular social media updates and press/media placements. We also use a range of brand assets to further drive awareness of our products and services in high-value and high-visibility placements.
 
Digital – Digital advertising, which includes website display ads, geo-targeted mobile advertising, pay-per-click, and paid search advertising such as Google and Bing, is a central component of our marketing strategy. Given this channel’s precise targeting capabilities, we can effectively and efficiently reach our ideal buyers wherever they are.
 
Social Media – Our social channels are a key part of our marketing efforts. Using both paid and organic programs, we advertise on a number of different social media feeds and channels, including Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Facebook.
 
Offline Media – We run offline advertising campaigns in markets where such opportunities are available and of demonstrable value, including billboards/out-of-home placements, and transit advertising.
 
Events – We participate in many industry and industry-adjacent events identified by our marketing team in close consultation with our Commercial Sales Organization. We also have an enterprise webinar platform which is used to develop and co-host webinars with customers, prospects, thought-leaders, and officials on important waste and recycling industry topics such as food waste and labeling, plastic pollution, and environmental innovation.
 
Special Projects – Each year, we run special projects intended to further our mission and build our profile in our industry and beyond. One of the notable examples is Trick or Trash – our annual Halloween campaign targeted at schools and small businesses, which is designed to mitigate the waste that builds up over the course of the Halloween season.
 
Communications Programs – We pursue media placements with industry and non-industry publications and actively pitches stories to journalists and media outlets to garner additional coverage.

Competition
 
Our industry is highly competitive, and we encounter intense competition from governmental, quasi-governmental and private sources in all aspects of our operations. Our platform and solutions address the needs of a variety of industry participants, including waste generators, haulers/recyclers, and varying levels of government, meaning we compete in a number of segments with a wide array of competitors, including some of our own customers. We principally compete with large national waste management companies such as Waste Management and Republic Services, counties and municipalities that maintain and manage their own waste collection and disposal operations, and regional and local companies of varying sizes and financial resources. Our industry also includes companies that specialize in certain discrete areas of waste management, operators of alternative disposal facilities, companies that seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for renewable energy and other by-products, and other waste brokers that rely upon haulers in local markets to address customer needs.
 
We compete on a variety of factors, including quality of services, ease of doing business and price.
 
Product Development
 
We continue to make substantial investments in product development because we believe it is essential to improve and optimize our platform and underpins our goal to drive innovation in the waste and recycling industry. Our product development roadmap balances technology advances and new offerings with regular enhancements to existing solutions. We are continuously looking for ways to improve our proprietary platform and solutions, following a roadmap to build and deliver additional functionalities to our customers and partners. Our allocation of product development resources is guided by management-established priorities, input from team members, and user and sales force feedback.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 48 employees focused on our product development activities. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our product development spending was $37.8 million and $22.5 million, respectively, and, as a percentage of total revenues, was 5.5% and 3.9%, respectively. We intend to continue to invest in our product development capabilities to extend our platform.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Intellectual property rights are critical to our success. We rely on a combination of patents, copyright, trademark, and trade secrets in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, and other contractual protections, to protect our intellectual property rights, including our proprietary platform, software, know-how, and brand. As of February 28, 2023, we had more than 60 patents granted in the United States and internationally combined. Among other things, our patents and published patent applications address hauler and vendor facing innovations that enable monitoring and management of waste hauling vehicles including service confirmation, load monitoring, vehicle weight determination, bin overflow detection, route determination, intelligent dispatching, unscheduled stop detection, and remote waste auditing; customer-facing innovations that allow customers to make on-demand service requests, remotely manage waste services, request bulk material removal, and track waste receptacles; innovations related to intelligent dispatching, remote auditing, route generation, and residential waste management systems; and smart cities innovations including systems for monitoring waste service regulation and compliance data, road condition detection, smart bins and sensors offering use-based incentives, and air quality-based waste management. In addition, from time to time we enter into collaboration arrangements and in-bound licensing agreements with third parties, including certain of our competitors, in order to expand the functionality and interoperability of our solutions. We are not substantially dependent upon any one of these arrangements, and we are not obligated to pay any material royalty or license fees with respect to them.

Regulation
 
The waste and recycling industry is highly regulated with a complex array of laws, rules, orders and interpretations governing environmental protection, health, safety, land use, zoning, transportation and related matters. These regulations and related enforcement actions can significantly restrict operations of landfill operators and haulers by imposing: limitations on siting and constructing new or expanding existing waste disposal, transfer, recycling or processing facilities; limitations or levies on collection and disposal prices, rates and volumes; limitations or bans on disposal or transportation of out-of-state waste or certain categories of waste; mandates regarding management of solid waste, including requirements to recycle, divert or otherwise process certain waste, recycling and other streams; or limitations or restrictions on the recycling, processing or transformation of waste, recycling and other streams. Additionally, landfill operations emit anthropogenic methane, identified as a greenhouse gas, and vehicle fleets emit, among other things, carbon dioxide, which also is a greenhouse gas, and efforts to curtail the emission of these and other greenhouse gases and to ameliorate the effects of climate change continue to progress. Although passage of comprehensive, federal climate change legislation may not occur in the near term, any such legislation, if enacted, could significantly restrict and impose significant costs on the waste industry. Although we do not own or operate landfills or transfer stations nor do we operate as a hauler, many of our customers and third parties with whom we contract are in one or more of these categories, and therefore subject to the foregoing regulations.
