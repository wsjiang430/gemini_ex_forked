Item 1. Business
Our Company
Vacasa, Inc. is the leading vacation rental management platform in North America. Our integrated technology and operations platform is designed to optimize vacation rental income and home care for homeowners, offer guests a seamless, reliable, and high-quality experience, and provide distribution partners with a variety of home listings. Our marketplace aggregates approximately 44,000 listings in over 500 destinations in the United States, Belize, Canada, Costa Rica, and Mexico. Our guests are able to search, discover, and book properties on Vacasa.com, our Guest app, and on the booking sites of distribution partners including Airbnb, Booking.com, and Vrbo. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated approximately $2.6 billion in Gross Booking Value ("GBV") from over six million Nights Sold.
Our business model is based on shared success. As a vertically-integrated property manager, we act as an agent on behalf of our homeowners, which allows us to avoid the capital requirements of owning the underlying real estate. We collect nightly rent from guests on behalf of homeowners and earn the majority of our revenue from homeowner commissions and service fees paid by guests.
Since our inception, we have focused primarily on the supply side of the short-term rental market and on growing our homeowner base. Booking channels such as Airbnb, Booking.com, and Vrbo have historically had more focus on the demand side of the market and collectively drive hundreds of millions of site visits each month.
Through our integrated technology and operations platform, we unlock new supply and increase the availability of vacation rental home listings for guests to discover and book. Our comprehensive set of capabilities, enabled by technology, is designed to remove barriers to renting vacation and second homes by solving critical challenges for homeowners such as listing creation and merchandising, pricing optimization, multi-channel distribution and demand generation, home care, insights and analytics, smart home technology, and customer support.
Our global marketplace connects guests with the homes we bring onto our platform. Our listings are aggregated on vacasa.com and on the sites of major demand channels. Our direct channel, which includes our booking site and Guest app, has become a significant source of guest demand, driving approximately 30% of GBV for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Developments in Our Business
Reverse Recapitalization
On July 28, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to become a publicly traded company through a business combination with TPG Pace Solutions Corporation, a Cayman Islands exempted company ("TPG Pace").
On December 6, 2021, we consummated (the "Closing") the business combination (the "Business Combination") contemplated by that certain business combination agreement, dated as of July 28, 2021 (as amended, the "Business Combination Agreement"), by and among TPG Pace, Vacasa Holdings, Turnkey Vacations, Inc., a Vacasa Holdings equity holder ("TK Newco"), certain other Vacasa Holdings equity holders (together with TK Newco, the "Blockers"), us, and certain other parties, pursuant to which, among other things, TPG Pace merged with and into us, following which the separate corporate existence of TPG Pace ceased, and we became the surviving corporation. The transactions set forth in the Business Combination Agreement are further described in Note 3, Reverse Recapitalization to our consolidated financial statements.
TurnKey Acquisition
On April 1, 2021, we acquired the operations of TurnKey Vacation Rentals ("TurnKey"), a provider of property management and marketing services for residential real estate owners in the United States (the "TurnKey Acquisition"). The TurnKey Acquisition advanced our strategy to create a premium standard for vacation rentals. The acquisition also increased our market density in regions where we had existing operations and expanded our footprint into several other top vacation rental destinations. See Note 4, Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements.

Our Growth Strategy
We continue to focus on addressing our market opportunities, including:
•Optimize existing supply. We expect to continue to innovate on our platform to expand our technology advantage, improve our operational efficiency, grow Nights Sold, and manage homeowner churn.
•Grow supply in existing markets. We intend to grow our footprint and increase density in existing markets to achieve further economies of scale, primarily using our individual approach to onboard individual vacation rental properties through our direct sales force.
•Expand our range of homeowner services. We intend to leverage our homeowner relationships to monetize adjacent services and expand our suite of product offerings. Our expanded range of homeowner services may include multiple service levels for homeowners who want or need assistance with select aspects of our end-to-end offering. We believe these services also have the potential to funnel more homeowners into our core product over time.
•Elevate the guest experience. We plan to elevate the guest experience with enhanced technology and services, including our Guest app and smart home technology.
•Expand into new domestic markets. We may also continue to selectively establish footholds in new domestic markets, using a portfolio approach, which was historically our primary strategy for entering new markets. Our portfolio approach is designed to capitalize on the footprint of highly fragmented, professionally managed, local property portfolios and allows us to port dozens of existing vacation rental homes to our platform simultaneously to build our local market presence at a faster rate.
•Expand into international markets. We currently have an international footprint in Belize, Canada, Costa Rica, and Mexico. Over time, our new market expansion may include selective entry into attractive international markets, primarily in Europe and the Americas.
Our Platform and Product Offerings
Our platform is designed to deliver a comprehensive offering to homeowners looking to rent their vacation homes and guests looking to experience the potential that vacation rentals can offer.
Offerings for Homeowners
We have designed our platform with a homeowner-first approach. Our homeowner offering includes products and services designed to enable homeowners to optimize rental income from their properties while outsourcing the care and management of their property. Our homeowner offering includes:
•Property setup and listing optimization. We promptly handle the comprehensive steps needed to allow a homeowner's home to be listed for rent. We offer design resources, professionally written descriptions, professional home photography, and feature and amenity recommendations in order to maximize guest appeal. Once a listing is live, we handle all aspects of marketing, calendar management, and guest interaction.
•Demand generation. Our proprietary software automatically syndicates listings across our direct booking site and on the booking sites of third-party distribution partners, including Airbnb, Booking.com, and Vrbo. We have also built tools to allow for granular modifications on listings or prices by channel. We strive to optimize our listings across our partner network to maximize bookings regardless of channel.
•Dynamic pricing. We strive to optimize the total rental revenue for our homeowners. We use artificial intelligence to predict how and when we can deliver the maximum yield for homeowners and price the home accordingly. To achieve this optimization, we continuously adjust rental rates across all our channels based on a guest's itinerary, a home's availability, and real-time booking dynamics. Our data scientists and machine learning engineers continually test for optimization, iterate, and release new algorithms in an effort to improve revenue per available night.
•Tax and compliance support. We strive to simplify compliance and tax-related tasks for homeowners. We collect and remit transient occupancy taxes through our platform and may assist with filing necessary permits for vacation rental properties in certain jurisdictions.

•Real estate analytics. We offer homeowners analytics about vacation rental activity. We provide rental projections to help buyers make informed decisions about potential purchases.
•Homeowner dashboard and mobile app. Homeowners can access their booking, payment, and performance details on our homeowner portal or via our mobile app.
•End-to-end property care. We strive to deliver comprehensive home care, including housekeeping, maintenance, inspection, and related services to homeowners.
Offerings for Guests
For guests, our offerings are designed to provide a frictionless way to search, discover, transact, and experience Vacasa listings. Our guest offerings include:
•Direct booking site. Our booking site serves as our own demand channel. Approximately 30% of GBV was generated through our direct channel, which includes our booking site and Guest app, in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.
•Payment capabilities. We offer guests multiple payment options, including payment plans offered through our partnership with Affirm.
•24/7 support. Our customer support team is available 24/7 and is accessible via phone, vacasa.com, or our Guest app.
•Smart home technology. Our smart home technology includes keyless locks, Wi-Fi routers, and noise monitoring technology.
•Guest app. Our Guest app is designed to drive guest demand, engagement, and satisfaction. Our Guest app includes a comprehensive suite of features for before, during, and after a guest’s stay. For example, guests are able to search, book, and pay for their stay through the app. The Guest app also facilitates access to the property, Wi-Fi connection, and our 24/7 support.
Technology Utilized by our Local Operations Teams
Our teams perform home care in over 500 destinations and are key to delivering an enhanced level of service to our homeowners and guests at the local level. Underpinning our local operations teams is our proprietary technology that guides all aspects of home care. These capabilities include:
•HomeCare Hub. Our HomeCare Hub is a proprietary software tool purpose-built for vacation rentals. Our HomeCare Hub allows us to optimize staffing, assignments, dispatching, and workflows across our local markets. Operations managers are able to monitor the homes in their portfolio 24/7 with bi-directional flow of information from the property. Furthermore, we have built application program interface integrations to vendors to maximize efficiency in the process. Our AI-driven software solution is designed to continuously improve and enhance our operational effectiveness over time.
•Field application. Our field application is leveraged by our home care staff, maintenance personnel, and local managers and is connected into our HomeCare Hub software tool to enhance coordination between managers, contractors, and field personnel. Our proprietary application provides visibility to our field team on assigned tasks and open tickets. The field application is used in a myriad of ways, such as to monitor guest check-out status and to facilitate accelerated cleans and post-cleaning photo submissions for real-time inspection approval.
•Ticketing system and time tracking. We provide comprehensive management of employee activity on our platform to track and manage workflows and productivity.
•Smart home technology. Smart home technology, such as smart locks, improves our operational efficiency. For example, local staff do not need to visit homes to change lock box codes or replace lost keys, and certain locks can be programmed to trigger notifications when a guest checks in or out. We utilize this data to inform our scheduling algorithms, which improves the efficiency of our local teams running home care.

Our Development and Technology Infrastructure
We have a research and development team responsible for delivering enhancements to the functionality, usability, and performance of our platform. We have assembled a team of engineers, designers, product managers, and data scientists whose expertise spans a broad range of technical areas.
Sales and Marketing
Our marketing strategy primarily relies on performance marketing, which we complement with engagement marketing and brand marketing. We deploy performance marketing strategies through digital and offline channels to drive additional traffic from prospective guests. Engagement marketing initiatives include email and other outbound communications to ensure that we retain high-value homeowners and guests. Brand marketing increases awareness among potential homeowners and guests, helping them understand the benefits of renting their home through Vacasa and of booking and experiencing a Vacasa property. In addition to performance, engagement, and brand marketing, we engage in public relations and communications activities to strengthen our brand among homeowners and guests.
We deploy focused sales efforts targeted at homeowners of properties we predict will be high-value listings on our platform. Once prospects are identified, our sales executives work to convert homeowners to our platform. Our sales executives have crucial area relationships and referral networks.
Our Distribution Partners
As part of our multi-channel distribution strategy, we have established relationships with numerous booking sites, including Airbnb, Booking.com and Vrbo, which make Vacasa-listed properties available for booking by guests through their online platforms. Bookings through our distribution partners accounted for approximately 70%, 70% and 65% of our GBV during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
Our agreements with our distribution partners typically provide either that (i) the partner will receive a commission on bookings made through the channel transactions (with the rate varying by partner) or (ii) we will pay the partner a fixed subscription fee, typically on an annual, per-listing basis. Certain partners may charge guests additional fees directly.
Human Capital
Our People
As of December 31, 2022, we employed a total of approximately 7,900 team members globally. Our dedicated local operations teams work directly with our homeowners to provide comprehensive vacation rental management services and exceptional care for our guests. Our field teams are supported by our central team employees who work in our offices or remotely. This group is composed of engineers, product managers, marketers, operations leads, finance professionals, human resources, and legal personnel.
We are committed to hiring a diverse workforce. We seek to foster an inclusive environment where everyone feels welcome to be their authentic selves and all voices are heard and to create an environment that is aligned with our values and that reflects our global community.
Our Culture
At Vacasa, we are reimagining the vacation rental experience for homeowners and guests through our end-to-end technology platform.
Vacasa’s culture has grown and evolved along with its people. We started in 2009 with one home and a small team. As of December 31, 2022, we managed approximately 44,000 homes with a team of professionals across the travel and hospitality industry. Even with this scale, we strive to maintain an entrepreneurial spirit. We hold ourselves accountable to the values we’ve grown into as a company, which guide our decision making:
•Innovation: We look to the future and anticipate what’s next.
•Accountability: We are committed, purposeful and intentional. We take aim and follow through with decisive action.
•Growth: We set the bar high and push ourselves and our teammates to continually expand, improve and progress.
•Empathy: We listen closely, engage thoughtfully and cultivate lasting relationships built on mutual benefit and trust.

Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
Our culture is also one of inclusion. We continuously aspire to be a more equitable, safe, and welcoming work environment for all of our team members, and a better advocate to the communities we serve.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive environment. As we seek to expand our geographic footprint and grow our business globally, we face competition in attracting and retaining homeowners and guests.
Homeowners. Homeowners can either self-manage or use local property management businesses to market and care for their homes. Homeowners who self-manage are able to list on sites such as Airbnb, Booking.com, and Vrbo and may choose to leverage additional software tools to handle aspects of the process such as pricing or scheduling. We compete for homeowners based on many factors, including the volume and pricing of bookings generated by guests on our platform and those of our distribution partners; ease of onboarding onto our platform; the service fees and commissions we charge; the owner protections we offer, such as our insurance programs; and the strength of our brand.
Guests. We also compete to attract guests to our platform. Guests have a wide range of options for finding and booking accommodations, and as such, we compete with other forms of accommodations including hotels, other vacation rental companies, and serviced apartment providers, both online and offline. We also compete for traffic and demand generation through our direct booking channel with nationally recognized booking sites such as Airbnb, Booking.com, Vrbo, regional booking sites, and online travel agencies, and to a lesser degree, urban rental sites such as Sonder, and niche programs such as Inspirato. We compete for guests based on many factors, including: the uniqueness and quality of our homes and the availability of homes; the value and all-in cost of our offerings relative to other options, our brand; and the ease of use of our platform.
We believe we compete favorably on the basis of the key competitive factors noted above. However, many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater financial, technical and other resources, including greater brand name recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets and established marketing relationships, access to larger customer bases and significantly greater resources for the development of their offerings. See Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—The business and industry in which we participate are highly competitive, and we may be unable to compete successfully with our current or future competitors.”
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property is an important component of our business. We rely on a combination of trademarks, domain names, copyright, patents, know-how and trade secrets, as well as contractual provisions and restrictions, to establish and protect our intellectual property. As of December 31, 2022, we held two U.S. patent applications, which were published in April 2021 and remain in progress, and one patent acquired through the TurnKey Acquisition. While we believe our patent applications and registration are important to our competitive position, we do not believe any single patent application or registration is material to our business as a whole. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective.
As of December 31, 2022, we owned 49 U.S. and 63 international (across 53 countries) registered or pending trademarks, including “Vacasa” and related logos and designs. We also own several domain names that we use in, or relate to, our business, including “vacasa.com” and other country code top level domain name equivalents.
We rely on trade secrets and confidential information to develop and maintain our competitive advantage. We seek to protect our trade secrets and confidential information through a variety of methods, including confidentiality procedures and non-disclosure agreements with employees, third parties, and others who may have access to our confidential or proprietary information. We also require our employees to sign invention assignment agreements with respect to inventions arising from the course of their employment, and we restrict unauthorized access to our proprietary technology. In addition, we have developed proprietary code and algorithms that are protected through a combination of copyright and trade secrets.
Notwithstanding our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that the measures we take will be effective or that our intellectual property will provide any competitive advantage. We cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our currently pending or any future applications, or that any of our issued patents will adequately protect our proprietary technology. Our intellectual property rights may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Furthermore, the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect intellectual property and proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and, as a result, we may be unable to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary

rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. In addition, while we have confidence in the measures we take to protect and preserve our trade secrets, we cannot guarantee that these measures will not be circumvented, or that all applicable parties have executed confidentiality or invention assignment agreements. In addition, such agreements can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies should any such breach occur. Accordingly, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or independently discovered by competitors. For more information regarding the risks related to intellectual property, see Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Information Technology, Data Security and Data Privacy.”
Data Privacy and Security
The protection of identifiable information about individuals, often referred to as personal data, that we collect is important for ensuring trust with our stakeholders. In the course of operations, we collect and process a variety of personal data from interactions with customers and visitors, use of our websites and/or applications, social media, advertisements, or communications with us relating to any services we offer. We also collect personal data from job applicants, employees, independent contractors, and employees of certain companies with which we work.
We store, protect, use and transmit personal data in accordance with our online privacy policy and internal data security and data handling policies and procedures, in addition to a variety of industry-standard technical, administrative, and physical measures. We also employ a variety of measures designed to comply with our legal obligations in relation to the collection and processing of personal data.
Such measures include, but are not limited to: specifying collection and processing purposes; restricting the use of personal data to specified purposes; minimizing the collection and retention of personal data beyond what is required for our operations; anonymizing, pseudonymizing, or otherwise obfuscating certain personal data; encrypting personal data; administering privacy awareness training; and managing service providers processing personal data on our behalf.
We are subject to a variety of data privacy and security laws and regulations across multiple jurisdictions where we have operations, employees or guests, which set forth a variety of compliance requirements related to the collection and processing of personal data. To support compliance with such requirements, we maintain cross-functional and interdisciplinary privacy procedures, including, but not limited to the following areas: data subject (consumer) rights; training and awareness; vendor management; data retention and destruction; privacy policy management; and incident management.
Regulations
We are subject to a wide variety of laws, rules, and regulations enforced by both governments and private organizations. Many of these rules and regulations are constantly evolving. If we are unable to comply with them, we could be subject to civil and criminal liabilities, revocation, or suspension of our licenses or other adverse actions. We may also be required to modify or discontinue some or all of our offerings, and our ability to grow our business and our reputation may be harmed. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for a discussion of our regulatory risks.
Short-Term Regulatory Considerations in the Markets in which we Operate
We operate in hundreds of locations across the United States, with varying sets of rules and regulations associated with each state, county, city, town, township, or village. We typically focus our operations in markets whose jurisdictions allow for un-hosted, non-owner occupied short-term rentals, and avoid major cities, such as San Francisco and Denver, that only allow “homeshares,” which are rentals of all or a portion of the owner’s primary residence. Occasionally, however, past acquisitions of other management companies have included a small number of rentals that are subject to these primary residence rules.
With very few exceptions, owners of the properties we manage are ultimately responsible for obtaining and maintaining applicable permits, licenses, and tax registrations, and for complying with local zoning restrictions as well as restrictive covenants and homeowner association bylaws. We often assist with permitting, licensing, and taxation to the extent we are legally able, and work hard to verify and help ensure compliance with state and local laws for all of our homes. If violations occur, we strive to move quickly to assist owners in correcting them and abide by the decisions of government officials.
Some states require short-term rentals to be offered through a licensed real estate broker. Where applicable, we offer and operate rentals through a licensed subsidiary.

Real Estate Regulatory Considerations for our Business Operations
As discussed above, our vacation rental property management operations are considered real estate services in certain states. In addition, our buy/sell real estate brokerage services, offered separately in select states, are considered real estate services. Real estate service providers must be licensed at a brokerage or broker level, and are commonly referred to as a real estate brokerage. Real estate brokerages are licensed at the state level and are primarily regulated by state level agencies dedicated to real estate or licensing services.
State Regulation
Real estate brokerage licensing laws vary widely from state to state. All entities and individuals providing brokerage services must be licensed separately in each state where they operate. Generally, a corporate entity must obtain a firm level license, although in some states the licenses are personal to individual brokers and an entity is associated with the individual broker’s license. Where a firm license is obtained, an individual broker is appointed as the principal broker. Licensed agents or salespersons must also obtain a license and affiliate their license under a firm or a principal broker to engage in licensed real estate brokerage activities.
The principal broker in each state is responsible for compliance with licensing laws and for actively supervising the licensed brokerage activities of all its licensees within the state. All licensed market participants, whether individuals or entities, must also comply with a state’s real estate licensing laws and regulations. The licensing laws and regulations vary in each state, but generally detail minimum duties, obligations, and standards of conduct for licensees include requirements related to contracts, disclosures, record-keeping, local offices, handling of trust funds, agency representation, advertising regulations, and fair housing regulations. In each of the states where our operations require, we have designated a properly licensed principal broker and, as required, we also hold a corporate real estate broker’s license.
Federal Regulation
Several federal laws and regulations govern the real estate brokerage business, including federal fair housing laws such as the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 ("RESPA"), and the Fair Housing Act of 1968 ("FHA"). RESPA restricts kickbacks or referral fees that real estate settlement service providers such as real estate brokers, title and closing service providers and mortgage lenders may pay or receive in connection with the referral of settlement services. RESPA also requires certain disclosures regarding certain relationships or financial interests among providers of real estate settlement services.
RESPA provides a number of important exceptions that allow for payments or referral commissions to be made and received between licensed real estate brokers and for market-rate compensation payments between service providers for services actually provided. RESPA is administered by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"). The CFPB has applied a strict interpretation of RESPA and related regulations, and often enforces these regulations in administrative proceedings. Consequently, industry participants have modified or terminated a variety of historical business practices to avoid the risk of protracted and costly litigation or regulatory enforcement.
The FHA prohibits discrimination or any preference in housing because of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status and disability. The FHA applies to real estate brokers and licensees involved in the purchase or sale of homes and to the non-transient rental of homes. The FHA also applies broadly to many forms of advertising and communications, including Multiple Listing Service ("MLS") listings, websites and social media postings.
Local Regulation
In addition to state and federal regulations, residential transactions may also be subject to local regulations. These local regulations generally require additional disclosures by parties or licensees in a residential real estate transaction, or the receipt of reports or certifications, often from the local governmental authority, prior to the closing or settlement of a real estate transaction. Local regulations also may expand those protected from housing discrimination laws by protecting additional classes of people and providing additional fair housing laws.
MLS Rules
Our real estate buy/sell brokerages are also subject to rules, policies, data licenses, and terms of service established by over 50 MLSs of which we are a participant. These rules, policies, data licenses and terms of service specify, among other things, how our licensees may access and use MLS data and how MLS data must be displayed on websites we control or that our licenses maintain. The rules of each MLS to which we belong can vary widely and are complex.
Table of Contents

National Association of REALTORS ("NAR")
NAR, as well as state and local associations of REALTORS, have codes of ethics and rules governing members’ actions in dealings with other members, clients, and the public. Our licensees and licensed entities must comply with these codes of ethics and rules as a result of membership in these organizations.
Seasonality
Our overall business is seasonal, reflecting typical travel behavior patterns over the course of the calendar year. In addition, each market where we operate has unique seasonality, events, and weather that can increase or decrease demand for our offerings. Certain holidays can have an impact on our revenue by increasing Nights Sold on the holiday itself or during the preceding and subsequent weekends. Typically, our second and third quarters have higher revenue due to increased Nights Sold. Our GBV typically follows the seasonality patterns of Nights Sold. Our operations and support costs also increase in the second and third quarters as we increase our hourly staffing to handle increased activity in those periods.
