Item 1. Business
General
Telos Corporation is a Maryland corporation headquartered in Ashburn, Virginia. Telos Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (the "Company" or "Telos" or "We"), offers technologically advanced, software-based security solutions that empower and protect the world's most security-conscious organizations against rapidly evolving, sophisticated and pervasive threats. Our portfolio of security products, services and expertise empowers our customers with capabilities to reach new markets, serve their stakeholders more effectively, and successfully defend the nation or their enterprise. We protect our customers' people, information, and digital assets so they can pursue their corporate goals and conduct their global missions with confidence in their security and privacy.
We completed our initial public offering ("IPO") on November 19, 2020, and a follow-on offering on April 6, 2021. In addition, on July 30, 2021, we acquired the assets of Diamond Fortress Technologies ("DFT") and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Our Mission
Our mission is to protect our customers' people, systems, and vital information assets with offerings for cybersecurity, cloud security, and enterprise security. In the current global environment, our mission is more critical than ever. The emergence of each new information and communications technology ("ICT") introduces new vulnerabilities, as security is still too often overlooked in solution development. Networks and applications meant to enhance productivity and profitability often jeopardize an organization due to poor planning, misconfiguration, or an unknown gap in security. Ransomware, insider threats, cybercrime, and advanced persistent threats continue to menace public and private enterprises across all industries.
Cybersecurity, cloud security, and enterprise security of the modern organization share much in common, yet also call for a diverse range of skills, capabilities, and experience in order to meet the requirements of security-conscious customers. Decades of experience in developing, orchestrating, and delivering solutions across these three domains give us the vision and the confidence to provide solutions that empower and protect the enterprise at an integrated, holistic level. Our experience in addressing challenges in one area of an enterprise helps us meet requirements in others. We understand that a range of complementary capabilities may be needed to solve a single challenge, and we also recognize when a single solution might address multiple challenges. Our security solutions span across these three domains: Cybersecurity, Cloud Security and Enterprise Security.
Business Segments
We conduct our business through two reportable and operating segments: Security Solutions and Secure Networks. These segments enable the alignment of our strategies and objectives and provide a framework for the timely and rational allocation of resources within the line of business.
Additional information regarding our segments is presented in Note 21 - Segment Information to the consolidated financial statements at Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Security Solutions Segment:
The Security Solutions segment focuses on cybersecurity, cloud, and identity solutions. Cybersecurity solutions help our customers ensure the ongoing security, integrity and compliance of their on-premises and related cloud-based systems by reducing threats and vulnerabilities to foil cyber adversaries before they can attack. Our security engineers and subject matter experts assess our customers' cybersecurity environments and design, engineer, and operate systems needed to strengthen their cybersecurity postures. Our cloud solutions leverage the specialized skills and experience needed to help our customers plan, engineer, execute, and accelerate secure cloud migrations while assuring ongoing management and security of enterprise cloud technology environments. Our identity solutions deliver digital identity, biometric, and nationwide enrollment services and address Know Your Customer and identity management challenges for enterprises working within regulated and critical infrastructure environments. Security Solutions represented 55.5%, 51.0% and 65.2% of total revenues for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
•Information Assurance:
◦Xacta®: a premier platform for enterprise cyber risk management and security compliance automation, delivering security awareness for systems in the cloud, on-premises, and in hybrid and multi-cloud environments. Xacta delivers automated cyber risk and compliance management solutions to large commercial and government enterprises. Across the United States ("U.S.") federal government, Xacta is the de facto commercial cyber risk and compliance management solution. With use cases including cyber risk management, risk remediation management, security authorization, compliance management, audit management, inventory management, vulnerability management, continuous compliance monitoring, and vendor and supply chain risk management, Xacta administers the key elements of more than 100 leading regulations and policies for IT security compliance, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology ("NIST") Risk Management Framework ("RMF"), RMF for Department of Defense ("DoD") IT, Committee of National Security Systems 1253, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program ("FedRAMP") and the DoD's Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification ("CMMC") program.
◦Cybersecurity services: proven solutions and services for the full cybersecurity lifecycle, including consulting services, assessment and compliance, engineering and evaluation, operations, and penetration testing. With a pedigree in information and cybersecurity that spans three decades, our certified personnel provide services and solutions that deliver continuous security assurance for business, government, and critical infrastructure.
•Secure Communications:
◦Telos Ghost®: a virtual obfuscation network-as-a-service with encryption and managed attribution capabilities to ensure the safety and privacy of people, information, and resources on the network. Telos Ghost seeks to eliminate cyberattack surfaces by obfuscating and encrypting data, masking user identity and location, and hiding network resources. It provides the additional layers of security and privacy needed for intelligence gathering, cyber threat protection, securing critical infrastructure, and protecting communications and applications when a single error in security can jeopardize operations, property, and even lives. Telos Ghost is currently used by DoD, the Intelligence Community ("IC") and commercial organizations for a variety of highly sensitive applications, including cyber threat research, open-source intelligence, supply chain security vulnerability assessment, worldwide investigative and recovery services, and hiding critical assets.
◦Telos Automated Message Handling System ("AMHS"): web-based organizational message distribution and management for mission-critical communications; the recognized gold standard for organizational messaging in the U.S. government. Telos AMHS is used by military field operatives for critical communications on the battlefield using the Defense Information System Agency's Organizational Messaging Service and its specialized communications protocols. Telos AMHS is also used by the intelligence community for timely situational awareness and assessment reporting utilizing the Director of National Intelligence's Information Transport Service, Organizational Messaging data standards and computing infrastructure. Because Telos AMHS supports timely and reliable delivery for authoritative communications, its uses include terrorist warnings, "eyes-only" messages, military execution orders, intelligence information, overflight clearances, and Emergency Action Messages for nuclear command and control. Information exchanged at this level and for these purposes requires operational requirements for time-sensitive, guaranteed delivery, precedence, high availability, and reliability.
◦Telos Advanced Cyber Analytics ("ACA"): a solution-as-a-service that delivers timely, accurate, actionable intelligence at speed and scale to illuminate threats to enterprise assets. It enables organizations to detect malicious activity earlier and to uncover and identify previously unknown attacks and new malicious behavior. Further, it assists in attributing events and provides sophisticated and comprehensive analytics without expensive overhead. With fully automated external data collection and assessment, Telos ACA determines patterns of behavior exhibited by threat actors, and provides the necessary information to reduce vulnerabilities within the IT infrastructure before attackers can exploit them.
•Digital Identity Solutions:
◦IDTrust360®: an enterprise-class digital trusted identity risk platform for extending flexible hybrid cloud identity services. This platform is enabled for mobile, enterprise environments and custom digital identity services that mitigate threats by integrating advanced technologies that fuse biometrics, credentials, and other identity-centric data used to continuously monitor trust. IDTrust360 is the only commercially owned and operated platform on the market with direct interfaces to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's ("FBI") criminal records, Department of Homeland Security's ("DHS") terrorist watch list service, U.S. Department of Treasury's pay.gov, other government identity risk management systems, and numerous commercial identity, intelligence, and risk-based data sources. We are actively engaged with federal customers to integrate vital event records, government identification document records, and other fingerprint-based biometric records hosted across multiple agencies. This enables Telos to offer NIST-compliant digital identity services aligned with federal security mandates.
◦ONYX®: the world's first, most widely deployed, and most accurate touchless fingerprint biometric for mobile devices. Powered by state-of-the-art machine learning, ONYX eases deployment in a variety of industries, including financial services and healthcare, and applications, like consumer authentication and physical access and security. Acquired by Telos in 2021, the patented and award-winning ONYX solution delivers touchless fingerprint biometrics that people can submit simply by using their mobile phones. In June 2022, ONYX won first place in the overall competition of the Mobile Fingerprint Information Technology Challenge hosted by the NIST.
We maintain government certifications and designations that distinguish Telos ID, including TSA PreCheck® enrollment provider, Designated Aviation Channeling provider, FBI-approved Channeler, and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Electronic Fingerprint Submission provider.
Secure Networks Segment:
Secure Networks focuses on enterprise security. The Secure Networks segment provides secure networking architectures and solutions to the U.S. DoD, the federal IC, and other federal governmental agencies. Our net-centric solutions enable collaboration and connectivity to increase efficiency, reduce costs, and improve mission outcomes. Telos provides an extensive range of wired and wireless, fixed and deployable, classified and unclassified voice, data, and video secure network solutions and services to support defense and civilian missions.

Telos network engineers, security specialists, and program managers are experienced with advanced DoD and federal networks and are certified in the leading tools, technologies, and best practices for network management and administration. We ensure the consistency and continuity of network management services required in today's mission-critical network environments.
Key Customers
Our customer base consists of the U.S. federal government, large commercial businesses, state and local governments, and international customers. Our consolidated revenues are largely attributable to prime contracts or to subcontracts with our contractors engaged in work for the U.S. government; with the remaining attributable to state, local and commercial markets.
Our federal government customers include the DoD, the Central Intelligence Agency and multiple other agencies within the IC, Defense Manpower Data Center, and multiple civilian agencies, including the DHS, the U.S. Department of State, the FBI, Department of Health and Human Services, and U.S. Census Bureau ("Census"). These customers have a number of subsidiary agencies that have separate budgets and procurement functions. Our contracts may be with the highest level of these agencies or with the subsidiary agencies of these customers.
Our commercial customers include leading enterprises such as Amazon.com, Inc., Zscaler and Salesforce.com, Inc.
Our security solutions are the product of the extensive labor investment in developing our intellectual property and highly sophisticated software technology. These investments helped us expand with commercial customers, and win additional contracts within the military, the IC and civilian government agencies. Once our security solutions are embedded in our customers' technology infrastructure, these customer relationships often expand and lead to us providing additional security solutions.
Our Growth Strategies
We are pursuing multiple strategies in order to grow the Company, in both our commercial and government business end markets. Our key strategies are:
•Broaden reach within the U.S. federal government. We have historically focused on the U.S. federal government and believe that we are an established leader in providing security solutions to federal agencies, including DoD and the IC. Nonetheless, we believe the U.S. federal government represents a significant growth opportunity, and we expect to continue to invest in products to serve additional customers in this vertical. For example, Xacta is included on DHS's Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation Approved Products List to provide federal agencies with innovative security tools, which we believe presents us with an excellent opportunity to pursue contracts with additional federal agencies. In addition, our platform is available for use in the AWS GovCloud (U.S.), Oracle and Azure Government. The Telos ACA offering is positioned to supply unique data sets to government agencies to allow them to better inform themselves as they defend and protect their networks and assets. Telos ACA is also positioned to provide government customers with specific, actionable and high-fidelity intelligence about malicious cyber activity targeted at their networks.
•Leverage our diverse security solutions to expand our presence in commercial markets. Our offerings are designed to have broad applications and include security risk and compliance, secure messaging, identity vetting, and managed attribution and obfuscation. We believe that we are well-positioned to sell our capabilities into a dynamic and growing commercial opportunity set and to innovate to address emerging and unique requirements. For example, we have leveraged core Xacta functionality to meet the needs of large financial services and customer relationship management firms. We have also leveraged our U.S. federal government identity management qualifications to improve the speed and accuracy of vetting results for more than 100 airports, air carriers, and general aviation across the country. We intend to continue innovating and are developing additional offerings for cloud, mobile, and internet of things ("IoT") devices.
•Grow our revenue and expand margins with robust sales channels. We have formed a sales organization with a vertical sales component functioning as the direct channel to a wider account universe comprised of commercial and government customers. This vertical is focused on quick-turn, transactional sales. We continue expanding our partner program to include a variety of channels, including resellers, integrators, and contract partners to help us gain access to new markets more quickly. For example, both Telos Ghost and Xacta are now available through various AWS and Microsoft Azure marketplaces, serving markets requiring varying levels of security. The growth of our sales team and the accelerated expansion of these channel partner initiatives are anticipated to drive revenue growth and material gross margin expansion over time.
•Target and replace inefficient legacy products. Recognizing the limitations of their legacy systems, organizations are replacing existing systems and processes with Telos solutions. For example, Telos AMHS is a web-centric system that replaced legacy capabilities like communications centers for the purpose of executing operational orders (through organizational messaging) across the U.S. federal government and around the world. Xacta has disrupted the cyber risk and compliance management business across the U.S. federal government, replacing tedious manual activity with automation and delivering that automation to meet our customer's needs flexibly on premises, in hybrid environments, in the cloud, and across multi-cloud infrastructures.
•Pursue strategic acquisition opportunities. We believe that our markets remain fragmented, with many niche players providing limited product solutions targeting narrow customer segments. Given the breadth of our solution set and our customer end markets, we believe that we are well-positioned to opportunistically acquire smaller companies and incorporate their technology or deploy their solutions across a larger customer set. We believe that a targeted and opportunistic acquisition strategy will be a force multiplier for our organic growth opportunity.
Sales and Marketing
As part of the sales and channel program investments, we are also making corporate investments in functional areas such as contracts, solution architects, lead generation tools, and operations to ensure our back-office systems and processes scale for business growth. We are adding commission incentivized, sales personnel aligned to market segments focused on commercial industry and whitespace U.S. federal, IC and DOD market areas. We are concentrated on Xacta and Telos Ghost sales efforts in the financial services, insurance, healthcare, energy, and other highly regulated critical infrastructure markets.
We have expanded our sales capability for markets in which we are well known, such as the U.S. government, certain critical infrastructure sectors, and certain commercial verticals such as healthcare and financial services.
We built a dedicated channel team to include the launch of the Telos CyberProtect Partner Program. This ecosystem includes a variety of partner types including distributors (such as DLT, a tech data company), resellers, referral partners, technology integration partners, managed service providers, consulting partners and more. Collectively these partners help us deliver access to verticals such as healthcare, state, local government and education, and commercial enterprises, and bolster our position in the federal, IC and defense market.
We experienced success with the channel as we had several deals transact through the system in 2022 and 2021, allowing us to pressure test the operational side of the channel. Additionally, through our channel partners, Telos was successfully added to contract vehicles that provide access to a broader base of customers in our target markets.
Customer acquisition often involves extensive interaction at all levels of an organizations, from executives, to decision makers, to end users. We seek to forge relationships throughout an organization in an effort to obtain broad consensus as part of the sales process. We leverage the full power of Telos (executives, sales and channel partners) to gain access and build our brand awareness.
Our sales strategy is to establish a customer foothold with one of our solutions and work to achieve rapid success. We then leverage this customer relationship to generate interest in other solutions from the Telos portfolio. We have a variety of upsell opportunities that allow us to expand our presence within a customer account. For example, there are various complementary Xacta features that build on each other and are sold separately.
Much of our business is awarded through the submission of formal competitive bids, however, a significant portion of our revenue is awarded through limited competition or sole-source contracts.
Partner Organizations
Our sales team works with partner organizations like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle to pursue mutual customers and leverage their marketplace platforms and marketing programs. Last year, Telos announced a collaboration with IBM Security as part of IBM's Active Governance Services, which allows enterprises to operationalize and automate activities and solve challenges in cybersecurity compliance and regulatory risks. The solution combines IBM's world-class expertise in cyber compliance and governance programs with Telos' Xacta IT risk management platform to automate the time-consuming aspects of compliance and audit activities such as control selection, validation, reporting, and monitoring.
Marketing
We build market awareness of Telos and our solutions through a variety of marketing programs, including regular briefings with industry analysts, public relations activities, government relations initiatives, web seminars, trade show exhibitions, speaking engagements, and website marketing. We are making additional investments in these types of activities and targeting additional vertical-specific content creation, targeted advertising and brand awareness campaigns, social media campaigns, and search engine marketing.
Our sales team works hand in hand with our marketing team and various subject matter experts to develop targeted awareness campaigns for our various solutions that generate valuable leads and contacts.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had 738 employees, of whom approximately 90.4% are located in the United States. Approximately 413 of our U.S.-based employees held U.S. security clearances, and 23% self-identify as veterans of U.S. military service. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider relations with our employees to be good.
Our people are proficient in many fields, such as computer science, information security and vulnerability testing, networking technologies, physics, engineering, operations research, mathematics, economics, and business administration. We place a high value on our people. As a result, we seek to remain competitive in terms of salary structures, incentive compensation programs, fringe benefits, opportunities for growth, and individual recognition and award programs.
Our management team is committed to maintaining a corporate culture that fosters mutual respect and job satisfaction for our people while delivering innovation and value to customers and shareholders. This commitment is reflected in our core values:
Always with integrity, at Telos we:
Build trusted relationships,
Work hard together,
Design and deliver superior solutions, and
Have fun doing it.
These values are woven throughout the fabric of Telos. They are reflected in our hiring practices, reinforced regularly, and reviewed during appraisals. Employees are encouraged to challenge themselves and each other to exhibit the core values in all activities.
Our employees are given avenues of communication and interaction should they observe activities inconsistent with our core values. While employees are encouraged first to speak openly about any issues, a 24/7 hotline provides an opportunity to express concerns anonymously.
We consider the foundational value of integrity to be a non-negotiable requirement of employment, and an expectation of suppliers, partners, and our customers. We guard our reputation and will take action to protect it. An essential part of our brand promise is to always to engage employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and investors with integrity.
Diversity and Inclusion
We value diversity and inclusion and are committed to providing a work environment that is free of discrimination and harassment, where our employees can do their best work, bring their whole self to work, feel supported and in turn support others. We strive to create a working environment where everyone feels included and respected and has an equal opportunity to contribute. We believe that diverse teams maximize their potential and bring with them varied views, experiences, and perspectives. While we believe that our employee population is gender and ethnically diverse for our industry and operating markets, with approximately 27% of our global population self-identifying as female and approximately 29% self-identifying as underrepresented minorities, our objective is to continue to improve our hiring, development, training, advancement, and retention of diverse talent and to foster an inclusive environment at Telos.
Seasonality
We generally experience seasonality due to the fiscal year ends and procurement cycles of our key customers. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the U.S. government whose fiscal year ends on September 30 of each year, which may favorably impact our third fiscal quarter. In addition, our quarterly results may be impacted by the number of working days in a given quarter. See "Risk Factors — We are subject to the seasonality of U.S. government spending."
Research and Development
We developed proprietary software-based solutions in various platforms related to security and cyber risk management. We invest substantial resources in research and development to innovate new solutions, enhance our offerings and grow opportunities by developing new features and modules for our existing platforms. We are committed to and view our continued investment in research and development as a key factor to our long-term business success.
Government Contracts and Regulation
Our business is heavily regulated and we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government and other contracts. U.S. government contracts generally are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation ("FAR"), which sets forth policies, procedures and requirements for acquiring goods and services by the U.S. government, and agency-specific regulations that implement or supplement the FAR. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various procurement, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination, and adjustments and audit requirements. These laws and regulations, among other things:
•Impose specific and unique cost accounting practices that may differ from Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP" or "GAAP") and therefore require reconciliation;
•Define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under various cost-type U.S. government contracts;
•Require compliance with U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards;
•Require reviews by the Defense Contract Audit Agency ("DCAA"), Defense Contract Management Agency and other U.S. government agencies for compliance with government requirements for a contractor's business system;
•Restrict the use and dissemination of and require the protection of unclassified contract-related information and information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products and technical data;
•Impose acquisition regulations that define reimbursable and non-reimbursable costs; and
•Restrict the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products and technical data.
U.S. government customers employ several contracting methods to purchase services and products. Budgetary pressures and reforms in the procurement process have caused many U.S. government customers to increasingly purchase services and products using contracting methods that allow them to select multiple contract winners or pre-qualify certain contractors to provide services or products on established general terms and conditions rather than through single-award contracts. The predominant contracting methods through which U.S. government agencies procure services and products include definitive award contracts, indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity ("IDIQ") contracts, U.S. General Service Administration ("GSA") schedule contracts and other transactional agreements ("OTA").
Government contracts are subject to congressional funding. Consequently, at the outset of a program, a contract is usually partially funded, and Congress annually determines if additional funds are to be appropriated to the contract. All of our government customers have the right to terminate their contract with us at their convenience or in the event that we default. Most of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed where the U.S. government issues a termination for convenience.
A portion of our business is classified by the U.S. government and cannot be specifically described. The operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated financial statements.
These regulations and risks are described in more detail below under "Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
COVID-19 Pandemic
We continue to monitor and address the coronavirus pandemic ("COVID-19") closely, including the impact on us, our employees, our customers, our suppliers and our communities. We continue to consider guidance from the Centers for Disease Control ("CDC"), other health organizations, federal, state and local governmental authorities, and our customers, among others. We have taken, and continue to take, robust actions to help protect our employees' health, safety and well-being, support our suppliers and local communities, and to continue to serve our customers. Our goals have been to lessen the immediate potential adverse impacts, both health and economic, and to continue to position the Company for long-term success. Like the communities we serve, our actions have varied depending on the spread of COVID-19 and local health requirements and guidance from the CDC, the needs of our employees and the needs of our business.
With much of the business of government still being conducted by federal employees working remotely through the use of information technology systems, we believe there will continue to be a need on the part of the government for the types of solutions and services provided by Telos.
Our employees, suppliers and customers, the Company and our global community are facing tremendous challenges as a result of the pandemic and its resulting economic impacts, and we cannot predict how this dynamic situation will evolve or the impact it will have on the Company. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors" for discussion of risk related to our business and operations.
Environmental, Social and Governance Matters
We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. In addition, our operations may become subject to future laws and regulations, including those related to climate change and environmental sustainability. Although we do not currently anticipate that the costs of complying with, or the liabilities associated with, environmental laws will materially and adversely affect us, we cannot ensure that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in the future. The Company publicly reports certain climate change-related information via CDP and formed an Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") task force to address ESG matters. The Board of Directors authorized the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to oversee the Company's ESG efforts, which includes climate-related risks and opportunities.
See Item 1A, "Risk Factors", for discussion of risks related to our global climate-related risks and ESG matters.
