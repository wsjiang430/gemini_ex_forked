ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”), references to the “Company” and to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Yotta Acquisition Corporation.
 
Overview
 
We are a blank check company formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this report as our initial business combination. Our efforts to identify a target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region, although we intend to focus on high technology, blockchain, software and hardware, ecommerce, social media and other general business industries globally.
 
On April 22, 2022, we consummated our initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 10,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Common Stock”), and one redeemable warrant (the “Warrant”) entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, and one right (“Right”) to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of Common Stock upon the consummation of an initial business combination. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $100,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of 313,500 units (the “Private Units”) to Yotta Investment LLC (the “Sponsor”). The Private Shares are identical to the Units sold in the IPO except with respect to certain registration rights and transfer restrictions. The holders of the Private Units have agreed (A) to vote their insider shares, private shares underlying the Private Units (the “Private Shares”) and any public shares acquired by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (B) not to propose, or vote in favor of, an amendment to our certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 9 months (or up to 15 months, if we extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this report) from the closing of the IPO, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, (C) not to redeem any shares (including the private shares) to receive cash from the trust account in connection with a stockholder vote to approve our proposed initial business combination (or sell any shares they hold to us in a tender offer in connection with a proposed initial business combination) or a vote to amend the provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 9 months (or up to 15 months, if we extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this report) from the closing of the IPO, and (D) that the private shares shall not be entitled to be redeemed for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account if a business combination is not consummated.
 
In connection with the IPO, the underwriters were granted an option to purchase up to 1,150,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any (the “Over-allotment Option”). On April 25, 2022, the underwriters fully exercised the Over-allotment Option, and April 27, 2022, the underwriters purchased 1,150,000 Units (the “Option Units”) generating gross proceeds of $11,500,000. Simultaneously with the issuance and sale of the Option Units, the Company completed the Private Placement sale of 30,000 Private Units at a purchase price of $10.00 per unit (the “Additional Private Units”), generating total proceeds of $300,000 (the “Private Placement Proceeds”).
 
As a result, a total of $115,000,000 of the net proceeds from the sale of Units in the IPO (including the Over-allotment Option) and the Private Units (including the Option Units) were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public stockholders maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, acting as trustee. None of the funds held in trust will be released from the trust account, other than interest income to pay any tax obligations, until the earlier of the completion of an initial business combination within the required time period or our entry into liquidation if we have not completed a business combination in the required time period. On June 27, 2022, our common stock, warrants and rights underlying the Units sold in our IPO began to trade separately on a voluntary basis.

Business Combination Agreement
 
On October 24, 2022, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement (the “Agreement”) by and among NaturalShrimp Incorporated, a Nevada corporation (the “Target”), the Company, and Yotta Merger Sub, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Merger Sub”) and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Target (the “Business Combination”) with the Target as the surviving corporation of the Business Combination and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In connection with the Business Combination, the Company will change its name to “NaturalShrimp, Incorporated” or such other name designated by the Target by notice to the Company. At the closing of the Business Combination, the Company will issue 17.5 million shares of Common Stock, to the former security holders of the Target. Following the closing of the Business Combination, the former securityholders of the Target will be entitled to receive up to 10,000,000 additional shares of Common Stock if, following the closing of the Business Combination, the Target meets or exceeds either of two annual revenue thresholds for each of the fiscal years ending on March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025. After the closing of the Business Combination, if the Company meets or exceeds $15,000,000 in revenue (per its audited financial statements) for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, then the Company will issue 5,000,000 shares of Common Stock to the former securityholders of the Target. If the Company meets or exceeds $30,000,000 in revenue (per its audited financial statements) for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025, then the Company will issue 5,000,000 shares of Common Stock to the former securityholders of the Target.
 
In the event the Company or the Target validly terminates the Agreement because of a default by the other, a breakup fee of $3.0 million will be due to the terminating party.
 
Extensions of Time Period to Complete a Business Combination and Outstanding Promissory Notes
 
On January 20, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of $575,000 to our Sponsor in exchange for its depositing such amount into the Company’s trust account in order to extend the amount of time it has available to complete a business combination from January 22, 2023 to April 22, 2023. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Target paid one-half of the extension fee while the Company paid the other half.
 
On February 5, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of $250,000 to our Sponsor in exchange for its depositing such amount into the Company’s operating account in order to meet the working capital needs of the company. The note does not bear interest and matures upon the closing of a business combination by the Company.
 
Initial Business Combination
 
General
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any substantive commercial business until we complete a business combination. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of the IPO and the private placement of Private Units, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these in effecting our initial business combination.

Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination
 
Subject to our management team’s fiduciary duties and the limitation that one or more target businesses have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting discounts and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described below in more detail, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. Additionally, there is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. We have not established any specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses.
 
To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stage of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. The valuation of a financially unstable company or early stage company can be more complicated than the calculation of a mature, stable company, and any valuation we make on such a company would be based, in part, on its prospects and how successful we believe the business will be once the company matures or is stabilized. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we may not properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
Fair Market Value of Target Business
 
Pursuant to Nasdaq listing rules, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses having an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the funds in the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting discounts and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account), which we refer to as the 80% test, at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, although we may structure a business combination with one or more target businesses whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the trust account balance. If we are no longer listed on Nasdaq, we will not be required to satisfy the 80% test.

Lack of Business Diversification
 
For an indefinite period of time after consummation of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By consummating our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target Business’ Management Team
 
Although we scrutinized the management team of our target business, our assessment of the target business’ management team may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management team may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following our initial business combination remains to be determined. While it is possible that some of our key personnel will remain associated in senior management or advisory positions with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that they will devote their full time efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the company after the consummation of our initial business combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. While the personal and financial interests of our key personnel may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, their ability to remain with the company after the consummation of our initial business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. Additionally, our officers and directors may not have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
 
Following our initial business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We may not have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we have encountered and will continue to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination, and our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination.

Facilities
 
We currently maintain our principal executive offices at 1185 Avenue of the Americas, Suite 301, New York, NY 10036. The cost for this space is $10,000 per month, which will be paid to Yotta Investment LLC. We consider our current office space, combined with the other office space otherwise available to our executive officers, adequate for our current operations.
Employees
 
We have two executive officers. They are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business (which could range from only a few hours a week to a majority of their time). We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements
 
We have registered our units, common stock, warrants and rights under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual report will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
 
We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of any proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with or reconciled to United States GAAP or IFRS as issued by the IASB. A particular target business identified by us as a potential business combination candidate may not have the necessary financial statements. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination with the proposed target business.
 
We will be required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to have our internal control over financial reporting audited for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding the adequacy of their internal control over financial reporting. The development of the internal control over financial reporting of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such initial business combination.
 
We are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act and will remain such for up to five years. However, if our non-convertible debt issued within a three-year period or our total revenues exceed $1.07 billion or the market value of our shares of common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year. As an emerging growth company, we have elected, under Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
 
Potential Conflicts
 
Members of our management team who directly or indirectly own our securities may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.

Our officers and directors have agreed to present to us all target business opportunities that have a fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account, subject to any fiduciary or contractual obligations they may have. As more fully discussed in “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance — Conflicts of Interest,” if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an initial business combination opportunity that might be attractive to any entity to which he has fiduciary or contractual obligations, he may be required to present such initial business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such initial business combination opportunity to us. For more information on the relevant pre-existing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our management team, see the section titled “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance — Conflicts of Interest.”
 
Legal Proceedings
 
There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our management team in their capacity as such.
