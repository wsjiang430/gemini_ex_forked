ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Astronics Corporation (“Astronics” or the “Company”) is a leading provider of advanced technologies to the global aerospace, defense and electronics industries. Our products and services include advanced, high-performance electrical power generation, distribution and seat motion systems, lighting and safety systems, avionics products, systems and certification, aircraft structures and automated test systems.
We have principal operations in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada, France and England, as well as engineering offices in the Ukraine and India. The operation in Ukraine is a small engineering office and we have not experienced any significant disruption in staffing or services as a result of the Ukrainian and Russian conflict. 
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted businesses on a global scale, led to significant volatility in financial markets and affected the aviation and industrial industries. The impacts of the pandemic have placed labor and supply chain pressures on our business and we have been impacted by customer demand variability. Although we saw stable and growing backlog during 2022 in our aerospace business, COVID-19 related disruptions are ongoing and continue to adversely challenge our markets. While we remain bullish about the aerospace business, we believe the recovery to pre-pandemic activity, particularly in the widebody market, will take longer than originally anticipated at the outset of the pandemic. As economic activity continues to recover, we will continue to monitor the situation, assessing further possible implications on our operations, supply chain, liquidity, cash flow and customer orders.
See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, for an additional discussion of risk related to supply chain disruptions.
In September 2021 the Company was awarded a grant of up to $14.7 million from the U.S. Department of Transportation under the Aviation Manufacturing Jobs Protection Program (“AMJP”). The Company received $7.4 million under the grant in 2021, $5.2 million in the first quarter of 2022 and $2.1 million in the third quarter of 2022. The grant benefit was recognized ratably over the six-month performance period as a reduction to cost of products sold in proportion to the compensation expense that the award is intended to defray. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized $6.0 million and $8.7 million of the award, respectively. 
Additionally, the Company qualified for government subsidies from the Canadian and French governments as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on our foreign operations. The Canadian and French subsidies are income-based grants intended to reimburse the Company for certain employee wages. The grants are recognized as income over the periods in which the Company recognizes as expenses the costs the grants are intended to defray. The amounts recognized during 2022 were immaterial.
For additional details regarding the subsidies and grants, and their impact on consolidated results of operations and financial position, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this report. 
Refinancing
On January 19, 2023, the Company completed a financing transaction totaling $205 million, which refinanced its previous revolving credit facility which was scheduled to mature in November 2023. The new financing consists of a $90 million asset-based term loan (the “Term Loan Facility”) and a $115 million asset-based revolving credit facility (the “ABL Revolving Credit Facility”). The Term Loan Facility requires monthly amortization beginning in April 2023, bears interest at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus 8.75%, is collateralized by real estate, fixed assets and intellectual property, and is scheduled to mature on the earlier of the maturity of the ABL Revolving Credit Facility or January 19, 2027. The ABL Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at SOFR plus between 2.25% and 2.75%, is collateralized by certain domestic accounts receivable and inventory, and is scheduled to mature on January 19, 2026. For additional information, see discussion in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 8, Long-Term Debt, of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this report.
Divestitures
On February 13, 2019, the Company completed a divestiture of its semiconductor test business within the Test Systems segment. The total proceeds of the divestiture included two elements of contingent purchase consideration (“earnout”). In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company agreed to an earnout payment of $10.7 million for the calendar 2020 earnout, which was 
recorded in 2021 as a separate line item below operating loss and was received by the Company in early January 2022. In March 2022, the Company agreed with the earnout calculation for the calendar 2021 earnout in the amount of $11.3 million. The Company recorded the gain and received the payment in the first quarter of 2022. In February 2023, the Company was notified by the buyer that they have calculated $3.4 million as being payable for the calendar 2022 earnout. The Company is in the process of reviewing the calculation and expects to record the additional gain on sale, and receive the payment, in the first quarter of 2023. We are not eligible for any further earnout payments related to this divestiture. For further information, see Note 21 in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this report.
On October 6, 2021, the Company sold one of its Aerospace buildings for $9.2 million. Net cash proceeds were approximately $8.8 million and a gain on sale of approximately $5.0 million was recorded. The operation has been integrated into another facility.
Products and Customers
Our Aerospace segment designs and manufactures products for the global aerospace industry. Product lines include lighting and safety systems, electrical power generation, distribution and seat motion systems, aircraft structures, avionics products, systems certification, and other products. Our Aerospace customers are the airframe manufacturers (“OEM”) that build aircraft for the commercial transport, military and general aviation markets, suppliers to those OEMs, aircraft operators such as airlines, suppliers to the aircraft operators, and branches of the U.S. Department of Defense. During 2022, this segment’s sales were divided 68% to the commercial transport market, 12% to the military aircraft market, 14% to the general aviation market and 6% to other markets. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its adverse impact on air travel worldwide, the commercial aerospace industry has been significantly disrupted. Most of this segment’s sales are a result of contracts or purchase orders received from customers, placed on a day-to-day basis or for single year procurements rather than long-term multi-year contract commitments. On occasion, the Company does receive contractual commitments or blanket purchase orders from our customers covering multiple-year deliveries of hardware to our customers.
Our Test Systems segment designs, develops, manufactures and maintains automated test systems that support the aerospace and defense, communications and mass transit industries as well as training and simulation devices for both commercial and military applications. In the Test Systems segment, Astronics’ products are sold to a global customer base including OEMs and prime government contractors for both electronics and military products. The nature of our Test Systems business is such that it pursues large, often multi-year, projects.
Sales by segment, geographic region, major customer and foreign operations are provided in Note 20 in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this report.
We have historically had a significant concentration of business with two major customers; Panasonic Avionics Corporation (“Panasonic”) and The Boeing Company (“Boeing”). Sales to Panasonic accounted for less than 10% of sales in 2022 and 2021, and 11.1% of sales in 2020. Sales to Boeing accounted for 11.0% of sales in 2022, 10.0% of sales in 2021, and less than 10% of sales in 2020. Sales to Panasonic and Boeing are primarily in the Aerospace segment. 
Strategy
Our strategy is to increase our value by developing technologies and capabilities either internally or through acquisition, and use those capabilities to provide innovative solutions to our targeted markets where our technology can be beneficial.
Practices as to Maintaining Working Capital
Liquidity is discussed in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this report.
Competitive Conditions
We experience considerable competition in the market sectors we serve, principally with respect to product performance and price, from various competitors, many of which are substantially larger and have greater resources than we do. Success in the markets we serve depends upon product innovation, customer support, responsiveness and cost management. We continue to invest in developing the technologies and engineering support critical to competing in our markets.
Government Contracts
All U.S. government contracts, including subcontracts where the U.S. government is the ultimate customer, may be subject to termination at the election of the government. Our revenue stream relies on military spending. Approximately 11% of our 2022 consolidated sales were made to government-related markets.
Government Regulation
The Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) regulates the manufacture, repair and operation of all aircraft and aircraft parts operated in the United States. Its regulations are designed to ensure that all aircraft and aviation equipment are continuously maintained in proper condition to ensure safe operation of the aircraft. Similar rules apply in other countries. All aircraft must be maintained under a continuous condition monitoring program and must periodically undergo thorough inspection and maintenance. The inspection, maintenance and repair procedures for the various types of aircraft and equipment are prescribed by regulatory authorities and can be performed only by certified repair facilities utilizing certified technicians. Certification and conformance is required prior to installation of a part on an aircraft. Our operations may in the future be subject to new and more stringent regulatory requirements. In that regard, we closely monitor the FAA and industry trade groups in an attempt to understand how possible future regulations might impact us. Our businesses which sell products directly to the U.S. Government or for use in systems delivered to the U.S. Government can be subject to various laws and regulations governing pricing and other factors.
There has been no material adverse effect to our consolidated financial statements nor competitive positions as a result of these government regulations.
Raw Materials
Materials, supplies and components are purchased from numerous sources. We believe that the loss of any one source, although potentially disruptive in the short-term, would not materially affect our operations in the long-term. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted the global supply chain for certain components. See further discussion within the Risk Factor discussion in Item 1A.
Seasonality
Our business is typically not seasonal.
Backlog
At December 31, 2022, our consolidated backlog was $571.4 million. At December 31, 2021, our backlog was $415.7 million. The increase in backlog is driven primarily by recovering demand from our commercial transport and general aviation customers, with increased OEM build rates and increased spending by commercial airlines on fleet improvements.
Backlog in the Aerospace segment was $477.7 million at December 31, 2022, of which $402.4 million is expected to be recognized as revenue in 2023. Backlog in the Test Systems segment was $93.7 million at December 31, 2022. The Test Systems segment expects to recognize $49.0 million of this backlog as revenue in 2023. 
Patents
We have a number of patents. While the aggregate protection of these patents is of value, our only material business that is dependent upon the protection afforded by these patents is our cabin power distribution products. Our patents and patent applications relate to electroluminescence, instrument panels, cord reels and handsets, and a broad patent covering the cabin power distribution technology. We regard our expertise and techniques as proprietary and rely upon trade secret laws and contractual arrangements to protect our rights. We have trademark protection in our major markets.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include salaries, benefits, consulting, material costs and depreciation. Research and development expenses amounted to $48.3 million in 2022, $43.3 million in 2021 and $40.2 million in 2020. These costs are included in Cost of products sold.
Human Capital Resources
Human Capital Management and Corporate Culture
As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 2,400 employees, of whom approximately 2,000 were employed in the United States and approximately 400 were employed outside of the United States. We have approximately 110 hourly production employees at PECO who are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We also leverage temporary workers to provide flexibility for our business and manufacturing needs.
We greatly value our employees and recognize that, without them, the Company would not have achieved the success it has accomplished since inception. We strive to provide a positive, supportive work culture with a clear global vision and a collaborative work style. We strongly believe that a focus on learning and supporting career development can lead to success. Astronics Corporation regularly earns “best employer” awards. 
As it relates to customers, investors, suppliers and partners, our Company is dedicated to conducting business with integrity and responsibility for the greater good. We promote honest and ethical conduct, compliance with applicable government regulations and accountability by all of its directors, officers and employees.
When considering an acquisition or partnership, we embed questions specific to human capital management within our due diligence approach. These questions are in the areas of culture, equal employment opportunity, compliance with governing bodies, ethics, as well as employee benefits. We ask these in an effort to ensure that the acquisition candidate is a positive cultural fit and to minimize any risk when assessing the acquisition candidate.
In addition, our Corporate Governance Guidelines outline expectations that the Board establish and promote policies that encourage a positive, supportive work culture. The Board recognizes that culture is critical to the long-term success of Astronics and our strategy.
Compensation Programs and Employee Benefits
We believe that future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We provide employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth and a robust employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including;
•Health and dental insurance
•Generous paid time off
•401K, profit sharing, and bonus programs
•Flexible spending accounts
•Employee stock purchase plan
•Disability and life insurance
•Commute reduction, fitness, tuition programs
•Community service opportunities
The COVID-19 pandemic had a sudden and significant impact on the global economy, and particularly in the aerospace industry, causing us to make difficult cost conservation measures including workforce reductions activities to align capacity with expected demand as well as suspension of certain benefit programs. These measures were taken to maintain the financial health and liquidity of the business. We are continuously evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is dependent on future developments, including the duration of the pandemic and the its impact on the global economy and the aerospace industry, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. We have reinstituted all of the previously-suspended benefits.
Employee Engagement 
The lifeblood of any organization is its employee base. We rely on our individual subsidiaries to regularly gather employee feedback, using the method each subsidiary believes is most appropriate. In some instances that feedback is obtained through “Town Hall” formats; in other instances, it is obtained through surveys. We also expect our managers to solicit and, where applicable, use employee feedback to improve its business practices and working environment. We are proud to have received numerous awards, recognizing both product quality as well as the ability to provide an excellent work environment.
Diversity and Inclusion 
The Company believes that diversity and inclusion is critical for the attraction and retention of top talent, and employs policies and procedures to recruit women and minority talent as well as policies to ensure pay equality. Astronics has an Equal 
Employment Opportunity Policy whereby the Company commits to providing equal employment opportunity and affirmative action plans for all qualified employees and applicants without regard to race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, national origin, disability, veteran status, age, marital status, pregnancy, genetic information or other legally protected status. 
Health and Safety
Astronics is committed to the safety of our customers and our employees. Each Astronics operation maintains environmental, health and safety policies and practices that seek to promote the operation of its businesses in a manner that is protective of the health and safety of the public and its employees.
Our operations offer several health and welfare programs to employees to promote fitness and wellness and to encourage preventative healthcare. In addition, our employees are offered a confidential employee assistance program that provides professional counseling to employees and their family members. Also, many of our operations offer green space for employees to use during their breaks.
