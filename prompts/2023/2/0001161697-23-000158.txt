ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OUR BUSINESS
 
KORU Medical develops, manufactures and markets proprietary portable and innovative medical devices primarily for the subcutaneous drug delivery market as governed by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) quality and regulatory system and international standards for quality system management. Our focus is primarily concentrated on our mechanical infusion products, the FREEDOM Infusion Systems (which we refer to as the “FREEDOM System” when used with one or more accessories), which include the FREEDOM60® Syringe Driver, the FreedomEdge® Syringe Driver, HIgH-Flo Subcutaneous Safety Needle Sets™ and Precision Flow Rate Tubing™.
 
Our revenues are derived from three business sources: (i) domestic core, (ii) international core, and (iii) novel therapies. Our core domestic and international revenues consist of sales of our syringe drivers, tubing and needles (“Product Revenue”) for the delivery of subcutaneous drugs that are FDA cleared for use with the Freedom Infusion Systems, with the primary delivery for immunoglobulin to treat Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases (“PIDD”) and Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (“CIDP”). Novel therapies consist of Product Revenue for feasibility/clinical trials (pre-clinical studies, Phase I, Phase II, Phase III, ) of biopharmaceutical companies in the drug development process as well as non-recurring engineering services (“NRE”) revenues (including testing and registration services) received from biopharmaceutical companies to ready or customize the FREEDOM System for clinical and commercial use.
 
OUR MISSION
 
Our mission is to improve the quality of life of patients around the world by delivering innovative, effective, and easy-to-use drug delivery systems that can be used at home or alternate site settings, for patient self-administration of drug therapy.

OUR STRATEGY
 
We plan to become a leading provider of solutions for subcutaneous large-volume infusions defined as greater than 10ml. We intend to accomplish this objective by increasing penetration of our core subcutaneous immunoglobulin (“SCIg”) market and extending into new subcutaneous drug therapies.
 
We have identified multiple factors we believe are driving growth of the SCIg market. These include:
 

• | Increasing diagnoses of Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases (“PIDD”), which often require immunoglobulin (“Ig”) treatment 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | New on-label indications for SCIg drugs such as Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (“CIDP”), Secondary Immunodeficiency Diseases (“SIDD”), and others in clinical development. 
• | Increase in the number of available SCIg medications such as the introduction of Cutaquig® and Xembify® in the United States and Europe, and planned launches of Cuvitru® and HyQvia® in Japan
• | Biopharmaceutical investment in SCIg products, such as prefilled syringe formats that make infusion easier for patients, which may make more patients eligible for SCIg therapy 
• | Increasing supply of donated plasma, which increases the global supply of Ig medications 
• | Favorable patient preference, side effect profile, and health economics for at-home SCIg compared with intravenous Ig therapy 

 
We intend to maintain and extend our leadership position in the SCIg market through clinical and product innovation and commercial excellence. By improving our products, establishing thought leadership in subcutaneous therapy, partnering with drug manufacturers, expanding geographically, and executing commercially, we intend to increase our overall global share position and the number of patients prescribed SCIg over intravenous Ig.
 
Furthermore, we plan to expand into new therapies outside of SCIg. We estimate that at least 100 large-volume drugs are in clinical development utilizing subcutaneous infusion. The pipeline is driven by the need to deliver high therapeutic doses, difficulty in formulating large molecules into small volumes, nursing shortage, pharmaceutical companies shifting development programs toward at-home subcutaneous therapy, and other factors. Biopharmaceutical manufacturers seek device partners during the drug development process. We intend to partner with them during clinical development—generating services revenues to prepare and customize our products for clinical use and regulatory clearance, as well as, product revenues post commercialization.
 
We believe our track record of regulatory clearance and successful patient use, combined with our channel access, position KORU to both maximize our growth in the core SCIg market and expand into new therapeutic areas.
 
OUR PRODUCTS
 
KORU’s infusion devices work together as a system to deliver life-saving therapies to patients with chronic illnesses, such as PIDD and CIDP. The FREEDOM System comprises the FREEDOM60 Syringe Driver (standard 60/50ml syringe compatible) and FreedomEdge Syringe Driver (standard 30ml and 20ml syringe and prefilled syringe compatible), HIgH-Flo Subcutaneous Safety Needle Sets and Precision Flow Rate Tubing. The systems are portable, easy to operate, maintenance free and do not require batteries or electricity. The FREEDOM System operates at a lower pressure than an electrical, volumetric pump and maintains a balance between what a patient’s subcutaneous tissues can tolerate what the system delivers.
 
Our FREEDOM System is cleared for the most on-label subcutaneous indications including specific FDA clearance for: delivery of specific medications through subcutaneous and intravenous routes, including specific clearance for leading immune globulins Cutaquig ®, Cuvitru®, Hizentra®, Xembify, Empaveli® (branded Aspaveli® outside the United States), Gammagard Liquid®, and a variety of antibiotics. The FREEDOM System is the only infusion system specifically cleared for SCIg delivery with a prefilled syringe, the Hizentra® 20ml prefilled syringe.

Ambulatory infusion systems are most prevalent in the home care and alternate site markets. The SCIg products delivered by the FREEDOM System are indicated for a variety of conditions, including PIDD and CIDP in the United States and PIDD, CIDP and Secondary Immunodeficiency Disease (“SIDD”) in Europe. Empaveli® is indicated for Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (“PNH”). The use of the FREEDOM System for SCIg drug delivery continues to increase, and it remains the market leading delivery system in the U.S. for these treatments. In recent years Hizentra® has received an expanded indication for treatment of CIDP in the United States and multiple SCIg drugs have received indications for CIDP and SID outside of the United States. It is expected that patient access to SCIg will expand as new drugs are developed, existing drugs are approved and/or marketed in new countries, and existing drugs receive new indications.
 
HIgH-Flo Subcutaneous Safety Needle Sets are an important element of the FREEDOM System. The needle sets are available in 26- and 24-gauge sizes and feature unique design elements specific to subcutaneous self-administration. One such feature includes a back-cut needle designed for more comfort and less tissue damage with flexible wings to minimize patient discomfort over prior needle set offerings.
 
Precision Flow Rate Tubing is designed for repeatable flow rates without allowing unrestricted flow. The tubing regulates the flow rate and infusion time for various applications when used with the FREEDOM System. Each tubing set provides a different level of flow restriction and consistently delivers medication with low residual volume to minimize drug waste.
 
SALES AND DISTRIBUTION
 
The FREEDOM System is sold through both direct sales and medical device distributors to pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmacy customers and home infusion providers.  Our products are sold principally through a small number of distributors so our specialty pharmacy customers receive the benefit of remote inventory management and one-stop shopping.  We sell the majority of our products through three distributors in the U.S. and two distributors outside the U.S. As of December 31, 2022, these five distributors comprised approximately 72% of our net revenues with one of our U.S. distributors contributing approximately 41%.
 
Specialty pharmacies, home infusion providers, and distributors are our primary sales contacts, although we provide education and training materials to clinicians, patients and patient advocates both in the field and online.
 
MANUFACTURING AND RAW MATERIALS
 
We currently perform product assembly, calibration, pre- and post-assembly quality control inspection and testing, and final packaging at our Chester, NY facility and have been transitioning those activities to our leased facility in Mahwah, NJ. We expect to transition all remaining activities to Mahwah, NJ in March 2023. We have entered into an agreement with Command Medical Products, Inc. (“Command”), to manufacture and supply substantially all of the Company’s subassemblies, needle sets and tubing products for supply continuity and cost savings. We expect the transition to Command to be completed no later than the second quarter of 2023.
 
Our ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of components for our products. All of the components that go into the manufacturing of our products and accessories are sourced from third-party suppliers on a single source basis. The Company uses single-source suppliers in part due to governmental approval and validation requirements. A change in supplier, or the use of multiple suppliers of the same materials, often would necessitate additional approvals and validations, which the Company seeks to avoid unless and until the need arises. The Company does not have any contracts with suppliers that impose material binding obligations on the Company or provide the Company with any material rights or benefits, other than the agreement with Command.
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 
We recognize the importance of innovation to our long-term success and are committed to research and new product development activities. Our product development team along with outside engineering resources are engaged in continuously improving existing product performance and researching new product opportunities to enhance our product portfolio. We spent $5.0 million and $2.5 million on research and development for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We intend to make additional investments in research and development over the next twelve months to support adding research and development capability to develop a “next-generation” infusion pump and consumable system.

REGULATORY
 
Our medical devices and technologies, as well as our business activities, are subject to a complex set of regulations and rigorous enforcement, principally by the FDA, and numerous other federal, state, and non-U.S. governmental authorities. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of our products.
 
The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, approval, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, marketing, distribution, post approval monitoring and reporting, import and export of medical devices in the U.S. to assure the safety and effectiveness of medical products for their intended use. Thus, both before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under the FDA. For instance, all medical devices marketed in the U.S. must be manufactured in accordance with the FDA’s quality system regulations (“QSRs”). Accordingly, our facility and procedures and those of our applicable suppliers are also subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to determine compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Federal Trade Commission also regulates the advertising of our products. Further, we are subject to laws directed at preventing fraud and abuse, which subject our sales and marketing, training and other practices to government scrutiny.
 
Our business is also affected by patient privacy laws and government payor cost containment initiatives, as well as environmental health and safety laws and regulations.
 
U.S. Device Classification and Clearance
 
Except where an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require either a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”), also known as a 510(k) clearance, approval of a pre-market approval (“PMA”) application, or as part of a drug-device combination product through a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) or New Drug Application (“NDA”). For example, the use of our FREEDOM System with therapies not covered by the existing FDA clearance will require additional 510(k) clearance , BLA, NDA or PMA approval.
 
Under the 510(k) process, applicants must demonstrate to the FDA that a device is as safe and effective as, or substantially equivalent to, a legally marketed device, known as the “predicate” device. Applicants must submit performance data to establish substantial equivalence. In some instances, data from human clinical trials must also be submitted in support of a 510(k), and this data must be collected in a manner that conforms to the applicable Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) regulations. The FDA must issue a substantial equivalence determination before commercial distribution can occur. Changes to cleared devices that will not significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device can generally be made without additional 510(k) submissions. Changes that will significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device will require a new 510(k) prior to marketing of the modified device. We cannot predict with any certainty how future reforms to Federal regulations may impact our business. See “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.”
 
Under the PMA application process, the applicant must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. This approval process applies to most Class III devices, and generally requires clinical data to support the safety and effectiveness of the device, obtained in conformance with IDE regulations. The FDA will approve a PMA application if it finds that there is a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended purpose, and that the proposed manufacturing is in compliance with the QSRs. For novel technologies, the FDA will seek input from an advisory panel of medical experts regarding the safety and effectiveness of, and their benefit-risk analysis for the device. The PMA process is generally more detailed, lengthier and more expensive than the 510(k) process, though both processes can be expensive and lengthy, and requires payment of significant user fees, unless an exemption is available.
 
Under the NDA and BLA application process, the applicant must demonstrate that the drug or drug-device combination is safe and effective for its intended use. Various FDA reviewers will provide written evaluations in their areas of expertise which are consolidated and provided to FDA senior staff for final evaluation. FDA then provides the application sponsor approval or a deficiency letter. In the case of a deficiency letter, the sponsor must submit an adequate response to continue the review process. The NDA and BLA processes involve considerable expense associated with data collection and analysis and other expenses.
 
We are also required to comply with the regulations of every other country where we commercialize products before we can launch or maintain new products on the market. Many countries that previously did not have medical device regulations, or had minimal regulations, are now introducing them.
 
- 4 -


International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. Additionally, exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries, medical devices are regulated. Frequently, regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the U.S. due to differing regulatory requirements; however, other countries require approval in the country of origin first. Most countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis, generally every five years. The recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and, where needed, conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where recertification applications are required, they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries.
 
Post-Approval Regulation
 
Even after a device is cleared or approved by FDA for marketing, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. The FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies and competent authorities actively monitor compliance to local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices, record-keeping, reporting of adverse events, labeling and promotional practices. The FDA can ban certain medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order repair, replacement or refund of these devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the FFDCA and the Safe Medical Devices Act pertaining to medical devices or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. In addition, FDA and other governmental agencies such as the Department of Justice can take action against a company that promotes “off-label” uses. Regulatory agencies and authorities in the countries where we do business can halt production in or distribution within their respective country or otherwise take action in accordance with local laws and regulations. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict a company from effectively marketing and selling its products, may limit a company’s ability to obtain future premarket clearances or approvals, and could result in a substantial modification to a company’s business practices and operations.
 
Manufacturing Regulation
 
We must also comply with FDA and foreign agency regulations governing medical device manufacturing practices.  The FDA and foreign agencies require manufacturers to register their establishments, and they monitor compliance with device manufacturing requirements through inspections of manufacturing facilities.  If an investigator observes conditions that might be violative, the manufacturer must correct those conditions or explain them satisfactorily or face potential regulatory action that might include physical removal of the product from the marketplace. We are an FDA-registered medical device manufacturer and must demonstrate that we comply with the FDA’s QSR and Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”).
 
We believe that our products and procedures are in compliance with all applicable FDA and international regulations.  There is no assurance, however, that other products we are developing or products that we may develop in the future will be cleared by the FDA and classified as Class II products, or that additional regulations restricting the sale of our present or proposed products will not be promulgated by the FDA or other foreign agencies.  In addition, changes in FDA, or other federal or state health, environmental or safety regulations or their applications could adversely affect our business.
 
Other Healthcare Laws
 
We are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. These laws include:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal third-party payors that are false or fraudulent. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act; 

 
- 5 -



• | the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any federal healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 
• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; 
• | the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) information related to payments or other “transfers of value” made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain health care professionals beginning in 2022, and teaching hospitals and ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members, and payments or other “transfers of value” to such physician owners; and 
• | analogous state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical and device companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require device manufacturers to track and report information related to payments and other “transfers of value” to physicians and other healthcare providers or pricing, marketing expenditures and information; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.

 
Violations of any of the laws described above include civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of an entity’s operations, the debarment, suspension or exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs and/or imprisonment.
 
Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Our profitability and operations are subject to changes in legislative, regulatory and reimbursement policies and decisions as well as changes in private payer reimbursement coverage and payment decisions and policies. Our products are purchased by specialty pharmacies and ambulatory service providers or hospitals that typically bill various third-party payors, such as governmental programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, and comparable non-U.S. programs), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services and products provided to their patients. The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate coverage and reimbursement for our products and the drugs they administer is critical because it affects which products customers purchase and the price they are willing to pay. Third-party payors are increasingly reducing coverage and reimbursement for certain healthcare services and products and challenging prices charged for healthcare services and products.
Environmental Health and Safety Laws
 
We are required to comply with federal, state, and local environmental laws; however, there is no significant effect of compliance on capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. We do not use significant amounts of hazardous materials in the assembly of our products.
COMPETITION AND THE MARKET
 
Competition for the FREEDOM System includes electronic (volumetric) pumps, elastomeric (infuser) pumps, and fully mechanical pumps as well as other types of pumps. Safety, ease of use, familiarity, cost effectiveness, and accuracy are the principal driving influencers of pump selection. Electronic pumps deliver drugs at a programmed flow rate. They are more costly and require electricity or batteries, extensive training and maintenance and must be programmed by a qualified pharmacist or clinician. Elastomeric pumps are one-time-use balloon type devices used for infusion of drugs in intravenous and surgical wound site applications. Pharmacies are required to fill them with drugs and deliver them to the patient. They are easy to use from the patient point of view but can be more costly and time consuming to fill, are temperature sensitive and have larger residual volumes than other delivery systems.
 
- 6 -


Competition for infusion devices for new drugs includes a variety of technologies and companies. No single technological approach—autoinjectors, electronic (volumetric pumps), mechanical pumps, needle-free injectors, on-body wearable devices, pen injectors, and pre-filled syringes—will meet the needs of all or even a majority of drugs. For drugs requiring infusion volumes over 3 ml, the segment most similar to the SCIg drugs currently delivered by the FREEDOM System, the most relevant approaches include mechanical pumps, on-body wearable devices, and simple electronic pumps. Challenges to their successful commercialization include high costs per infusion, increased environmental impact, complexity for users, and complex mechanisms with multiple failure modes.
 
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 85 full time employees and 1 part time employee. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 53% of the Company’s workforce was female and approximately 43% of the Company’s employees in managerial roles were female. Approximately 41% were minorities (non-White) in the Company workforce as of December 31, 2022. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement.
 
To help drive consistent execution of our business strategy, including our customer focused philosophy, and support their development, we provide training opportunities to our employees that align with their responsibilities over their career with us. We maintain a dedicated Internet-based learning platform with a broad portfolio of written, audio-visual and interactive enterprise-wide and discipline-specific policy and training materials. This platform includes a library of self-directed courses and virtual, instructor-led programs for employees at all levels of our organization. Managers and supervisors are provided training to help their employees progress in their professional development.
 
We believe our employees are key to achieving our business objectives. We have COVID-19 prevention protocols in place to minimize the spread of COVID-19 in our workplace.
 
Our key human capital measures include employee safety, turnover, absenteeism and production. We frequently benchmark our compensation practices and benefits programs against those of comparable industries and in the geographic areas where our facilities are located. We believe that our compensation and employee benefits are competitive and allow us to attract and retain skilled and unskilled labor throughout our organization. Our notable health, welfare and retirement benefits include:
 

• | Company subsidized health insurance 
--+------------------------------------------------
• | 401(k) Plan with Company matching contributions
• | Paid time off 
• | Life and disability insurance 

 
We strive to maintain an inclusive environment free from discrimination of any kind, including sexual or other discriminatory harassment. Our employees have multiple avenues available through which inappropriate behavior can be reported, including a confidential hotline. All reports of inappropriate behavior are promptly investigated with appropriate action taken to stop such behavior.
 
PATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
We have patents and other intellectual property that we believe protect the FREEDOM System, and we continue to file patent applications in connection with our research and development activities. As of December 31, 2022, we own 14 U.S. Patents and 60 foreign patents. In addition, we have 5 pending U.S. patent applications and 11 foreign patent applications. The fundamental patents protecting our drug delivery systems extend until 2034 and beyond.
