ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a late clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company discovering and developing novel therapeutics for the treatment of rare diseases and those with limited treatment options, with a focus on conditions resulting from dysfunction of the immune system. 
Our lead clinical candidate is mavorixafor, a small molecule antagonist of chemokine receptor CXCR4, that is being developed as an oral, once-daily therapy. Due to its ability to increase the mobilization of mature, functional white blood cells from the bone marrow into the bloodstream, we believe that mavorixafor has the potential to provide therapeutic benefit across a variety of chronic neutropenic disorders, including WHIM (Warts, Hypogammaglobulinemia, Infections, and Myelokathexis) syndrome, a rare, primary immunodeficiency. 
Following announcement of positive top-line data from our global, pivotal, Phase 3 clinical trial, we are currently preparing a United States regulatory submission seeking approval of oral, once-daily mavorixafor in the treatment of people aged 12 years and older with WHIM syndrome. We are also currently advancing mavorixafor in a Phase 2 clinical trial in people with certain chronic neutropenic disorders following positive results from a Phase 1b clinical trial of mavorixafor in people with idiopathic, cyclic or congenital neutropenia. 
We believe that successfully developing mavorixafor and providing new therapeutic options to individuals in the United States diagnosed with certain chronic neutropenic disorders has the potential to revolutionize the treatment landscape, which is principally served by injectable therapies that are frequently associated with treatment-limiting adverse events.
Our Focus
We have developed a pipeline of small-molecule, oral antagonists of the chemokine receptor CXCR4. CXCR4, or C-X-C receptor type 4, is a cell receptor that helps regulate the movement of immune cells within the body. CXCR4 receptor stimulation by its cognate ligand, CXCL12, has been shown to play a key role in the maturation and mobilization of white blood cells such as neutrophils, lymphocytes (including both B cells and T cells), and monocytes, into the bloodstream. Because antagonism of the CXCR4 receptor has been shown to increase the trafficking of white blood cells, we believe that therapeutic inhibition of the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis holds the potential to benefit people with a wide variety of diseases where there remain significant unmet needs, including chronic neutropenic disorders and certain types of cancer.
Chronic neutropenic disorders are rare blood conditions where people of all ages experience low levels of neutrophils and tend to be at greater risk of developing infections and certain types of cancer. Depending on the levels of circulating neutrophils in the blood, neutropenia can be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe.
We are currently focused on advancing our lead clinical candidate, mavorixafor, for the treatment of a number of chronic neutropenia indications, including WHIM syndrome, while also pursuing partnership opportunities to further advance our previous work in oncology indications.
Our Pipeline
Our deep understanding of the biology of the CXCR4 pathway has enabled us to discover and develop multiple small-molecule CXCR4 antagonists. To date, we have advanced our lead candidate, mavorixafor, into late-stage clinical development. Mavorixafor is an orally available, small-molecule CXCR4 antagonist designed to facilitate the mobilization of white blood cells from the bone marrow into the blood, to increase levels of circulating neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes, and to improve immune system function. 
To date, more than 200 patients in clinical trials have been dosed with mavorixafor, which has demonstrated a favorable tolerability profile. In these trials, we have observed drug exposure in patients, a 22-hour half-life, and bioavailability of mavorixafor to support once-daily oral dosing, which we believe would provide convenient dosing and better patient compliance for chronic or life-long use, if approved. The manufacturing process for mavorixafor utilizes well established, small-molecule chemistry, creating the potential for a commercial product that can be supported by specialty pharmacy distribution.
We have successfully advanced mavorixafor through a pivotal, Phase 3 clinical trial, referred to as the 4WHIM trial, in people with WHIM (Warts, Hypogammaglobulinemia, Infections, and Myelokathexis) syndrome, a rare, primary immunodeficiency, through a Phase 1b clinical trial in people with congenital, idiopathic, or cyclic neutropenia, and through a Phase 1b clinical trial of mavorixafor in combination with the Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib in people with a rare B-cell lymphoma called Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (“Waldenström’s”).
We have also developed two pre-clinical candidates: X4P-003, a second-generation CXCR4 antagonist designed to have enhanced properties relative to mavorixafor, potentially enabling broader opportunities in CXCR4-dependent disorders and primary immunodeficiencies; and X4P-002, a CXCR4 antagonist with a unique distribution profile and a demonstrated ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. 
* Programs only being advanced through partnership
Following our July 2022 announced strategic re-prioritization, we are now advancing mavorixafor solely in chronic neutropenic disorder indications, including WHIM syndrome, while pausing our pre-clinical programs and only progressing our oncology programs upon completion of strategic partnership(s).
About WHIM Syndrome
WHIM syndrome is both a rare combined immunodeficiency and a congenital neutropenic disorder in which the body’s immune system does not function properly and has trouble fighting infections. In many patients, WHIM is caused by “gain of function” variations in the single gene that encodes for the CXCR4 receptor. In healthy individuals, the CXCR4 receptor is typically internalized into the cell after CXCL12 binds to it, enabling the receptor to be appropriately “recycled” and the signaling to be diminished. In most WHIM patients, however, a genetic variation in the receptor gene prevents the post-binding internalization (“normal recycling”) of the receptor. As a result, the CXCR4 receptor is maintained on the surface of the cell and is exposed to the ligand, which creates a perpetual “on” signal and retention of white blood cells in the bone marrow where they are produced, leading to the chronic peripheral neutropenia, lymphopenia, and monocytopenia that are the clinical hallmarks of WHIM syndrome. 
Genetic testing is typically used to diagnose WHIM syndrome to confirm the presence of a genetic variation in the CXCR4 receptor. The diagnosis of WHIM syndrome may occur at any age: about one-half of reported patients are diagnosed as children, primarily before of at the age of 18 years, with the other half diagnosed as adults, mostly between 18 and 40 years of age.
WHIM syndrome is named for its four common clinical findings, although not all patients experience all symptoms, and not all symptoms are required for a diagnosis: Warts, related to infection with the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), Hypogammaglobulinemia, a condition of low immunoglobulin (“IG”) levels, Infections, including both bacterial and fungal infections, and Myelokathexis, a hyper-dense population of immune cells in the bone marrow. These conditions reduce the body’s ability to achieve a healthy immune response. Approximately 30-40% of people with WHIM syndrome develop HPV-associated cancers as they age.
The incidence and prevalence of WHIM syndrome are not well established. We believe that this is due to the relatively recent elucidation of the genetics underlying WHIM syndrome, lack of universal or accessible genetic testing, and limited medical education and awareness of the disease, which is in part driven by the lack of available disease-modifying treatments. Based on a preliminary U.S market research study sponsored by us and conducted by a third-party research firm, we believe that the prevalence of WHIM syndrome worldwide is significantly higher than previous registries suggest. 
•The study solicited input from community-based physicians of different specialties, including physicians focused on non-malignant hematology, immunology, dermatology, pulmonology, and infectious diseases, who are known to manage and/or treat patients with WHIM syndrome. 
•The 212 physicians across these specialties identified to participate in this study reported more than 1,700 patients in the United States with genetically confirmed or highly probable WHIM syndrome. 
In addition, we have also completed a study using artificial intelligence, interrogating a database of approximately 300 million American lives that included up to 10 years of insurance claims on diagnoses, drug treatments, procedures, and treatment pathways. This study suggests that there may be as many as 3,700 WHIM patients in the United States based on the WHIM-like phenotypes described.
The first CXCR4 genetic variation determined to cause WHIM syndrome was identified in 2003. Since then, several CXCR4 variations have been identified as “gain of function” variations causing WHIM syndrome. Our research has subsequently identified a number of new genetic variations, among them a new missense variation, called D84H, that is relatively frequent in the general population. The D84H mutation is the first mutation to be identified outside of the C-terminus of the CXCR4 receptor showing gain-of-function signaling and WHIM disease phenotype. We believe that the frequency of the D84H variation, as derived from broad population genomic databases, further supports our current WHIM prevalence estimate. Our research into additional WHIM-causing genetic variations is ongoing and we are continuing to identify novel pathogenic variants, further expanding our understanding of the clinical phenotype of people with WHIM syndrome.
In partnership with Invitae, a genetic information company, we sponsor a no-charge genetic testing and counseling program called PATH4WARD for individuals who may carry a genetic variation known to be associated with chronic neutropenia or primary immunodeficiency disorders (“PIDs”), including WHIM syndrome. The genetic panel looks at more than 550 genes known to be associated with PIDs; to date, the program has proven helpful not only in identifying WHIM patients, but also providing a better understanding of novel genetic variants causing PIDs and assisting participant enrollment in X4-sponsored clinical trials. 
We plan to continue to increase awareness of WHIM syndrome among patients, physicians, and their support systems through our partnerships with key patient foundations and registries, including the Jeffrey Modell Foundation, University of Washington, Immune Deficiency Foundation, and Hopitaux Universitaires Est Parisien (Trousseau La Roche-Guyon). 
We have also deployed of a field force of Medical Science Liaisons (“MSLs”) and Patient Diagnostic Liaisons (“PDLs”) in the United States to further drive education and awareness of WHIM syndrome and to assist in identifying WHIM patients. 
Limited Current Treatment Landscape for WHIM Syndrome
Currently, there are no approved therapies for the treatment of WHIM syndrome and care is limited to the treatment of the syndrome’s different symptoms, mainly the prevention and management of infections. None of these symptomatic treatments, however, address the underlying cause of this multi-faceted disease. Current symptoms and their treatment limitations are as follows:
•Warts: The presence of warts in WHIM syndrome is driven by an underlying HPV infection. Standard treatments, such as topical therapies (for example, imiquimod and salicylic acid), cryotherapy and laser therapy, as well as more aggressive approaches, such as cauterization or surgical removal, have been ineffective in providing durable treatment of warts associated with chronic HPV infections. As WHIM patients generally have limited response to vaccines, the HPV vaccine appears to have limited effectiveness. The number, size, and severity of visible warts in WHIM patients can have a significant negative impact on the patient’s quality of life and result in social anxiety issues. Left untreated, chronic HPV-infections are also known to increase the risk of cancer.
•Hypogammaglobulinemia: Intravenous or subcutaneous IG administration, referred to as IVIG or SCIG, respectively, can be administered to patients with low IG levels. In WHIM patients, the administration of IG therapies raises IG levels, but has shown no impact on circulating white blood cells and limited or no impact on immune responses. IG treatment of patients with WHIM syndrome is based on empirical and anecdotal evidence, and there are no clinical data demonstrating the efficacy of IG treatment for WHIM syndrome. IG treatment also does not treat or protect against HPV-associated symptoms and diseases, such as warts and certain cancers. Furthermore, IG administration is costly and time consuming.
•Infections: Bacterial infections are managed with antibiotics. Acute infections usually resolve, although we are aware of reports from clinicians citing death due to pneumonia or sepsis in young WHIM patients. Importantly, even with antibiotic use, infections are known to recur more frequently and persist longer in patients with WHIM syndrome. Further, the toll of multiple, chronic infections in WHIM patients has been known to lead to devastating irreversible pathologies such as hearing loss, due to chronic ear infections and bronchiectasis, or damaged lung airways. Patients are sometimes given granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (“G-CSF”) to increase neutrophil counts, but G-CSF has demonstrated little, if any, impact on lymphopenia or the incidence of infections in WHIM patients. Side effects of G-CSF have been reported to include disabling bone pain, which can be more severe in certain age groups. Additional, less common, treatment-limiting complications of chronic G-CSF administration include myelofibrosis and leukemia. 
•Myelokathexis: G-CSF is also sometimes used to treat the myelokathexis characteristic of WHIM syndrome to try to increase the number of neutrophils outside of the bone marrow, but G-CSF has no effect on lymphocytes and other types of white blood cells. 
While the costs of managing the chronic impact of WHIM syndrome are unknown, the per-patient cost of treating primary immunodeficiencies that are similar to WHIM syndrome, based on drug costs alone, exceeds $100,000 per year in the United States for therapies such as antibiotics, IVIG, SCIG and/or G-CSF, despite the limited effectiveness of these treatments. Beyond these estimated direct costs, other costs associated with direct and indirect management of the disease, such as repeated immunization, physician visits, or hospitalizations, have not been quantified but are likely to be significant. We believe that there is a significant need for a treatment targeting the underlying excessive signaling caused by genetic variations to the CXCR4 receptor, which is the established cause of WHIM syndrome.
Our approach to treating WHIM syndrome involves addressing the underlying cause of the disease by blocking CXCR4 signaling using mavorixafor, which has been shown to bind to the CXCR4 receptor in a manner that inhibits the receptor from being stimulated by CXCL12, enabling white blood cells to properly mature and release into the bloodstream and improving immune cell numbers and function.
Clinical Development of Mavorixafor in WHIM Syndrome
In January 2017, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of mavorixafor for the treatment of people with WHIM syndrome. This trial was an open-label, dose-escalation trial in eight WHIM patients conducted at two sites in the United States and Australia pursuant to an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application that we submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in June 2016. 
The primary objective of the Phase 2 clinical trial was to determine the safety and tolerability of mavorixafor and to determine the dose of mavorixafor for exploration in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial. The secondary objective of the Phase 2 trial was to evaluate the potential efficacy of mavorixafor in people with WHIM syndrome by measuring biomarkers, specifically absolute neutrophil (“ANC”) and lymphocyte (“ALC”) counts, over 24-hour dosing cycles. The frequency of infections, antibiotic use, hospitalizations, severity of warts lesions, and vaccine titer levels, among other metrics, were also examined. To be included in the trial, participants must have had a confirmed genetic diagnosis of WHIM syndrome, be at least 18 years of age, and have a neutrophil count equal to or less than 400 cells per microliter or a lymphocyte count equal to or less than 650 cells per microliter. 
In the trial, participants received escalating doses of mavorixafor starting at 50 mg once daily to up to 400 mg once daily. Participants were dose-escalated from their starting dose based on an in-hospital 24-hour measurement of ANC and ALC above or below the pre-defined target thresholds of 600 cells per microliter and 1,000 cells per microliter, respectively. 
We completed the dose-titration portion of the Phase 2 clinical trial in March 2018 and, based on the reported results, the Data Review Committee recommended the Phase 3 dose of 400 mg administered orally once daily. The choice of time above threshold for absolute neutrophil count (“TAT-ANC”), defined as the number of hours during which the absolute neutrophil count is raised above a 500 cells per microliter threshold, was selected as the primary endpoint of the Phase 3 clinical trial.
Following completion of the dose-titration portion of the Phase 2 clinical trial, participants were allowed to continue on study drug in a Phase 2 open-label extension trial. In June 2020, we announced the following positive data from the open-label extension portion of the Phase 2 clinical trial:
•Sustained, dose-dependent increases in white blood cells, ANC, and ALC were achieved; higher doses of mavorixafor were shown to increase the TAT-ANC at least 4.5-fold versus the TAT-ANC at lower doses.
•These long-term hematological improvements correlated with fewer infections and reduced numbers of cutaneous warts.
•A decreased yearly infection rate from 4.63 [95%CI 3.3,6.3] events in the 12 months prior to the trial, to 2.27 [95%CI 1.4, 3.5] events when treated with mavorixafor at higher doses once daily; notably, deeper reductions in yearly infection rates correlated with increased time on treatment.
•The participants with cutaneous warts on hands and/or feet at baseline achieved an average 75% reduction in the number of warts.
•Mavorixafor was well tolerated for the extended duration of up to more than two years without any attributable serious adverse effects.
In December 2021, we announced the following additional data from the Phase 2 open-label extension trial of mavorixafor in people with WHIM syndrome:
•Mavorixafor continued to show durable increases in neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes, sustained improvements in infections and warts, and was well tolerated (median treatment duration = 148.4 weeks).
•Decreases in mean annualized infection rates correlated well with TAT-ANC.
•Standardized participant interviews revealed that long-term treatment with mavorixafor was well tolerated and continued to demonstrate beneficial treatment effects, including decreased frequency, severity, and duration of infections and fewer hospital/doctor visits.
In June 2019, we initiated 4WHIM, a pivotal, global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase 3 clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mavorixafor in people with genetically confirmed WHIM syndrome. Originally designed to enroll 18-28 patients, the trial achieved full enrollment in September 2021, with 31 participants aged 12 and older receiving either 200-400 mg mavorixafor or placebo orally once daily for 52 weeks; all participants then became eligible to receive treatment with mavorixafor in an open-label trial extension. 
The primary endpoint of the 4WHIM trial is a clinically relevant reduction of duration of severe neutropenia as measured by the increase in TAT-ANC (500 cells per microliter) in peripheral blood. Secondary endpoints include time above threshold-absolute lymphocyte count (TAT-ALC) of ≥ 1,000 cells per microliter over a 24-hour period, a composite clinical efficacy endpoint for mavorixafor based on total infection score and total wart change score, total wart change score for mavorixafor based on central blinded, independent review of 3 target skin regions, total infection score for mavorixafor based on number and severity of infections adjudicated by a blinded, independent adjudication committee; and a number of quality-of-life measurements and other exploratory endpoints.
In November 2022, we reported positive top-line results from the Phase 3 4WHIM trial:
•4WHIM met its primary endpoint, with mavorixafor achieving clinical and statistical superiority over placebo (P<0.0001) when measuring the length of time that participants’ ANC remained above a clinically meaningful threshold of 500 cells per microliter (severe neutropenia), over 24-hour periods at 4 time points throughout the 52-week trial.
•4WHIM also met a key secondary endpoint, with mavorixafor achieving clinical and statistical superiority over placebo (P<0.0001) when measuring the length of time that participants’ ALC remained above a clinically meaningful threshold of 1,000 cells per microliter (lymphopenia), over 24-hour periods at 4 time points throughout the 52-week trial.
•Mavorixafor was generally well tolerated in the trial, with no treatment-related serious adverse events reported and no discontinuations for safety events.
Additional data review and analysis of the secondary and exploratory endpoints of the 4WHIM trial are ongoing, with plans to present detailed results at a medical meeting in the second quarter of 2023. Given these positive results to date, we are targeting submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) early in the second half of 2023, with the goal of obtaining approval for mavorixafor for the treatment of people in the United States, aged 12 and older, with WHIM syndrome. 
Mavorixafor has received multiple special designations from global regulatory authorities in WHIM syndrome, including Breakthrough Therapy Designation, Fast Track Designation, and Rare Pediatric Designation in the United States, and Orphan Drug Status in both the United States and European Union. In addition, upon approval of an NDA, we are eligible to receive a Priority Review Voucher (“PRV”) as a result of mavorixafor’s Rare Pediatric Designation in the United States.
About Chronic Neutropenic Disorders
Due to its demonstrated ability to durably elevate levels of circulating white blood cells across multiple clinical trials, we believe that mavorixafor may be useful in the treatment of people with a variety of chronic neutropenic disorders. 
Chronic neutropenia is defined as periods lasting more than three months persistently or intermittently where there are abnormally low levels of neutrophils circulating in the blood, and may be idiopathic (of unknown origin), cyclic (episodes typically occurring every three weeks), or congenital (of genetic causation). Similar to WHIM syndrome, chronic neutropenia disorders are rare blood conditions similarly characterized by increased risks of infections and cancer due to abnormally low levels of neutrophils in the body. In all cases, the CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway is the key regulator of neutrophil release from the bone marrow. 
The incidence and prevalence of chronic neutropenic disorders are not well established. In December 2022, we presented results from what we believe was the first study examining the prevalence of chronic neutropenia disorders (including idiopathic, cyclic, and congenital neutropenia) in the United States; we believe that determining the estimated projected prevalence of chronic neutropenic disorders is a key step to understanding the extent of existing unmet medical needs in this patient population.
•Using a retrospective analysis of a large U.S. claims database, the analysis included people with a diagnosis code for neutropenia during the calendar years 2018, 2019, and 2021 (the year 2020 was excluded from this analysis owing to anticipated reduced claims during the COVID-19 pandemic). 
•People with a diagnostic, procedural, or product code for neutropenia resulting from secondary causes including chemotherapy, drug exposure, infection, solid organ transplantation, myelodysplastic syndrome, and end-stage renal disease within 24-month period prior to selection were excluded. 
•A 13- to 24-month lookback period prior to index date was used to confirm chronic status.
•The analysis used longitudinal prescription data and office-based claims data from an IQVIA claims database that included 93% of retail prescription claims, 77% of mail-in prescription claims, and had more than 1.5 billion office-based claims per year. 
•This retrospective analysis projected that in 2021, up to 48,000 people in the United States were living with a diagnosis of chronic neutropenia, with the most common type of chronic neutropenic disorder being idiopathic (~40,000), followed by cyclic (~5,000), and congenital (~3,000), and with the majority of affected people being female adults.
In 2022, we also completed an electronic medical records study to better understand the risk of serious or severe infection in people with chronic neutropenia in the United States, analyzing the medical records of 44 healthcare organizations treating approximately 66 million patients. The analysis examined patients who had experienced at least two Serious Infections Events (“SIEs”) following documentation of chronic neutropenia in each calendar year compared with those who did not have neutropenia. SIEs are defined as infections requiring hospitalization or intravenous antibiotics or that result in disability or death. 
•The results of this analysis indicated that the incidence rate of SIEs per 100,000 person days was increased for all levels of chronic neutropenia: it was two times greater for patients with any chronic neutropenia (ANC less than 1,500 cells per microliter) and four times greater for patients with severe congenital neutropenia (ANC less than 500 cells per microliter). 
•The risk of serious infection increased with the worsening of neutropenia. 
•Approximately 25% of patients with chronic neutropenia had at least 2 SIEs in the latest calendar year examined, which was 2019.
People living with chronic neutropenia have few treatment options and may be treated with G-CSF, an injectable therapy approved in the United States for the treatment of severe, chronic neutropenia. G-CSF is used to stimulate the bone marrow to produce neutrophils. Side effects of G-CSF include disabling bone pain, which can be more severe in certain age groups. Additional, less common, treatment-limiting complications of chronic G-CSF administration include myelofibrosis and leukemia. In chronic neutropenia cases that are unresponsive to G-CSF, or if leukemia has developed, bone marrow transplants have been made with varying degrees of success. Bone marrow transplantation is often applied to severe neutropenia from bone marrow failure. Bone marrow transplants bring additional risks into the management of the disorders. 
Clinical Development of Mavorixafor in Chronic Neutropenic Disorders
In 2022, we conducted a proof-of-concept Phase 1b open-label, multicenter study designed to assess the safety and tolerability of oral mavorixafor, with or without injectable G-CSF, in participants with chronic neutropenic disorders, including idiopathic, cyclic, and congenital neutropenia. Participants received a single dose of 400 mg oral mavorixafor to assess the magnitude of treatment response. 
In September 2022, we announced positive results from the Phase 1b clinical trial:
•A total of 25 participants were enrolled in the study.
•100% of study participants responded to treatment with a single dose of 400 mg of mavorixafor, alone or dosed concurrently with G-CSF:
◦Participants achieved a mean ANC increase at peak of >3,000 cells per microliter.
◦Consistent responses were seen across all of the chronic neutropenic disorders studied – idiopathic, cyclic, and congenital neutropenia.
•All neutropenic participants (n=14) reached normalized ANC levels (>1,500 cells per microliter): 
◦When assessed as a monotherapy in participants with severe chronic neutropenia who were not being treated with G-CSF (n=6), a single dose of mavorixafor led to normalized ANC levels in all participants within 2 hours, with a mean ANC increase at peak of ~2,500 cells per microliter.
◦When assessed in participants with moderate or severe neutropenia, despite being treated with G-CSF (n=8), 100% reached normalized ANC levels, suggesting the potential of mavorixafor to both normalize the neutrophil counts in patients with partial response to G-CSF and also to potentially enable the reduction or elimination of G-CSF dosing. 
•When assessed in participants with chronic neutropenia with normalized ANC counts on chronic G-CSF (n=11), all participants experienced a consistent and sustained increase in ANC, suggesting mavorixafor’s potential to reduce or possibly eliminate G-CSF treatment in these patients. 
•Mavorixafor was well tolerated in the study; all treatment-related adverse events were deemed to be low grade, consistent with previous clinical studies in WHIM syndrome, and no treatment-related serious adverse events were reported.
Following these positive results, an amendment to the Phase 1b clinical trial was initiated aiming to evaluate the use of daily oral mavorixafor with or without injectable G-CSF for up to 6 months in participants with chronic neutropenic disorders as a Phase 2 clinical trial. The Phase 2 trial is expected to assess the durability of ANC responses, the potential of mavorixafor to enable patients to taper down dosing with G-CSF, and to evaluate the tolerability of mavorixafor in combination with G-CSF in chronic use. Participants are now being enrolled in this Phase 2 clinical trial and we expect to provide an update on clinical results in the 
second or third quarter of 2023. 
Concurrent with this Phase 2 trial execution, we are advancing our plans to conduct a Phase 3 program of mavorixafor in people with certain chronic neutropenic disorders in the event the Phase 2 results are positive. We expect this trial will be a randomized, placebo-controlled trial assessing the safety and efficacy of mavorixafor, with or without concomitant G-CSF, in people with idiopathic, cyclic, or congenital neutropenia. We expect to provide more clarity on the scope and timing of this potential clinical program in the second or third quarter of 2023.
Oncology Programs
In previous clinical and research studies, CXCR4 antagonism has been proven to increase the maturation and mobilization of white blood cells in all those dosed, including healthy volunteers, increase circulating neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes, reduce bacterial and viral infections, and reduce lymphoma burden in combination with approved oncology therapeutics.
As a result of these previous studies, we conducted several clinical programs exploring the potential utility of mavorixafor in the treatment of certain cancers. Any further development of mavorixafor or other pipeline candidate(s) for any oncology indication will be subject to completion of a strategic partnership.
Mavorixafor in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia
Waldenström’s is a rare form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder most often caused by genetic variations in an immune-signaling gene called MYD88. Approximately 30-40% of people with Waldenström’s have been shown to have a second genetic variation, a somatic WHIM-like activating variation in the CXCR4 gene in the cancer cells that define this rare form of lymphoma. Patients with the CXCR4 genetic variation have higher serum immunoglobulin M (“IgM”) levels and greater incidence of symptomatic hyperviscosity. These patients also have a worse prognosis and weaker responses to treatment with Bruton tyrosine kinase (“BTK”) inhibitors. 
In December 2022, we completed a Phase 1b, open-label, multicenter, single-arm study evaluating the safety and efficacy of mavorixafor in combination with the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib in adult participants (either treatment naïve or relapsed/refractory) with Waldenström’s and confirmed MYD88 and CXCR4 genetic variations. The Phase 1b clinical trial examined intra-patient dose escalation, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of mavorixafor plus ibrutinib in participants aged 18 years or older. 
Interim results of the clinical trial were announced in August 2022; full clinical trial results are expected to be submitted to an appropriate medical journal for publication in the future. As of June 2022:
•A total of 16 participants were enrolled; all were dosed with oral, once-daily doses of ibrutinib (420 mg) and escalating doses (200 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg) of oral mavorixafor, also once daily.
•Ten of the 11 evaluable participants (91%) had achieved a major response (“MR”) to therapy, or a greater than 50% reduction in serum IgM from baseline:
◦In relapsed/refractory participants, 7 of 7 (100%) achieved a MR.
◦In treatment-naïve patients, 3 of 4 (75%) achieved a MR.
•Adding mavorixafor to ibrutinib was associated with a higher MR rate at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months compared to previously reported MR rates achieved with ibrutinib monotherapy.
•In addition, patients achieved elevations in ANC, with no neutropenic events reported; patients also experienced fewer infections over time with chronic dosing.
•No major safety signals had been identified in the trial as of the data cut-off; mavorixafor in combination with ibrutinib showed a safety profile similar to ibrutinib monotherapy (N=16, including 8 patients escalated to the 600 mg dose of mavorixafor).
The Phase 1b clinical trial of mavorixafor in Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia trial was conducted as part of a collaboration with The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (“LLS”) to accelerate the development of mavorixafor for the treatment of Waldenström’s. Mavorixafor was selected for LLS’s Therapy Acceleration Program®, a strategic initiative where LLS builds business alliances and collaborations with biotechnology companies and academic researchers to speed the development of new therapies for blood cancers.
In June 2022, mavorixafor was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for the treatment of patients with Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, regardless of CXCR4 genetic variant status.
Mavorixafor in Immuno-Oncology Indications 
In solid tumors, the tumor micro-environment (“TME”) consists of the tumor cells and cancer associated fibroblasts (“CAFs”), each of which overproduce growth factors and chemokines to support immune-suppression and malignant cell proliferation and growth. Evidence suggests that the pro-tumor signals between tumor cells and CAFs occur, in part, through chemokine signaling, including through the over-production of CXCL12. 
The CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway has been shown to be overstimulated in more than 20 solid and blood-derived tumor types. Excessive stimulation of CXCR4 due to high concentrations of CXCL12 influences the trafficking of immune cells, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (“MDSCs”), CD4+ regulatory T cells (“Tregs”), CD8+ T cells (“killer T cells”), and mature dendritic cells. We believe that blocking CXCR4 overstimulation can lead to improved immune-cell trafficking and increase the absolute number of CD8+ T-cells, thereby also increasing the ratio of CD8+ T-cells to Tregs in the TME, turning the TME from an immunosuppressive environment to an immunostimulatory one.
Previously, we completed three clinical trials in solid tumors (two in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, one in melanoma) to explore the impact of mavorixafor on relevant tumor biomarkers and clinical responses. In all studies, combination of mavorixafor with standard of care proved to be well tolerated and showed favorable impact on key immune-response biomarkers (e.g. increased proliferation of CD8+ T-cells and CD8+ T-cells to Treg ratios in the TME) and improvement in clinical metrics (response rates) vs. historical controls of single-agent standards of care. 
Ongoing trials in triple-negative breast cancer are being undertaken by Abbisko, our strategic partner for development and commercialization in greater China. Future development and potential commercialization of mavorixafor in potential immuno-oncology indications in markets outside of greater China will be pursued only as part of additional potential strategic collaboration(s).
Competition
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved products than we do. Other firms also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors with us, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
Our commercial opportunities could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize therapeutics that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain marketing approvals for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our products, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected because in some cases insurers or other third-party payors, including government programs, seek to encourage the use of generic products. This may have the effect of making branded products less attractive to buyers from a cost perspective.
We are aware of other companies that are developing CXCR4 inhibitors that are in a similar stage of development as mavorixafor, including BioLineRx (motixafortide), Noxxon (NOXA12), Upsher-Smith, Polyphor (Balixafortide), and Glycomimetics (GMI1359). To our knowledge, there do not appear to be any competitors with programs in development for WHIM syndrome or chronic neutropenia. With respect to chronic neutropenia, filgrastim injections (human G-CSF) and two biosimilars (Zarxio and Nivestym) are FDA approved to reduce the incidence and duration of after-effects of severe neutropenia (e.g. fever‚ infections‚ oropharyngeal ulcers) in symptomatic patients with severe neutropenia.
In Waldenström’s, there are several treatment approaches currently being developed, including targeted therapies and immunotherapies (as monotherapies and combination therapies), chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation, and cancer vaccines. To our knowledge, only mavorixafor is targeting the CXCR4 pathway. Development of a Bristol Myers’ anti-CXCR4 antibody was discontinued.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of mavorixafor or any of our other product candidates. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of any of our product or product candidates.
We currently have a master services agreement (“the Aptuit Agreement”) in place with Aptuit (Oxford) Ltd (“Aptuit”), pursuant to which Aptuit develops and manufactures the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) for mavorixafor. The term of the Aptuit Agreement expires in February 2024 unless terminated by us and/or Aptuit. Aptuit is our sole supplier for mavorixafor drug substance and is currently manufacturing mavorixafor drug substance at a commercially relevant scale to support our ongoing and anticipated future supply needs. 
We also have a master services agreement in place with Catalent Inc., formerly Mayne Pharma Inc. (“Catalent”), which is our sole manufacturer for the final capsule drug product formulation of mavorixafor. The term of the master services agreement with Catalent expires on September 10, 2023, and may be terminated by (1) us upon 30 days-notice to Catalent or (2) by either party following a material breach by the other party that remains uncured for 30 days.
We obtain the supplies of our drug products from Aptuit and Catalent pursuant to typical industry standard clinical supply agreements. We believe that both manufacturers have the capability and capacity to manufacture currently projected clinical trial supply and commercial volumes of mavorixafor. We expect to extend both of these manufacturing agreements beyond their current expiration dates. 
Sales and Marketing 
We intend to build a commercial infrastructure to support sales of any of our approved products. We expect to manage sales, marketing and distribution through internal resources and third-party relationships. While we may commit significant financial and management resources to commercial activities, we will also consider collaborating with one or more pharmaceutical companies to enhance our commercial capabilities.
License Agreements
License Agreement with Genzyme
In July 2014, we entered into a license agreement with Genzyme, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanofi, pursuant to which we were granted an exclusive license to certain patent applications and other intellectual property owned or controlled by Genzyme related to the CXCR4 receptor to develop and commercialize products containing licensed compounds, including but not limited to mavorixafor. Genzyme has retained the non-exclusive right to conduct preclinical research involving compounds in any field, including any fields licensed to us, but has not retained rights to conduct any clinical development or commercialization of those compounds identified in the agreement in any of the fields licensed to us. We are primarily responsible for the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of all patent applications and patents covering the intellectual property licensed to us under the agreement at our sole expense.
We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products for use in the field in the United States and at least one other major market country. We have the right to grant sublicenses of the licensed rights that cover mavorixafor to third parties.  If we wish to grant a sublicense to any licensed product other than mavorixafor, we are obligated to first offer the sublicense to Genzyme. If Genzyme expresses written interest for the sublicense, then we will negotiate exclusively with Genzyme for a certain stated period to obtain a license to such rights, after which Genzyme shall have no further rights with respect to such licensed product and we will be free to negotiate a sublicense with respect to such licensed product with any third party.
We are obligated to pay Genzyme milestone payments in the aggregate amount of up to $25 million, contingent upon our achievement of certain late-stage regulatory and sales milestones with respect to licensed products, and tiered royalties based on net sales of licensed products that we commercialize under the Genzyme agreement. Our obligation to pay royalties for each licensed product expires on a country-by-country basis on the latest of (i) the expiration of licensed patent rights that cover that licensed product in that country, (ii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity in that country and (iii) ten years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product in that country. Royalty rates are subject to reduction under the agreement in specified circumstances, including in any country if we are required to obtain a license from any third party to the extent our patent rights might infringe the third party’s patent rights, if a licensed product is not covered by a valid claim in that country or if sales of generic products reach certain thresholds in that country. Sublicenses that we enter into under the Genzyme agreement, including our license agreement with Abbisko obligate us to pay Genzyme a percentage of certain upfront, maintenance fees, milestone payments and royalty payments paid to us by the sublicensee. 
The term of the Genzyme Agreement will continue until the later of the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the patents licensed under the agreement that cover any licensed product, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity applicable to any licensed product and 10 years from the date of first commercial sale of any licensed product. Either we or Genzyme may terminate the Genzyme Agreement in the event of the bankruptcy or uncured material breach by the other party. Genzyme may terminate the Genzyme Agreement if we or our affiliates initiate a patent challenge of the patents licensed under the agreement. We may terminate the Genzyme Agreement immediately upon notice to Genzyme if we reasonably believe that the development or commercialization of a licensed compound or product under the Genzyme agreement would result in a material safety issue for 
patients.
License Agreement with Georgetown University
In December 2016, we entered into a license agreement with the Georgetown University (“Georgetown”) pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to practice certain methods, and to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import products, covered by licensed patent rights co-owned by Georgetown. The rights licensed to us are for all therapeutic, prophylactic and diagnostic uses in all disease indications in humans and animals. We have the right to grant sublicenses of the licensed rights to third parties to the extent consistent with the terms of the Georgetown agreement.
Under the terms of the Georgetown agreement we paid a one-time only, upfront fee of $50 thousand, and we may be required to pay milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $800 thousand related to commercial sales of a licensed product. We are responsible for all patent prosecution costs incurred with respect to the licensed patents. We are obligated under the agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed product, to make licensed product reasonably available to the public, to obtain government approvals for licensed product and to market licensed product in quantities sufficient to meet the market demand.
The term of the Georgetown agreement will continue until the expiration of the last valid claim within the patent rights covering the licensed products. Georgetown may terminate the Georgetown agreement or convert our license to non-exclusive in the event (i) we fail to pay any amount and fail to cure such failure within 30 days after receipt of notice, (ii) we default in our obligation to obtain and maintain insurance and fail to remedy such breach within 45 days after receipt of notice, (iii) we declare insolvency or bankruptcy or (iv) we materially default in the performance of any material obligations under the Georgetown agreement which is not cured within a certain period from the date of written notice of such default. We may terminate the Georgetown agreement at any time upon at least 60 days’ written notice.
License Agreement with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
In December 2016, we entered into a license agreement with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (“BIDMC”) pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import of licensed products and certain processes covered by licensed patent rights co-owned by BIDMC and a nonexclusive royalty-free right to use certain information pertaining to any invention claimed in the licensed patents that is owned by BIDMC to develop, make, have made, use, have used, sell, have sold and commercialize such licensed products and processes. The rights licensed to us are for all fields of use. We have the right to grant sublicenses of the licensed rights to third parties to the extent consistent with the terms of the BIDMC agreement.
Under the terms of the BIDMC agreement we paid a one-time only, upfront fee of $20 thousand and we are responsible for all future patent prosecution costs.
The term of the BIDMC agreement will continue until the expiration of the last valid claim within the patent rights covering the licensed product. BIDMC may terminate the agreement in the event (i) we fail to pay any amount and fail to cure such failure within 15 days after receipt of notice, (ii) the insurance coverage that we are obligated to maintain under the agreement is terminated and we fail to obtain replacement insurance within a certain period of time following notice to BIDMC, or (iii) we declare insolvency or bankruptcy. In addition, if we are in material breach of any material provisions of the BIDMC agreement and fail to remedy such breach within 60 days after receipt of notice, BIDMC may terminate the BIDMC agreement or terminate any licenses granted under the BIDMC agreement with respect to the country or countries in which such material breach has occurred. We may terminate the BIDMC agreement at any time upon at least 90 days’ written notice.
License Agreement with Dana Farber Cancer Institute 
In November 2020, we entered into a license agreement with Dana Farber Cancer Institute (“DFCI”) pursuant to which we obtained a non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, make, have made, develop, market, import, distribute, sell and have sold  licensed products and certain processes covered by licensed patent rights owned by DFCI. The rights licensed to us are for the therapeutic use of our CXCR4 antagonists for the treatment of Waldenström’s in combination with BTK inhibitors, including ibrutinib. We have the right to grant sublicenses of the licensed rights to third parties to the extent consistent with the terms of the DFCI agreement.
Under the terms of the DFCI agreement we paid a one-time, upfront fee of $25 thousand and we are responsible for the reimbursement of certain future patent prosecution cost and the payment of an annual maintenance fee. We are obligated to pay DFCI milestone payments in the aggregate amount of up to approximately $32 million, contingent upon our achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones with respect to licensed products, and a flat royalty based on net sales of licensed products that we commercialize under the DFCI agreement.
The term of the DFCI agreement will continue until the expiration of the last valid claim within the patent rights covering the licensed product. DFCI may terminate the DFCI agreement in the event (i) we fail to pay any amount and fail to cure such failure within 30 days after receipt of notice, (ii) we cease to carry on our business with respect to the licensed products or process, (iii) the insurance coverage that we are obligated to maintain under the DCFI agreement is terminated and we fail to obtain replacement insurance within a certain period of time following notice to DFCI, (iv) we fail to comply with certain diligence obligations and cure any such default within 60 days after receipt of written notice, (v) we have granted a sublicense without notifying DFCI or on terms inconsistent with the terms required of sublicenses under the DCFI agreement, (vi) an officer of our company, an affiliate or sublicensee is convicted of a felony relating to the manufacture, use, sale or importation of a licensed product, (vii) we or any of our affiliates, sublicensees or sublicensees’ affiliates initiate a patent challenge of the patents licensed under the DFCI agreement or assists others in doing so or (viii) we declare insolvency or bankruptcy. In addition, if we are in material breach of any material obligations under the DFCI agreement and fail to remedy such breach within 90 days after receipt of notice, DFCI may terminate the DFCI agreement or terminate any licenses granted under the agreement. We may terminate the DFCI agreement at any time upon at least 90 days’ written notice.
Abbisko Agreement
In July 2019, we entered into a license agreement with Abbisko. Under the terms of the agreement, we granted Abbisko the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize mavorixafor in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. The agreement provides Abbisko with the exclusive rights in this territory to develop and commercialize mavorixafor in combination with checkpoint inhibitors or other agents in oncology indications. Pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer and triple negative breast cancer will be explored initially. We retain the full rest-of-world rights to develop and commercialize mavorixafor outside of Greater China for all indications and the ability to utilize data generated pursuant to the Abbisko collaboration for rest-of-world development. In addition, Abbisko has the right of first refusal if we determine to pursue additional products in the Abbisko Territory, as defined in the agreement. We entered into a separate agreement in April 2020 whereby we will provide Abbisko with a clinical supply and, if the product is commercialized in the territory licensed by Abbisko, we intend to enter into a commercial supply of the licensed compound.
Pursuant to the agreement with Abbisko, upon the closing of a qualified financing of Abbisko, as defined in the agreement, which occurred in March 2020, Abbisko made a one-time, non-refundable, non-creditable financial milestone payment of $3 million to us. We are also eligible to receive potential development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to $214 million, which will vary based on the ultimate sales, if any, of the approved licensed products. Upon commercialization of mavorixafor in the Abbisko Territory, we are eligible to receive a tiered royalty, with a percentage range in the low double-digits, on net sales of approved licensed products. Abbisko is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize mavorixafor in the Abbisko Territory. Abbisko has responsibility for all activities and costs associated with the further development, manufacture and commercialization of mavorixafor in the Abbisko Territory.
Intellectual Property
Our ability to commercialize our product candidates depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our product candidates, including mavorixafor, and our preclinical compounds and core technologies. Our policy is to seek to protect our intellectual property position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to the technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business strategy. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
We file patent applications directed to our product candidates, preclinical compounds and related technologies to establish intellectual property positions on these compounds and their uses in disease. As of December 31, 2022, we owned or exclusively licensed 18 issued U.S. patents, 14 pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, eight pending U.S. provisional patent application, and approximately 175 PCT and foreign patents and patent applications in the following foreign jurisdictions: Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, European Patent Office, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Italy, Israel, Japan, Lichtenstein, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.
As of December 31, 2022, our in-licensed intellectual property portfolio for mavorixafor included three issued U.S. patents and one pending U.S. patent application directed to mavorixafor, including one issued U.S. patent with claims directed to a crystalline salt form of mavorixafor, one issued U.S. patent directed to pharmaceutical compositions of mavorixafor in unit dosage form, and one issued U.S. patents directed to methods of making mavorixafor and key intermediates. These in-licensed patents are expected to expire between 2024 and 2027. We also had four issued U.S. patents directed to compositions and methods of making chemical compounds related to the X4P-001 program. Approximately 61 corresponding foreign patents directed to compositions of matter and related chemical compounds as well as methods of making and methods of use were issued or pending. All of the above patents and patent applications were exclusively licensed to us pursuant to the terms of the Genzyme agreement.
Additionally, we have filed our own patent applications with respect to the mavorixafor and X4P-002 product candidates. Some of these patent applications are co-owned with Genzyme, BIDMC or Georgetown, with their rights exclusively licensed to us. As of December 31, 2022, our independently generated intellectual property portfolio included seven granted U.S. patents, ten pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, four pending U.S. provisional patent applications, and approximately 72 pending PCT and foreign patent applications related to our mavorixafor clinical programs in cancer and primary immunodeficiencies. In addition, we have four granted U.S. patents, four pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, four pending provisional applications and approximately 38 pending PCT and foreign patent applications related to our preclinical compounds and X4P-002 in glioblastoma. Patents issuing from these applications, if any, are expected to expire between 2036 and 2043.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, (the “USPTO”), in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a U.S. patent that covers a drug or biological product may also be eligible for patent term extension when approval from the FDA is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. In the future, if our product candidates receive approval from the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug and other factors. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or other favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents.
As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our product candidates, including mavorixafor, and our preclinical compounds, and our core technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, patent applications that we may file or license from third parties may not result in the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Any issued patents that we may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. For example, prior to March 16, 2013, in the United States, patent applications were subject to a “first to invent” rule of law. Applications filed after March 16, 2013 (except for certain applications claiming the benefit of earlier-filed applications) are subject to a “first to file” rule of law.
Discoveries reported in the scientific literature often lag the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. We cannot be certain that any existing or future application will be subject to the “first to file” or “first to invent” rule of law, that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our existing patents or pending patent applications subject to the prior laws, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions subject to the new laws. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology we have claimed in our patents or patent applications, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent.
In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected consultants, scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed under those agreements.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
The FDA Approval Process
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, (the “FDCA”), and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as imposition of clinical holds, refusal by the FDA to approve pending NDAs, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
Pharmaceutical product development in the United States typically involves preclinical or other nonclinical laboratory and animal tests and the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence. For commercial approval, the sponsor must submit adequate tests by all methods reasonably applicable to show that the drug is safe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended or suggested in the proposed labeling. The sponsor must also submit substantial evidence, generally consisting of adequate, well-controlled clinical trials to establish that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended or suggested in the proposed labeling. In certain cases, the FDA may determine that a drug is effective based on one clinical study plus confirmatory evidence. 
Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal requirements, including the FDA’s good laboratory practices regulations and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (“USDA’s”), regulations implementing the Animal Welfare Act. The results of nonclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term nonclinical tests, such as animal studies of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has not imposed a clinical hold on the IND or otherwise commented or questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations, (ii) in compliance with GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors, and (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with the FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board (“IRB”) at each site where a trial will be conducted for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements or may impose other conditions.
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In general, in Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human volunteers or, in some cases, patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. The FDA may, however, determine that a drug is effective based on one clinical trial plus confirmatory evidence. In some cases, the FDA may require post-market studies, known as Phase 4 studies, to be conducted as a condition of approval to gather additional information on the drug’s effect in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use. Depending on the risks posed by the drugs, other post-market requirements may be imposed.
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, subject to certain exceptions and waivers, such as for orphan-designated drugs.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. Under the performance goals established pursuant to the Prescription Drug User Fee Act the FDA aims to complete review of 90% of standard (non-priority) NDAs within 10 months filing and within six months for priority NDAs. 
The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, which is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current GMP is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. 
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for health care professionals, and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
The Hatch-Waxman Act
Orange Book Listing
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are considered to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug, are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug in accordance with state law.
The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement, certifying that its proposed ANDA labeling does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use, rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.
If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired.

Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which time the FDA cannot receive any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application seeking approval of a drug that references a version of the NCE drug. Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert, are associated with a three-year period of exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that includes the change.
An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification and thus no ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period.
Five-year and three-year exclusivities do not preclude FDA approval of a 505(b)(1) application for a duplicate version of the drug during the period of exclusivity, provided that the 505(b)(1) applicant conducts or obtains a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Patent Term Extension
After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase—the time between IND submission and NDA submission—and all of the review phase—the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years.
For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the USPTO must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted.
Advertising and Promotion
Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs.
Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
Adverse Event Reporting and GMP Compliance
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, require a REMS special communications regarding the safety of the drug or heightened surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to GMP after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with GMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with GMP. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides NDA holders a six-month period of exclusivity attached to any other exclusivity listed with FDA—patent or non-patent—for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for pediatric exclusivity include a determination by the FDA that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population; a written request by the FDA for pediatric studies; and agreement by the applicant to perform the requested studies and the submission to the FDA, completion of the studies in accordance with the written request, and the acceptance by the FDA of the reports of the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. 
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective, unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver from the FDA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. The sponsor or the FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data need to be collected before the pediatric studies begin. 
Orphan Drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition—generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States (or affects more than 200,000 in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales of such drug in the United States). Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. If the FDA designates an orphan drug based on a finding of clinical superiority, the FDA must provide a written notification to the sponsor that states the basis for orphan designation, including “any plausible hypothesis” relied upon by the FDA. The FDA must also publish a summary of its clinical superiority findings upon granting orphan drug exclusivity based on clinical superiority.
Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
Breakthrough Designation
A product can be designated as a breakthrough therapy by FDA if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. A sponsor may request that a product candidate be designated as a breakthrough therapy concurrently with the submission of an IND or any time before an end-of-Phase-2 meeting, and the FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. If so designated, the FDA shall act to expedite the development and review of the product’s marketing application, including by meeting with the sponsor throughout the product’s development, providing timely advice to the sponsor to ensure that the development program to gather pre-clinical and clinical data is as efficient as practicable, involving senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor, and taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable.
Rest of World Government Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are and will be subject, either directly or through our distribution partners, to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products, if approved.
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in non-U.S. countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Sales of pharmaceutical products in the United States will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, and commercial insurance and managed health care organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Coverage and reimbursement policies for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor as there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products among third party payors in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
Additionally, the containment of health care costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, utilization management and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, imposed requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries and included a major expansion of the prescription drug benefit under Medicare Part D. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D is available through both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Parts A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee.
Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.
Healthcare Reform
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the ACA, was enacted with the goal of expanding coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall health care costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA expanded and increased industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and made changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare D program. There have been challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, on June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that 
include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. In addition, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA. 
Also, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several Presidential executive orders, Congressional hearings and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. For example, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. In addition, the IRA, among other things, (i) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare, and subject drug manufacturers to civil monetary penalties and a potential excise tax by offering a price that is not equal to or less than the negotiated “maximum fair price” for such drugs and biologics under the law, and (ii) imposes rebates with respect to certain drugs and biologics covered under Medicare Part B or Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. The IRA permits HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. It is currently unclear how the IRA will be implemented but is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Further, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to submit a report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. It is unclear whether this executive order or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future. Further, Congress is considering additional health reform measures. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, some E.U. jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. Such differences in national pricing regimes may create price differentials between E.U. member states. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States. In the European Union, the downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, has become intense. As a result, barriers to entry of new products are becoming increasingly high and patients are unlikely to use a drug product that is not reimbursed by their government.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
Our current and future operations may subject us to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our research and proposed sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:
•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
•federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;
•the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
•the federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, that require drug manufacturers to disclose payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians, (currently defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;
•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements on “covered entities,” including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their respective “business associates” that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, and their covered subcontractors, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and
•Foreign and state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, state and local laws governing the disclosure of payments to health care professionals, state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, state laws that require the reporting of information related to drug pricing, state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to it, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
Human Capital Policies and Procedures
As of December 31, 2022, we had 70 full-time employees. Of these employees, 47 were engaged in research and development and 23 were engaged in selling, general and administrative functions.
