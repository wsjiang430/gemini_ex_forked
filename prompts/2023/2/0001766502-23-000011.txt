Item 1. Business
Overview
Chewy, Inc. began operating as Chewy.com in 2011 and Chewy.com, LLC was formed as a Delaware limited liability company in October 2013. On March 16, 2016, Chewy.com, LLC converted from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation and changed its name to Chewy, Inc. Chewy, Inc. completed the initial public offering of its Class A common stock on June 18, 2019. Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “Chewy,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” refer to Chewy, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Our mission is to be the most trusted and convenient destination for pet parents and partners everywhere. We believe that we are the preeminent online source for pet products, supplies and prescriptions as a result of our broad selection of high-quality products and services, which we offer at competitive prices and deliver with an exceptional level of care and a personal touch to build brand loyalty and drive repeat purchasing. We seek to continually develop innovative ways for our customers to engage with us, as our website and mobile app allow our pet parents to manage their pets’ health, wellness, and merchandise needs, while enabling them to conveniently shop for our products. We partner with more than 3,500 of the best and most trusted brands in the pet industry offering more than 110,000 products and services offerings, to bring what we believe is a high-bar, customer-centric experience to our customers. By leveraging our extensive infrastructure of our supply chain consisting of seventeen fulfillment centers, we are typically able to offer our products in a localized manner with the capability to serve over 80% of the U.S. population overnight and almost 100% in two days.
Our Industry
We operate in a large and growing industry in the U.S., which consists of pet food and treats, pet supplies and pet medications, other pet-health products, and pet services.
“Pet humanization” and premiumization driving higher spending per pet
Pet parents increasingly view pets as part of the family and are willing to spend more on higher-quality goods and services for those family members. According to research conducted by Packaged Facts, 94% of dog or cat owners considered their pets to be a part of their family. Amongst dog owners, 90% agree that pets are central to their home life, with 87% of cat owners and 85% of other pet owners being in agreement. Furthermore, according to Packaged Facts, 89% of pet owners agreed that they look for products to improve their pets’ health and wellness, with 61% willing to pay more for food customized for their pet’s specific dietary needs.
Historical and projected growth in pet spending
According to Packaged Facts, spending on the U.S. pet market has grown from $82 billion in 2016 to an estimated $138 billion in 2022, or at a 9.1% compounded annual growth rate (“CAGR”) over that time. Packaged Facts projects the U.S. pet market to grow at a CAGR of over 6.9% from 2022 through 2026, with retail pet food and treats projected to grow at a CAGR of over 6.5% over that time. 
Consistency of spending and resilience during economic downturns
Spending on pets is a necessity and most customers purchase frequently and at regular intervals. The pet industry is one of the most resilient categories during economic downturns because of the nature of the pet parent/pet relationship. For example, during the recession from 2008 to 2010, overall consumer spending in the U.S. declined while pet spending in the U.S. increased by 12%, according to the American Pet Products Association (the “APPA”). In 2010 alone, spending in the U.S. on entertainment decreased by 7.0%, food decreased by 3.8%, housing decreased by 2.0% and apparel and services decreased by 1.4%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, while spending on pets increased by 6.2%, according to the APPA.
Similar to the resiliency shown during the 2008 to 2010 recession, the pet industry experienced a significant increase in demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic despite the overall economic downturn, particularly within the e-commerce channel. Pet adoptions and fostering surged with “stay-at-home” orders further increasing demand and the continued humanization of pets. According to Packaged Facts, only 5% of dog and cat owners agreed that they were spending less on pet food as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent economic downturn. Further, 34% of these individuals indicated a significant shift in “where or how” they bought pet products in 2020, which has resulted in a reduction in brick-and-mortar shopping and an increase in online shopping. 
According to Packaged Facts, 68% of consumers have been cutting back on household expenses in the last 12 months due to price inflation, economic uncertainty, or other factors. However, only 15% of consumers cutting back are doing so in pet care and human medical care categories. 
Rapid shift to online shopping, with significant remaining opportunity
The pet industry, like many other industries in the U.S., is experiencing a continued shift from in-store to online purchases and it appears that this migration has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, with tailwinds expected to continue for several years. In 2019, e-commerce claimed the top spot of pet food sales by channel and online shopping continues to take market share from brick-and-mortar retail. Packaged Facts reports that online shopping grew from 16% of U.S. retail pet product sales in 2017 to an estimated 38% in 2022 with over $21 billion of pet food and treats sold online. This represents an over 32% CAGR for online pet retail over that time frame. Packaged Facts estimates the e-commerce channel to rapidly increase to 48% of total retail channel pet product sales by 2026, while all other channels are projected to decline. This shift to e-commerce nearly doubles estimates of 25% channel share in 2019, pre-COVID. In fact, the share of pet-owning households who buy pet food online nearly tripled from 16% in the Fall 2019 tracking period to 48% as of Summer 2022, according to MRI-Simmons data cited by Packaged Facts. We believe that the secular trend toward online shopping will continue for a significant period as consumers look to benefit from the convenience of home delivery and subscription-based purchasing, and the heightened safety of a “contactless” shopping experience. 
Growing trend of subscription-based purchasing
Additionally Packaged Facts research indicates that 58% of pet owners utilize subscription-based purchasing for pet products, such as pet food, treats, litter, and flea/tick or heartworm medications in 2022. According to Packaged Facts, 22% of pet parents surveyed in January 2023 used subscription-based purchasing for pet food in the prior 12 months, which was up from 12% in February 2020. Similarly, 21% of treat purchases were subscription-based, up from 15% the previous year. This method has become significantly more popular among consumers born between 1965 and 2020, who are increasingly becoming pet parents. Packaged Facts found that usage rates for any type of pet product or service subscription are dramatically higher for Millennials/Gen Zers (71%) or Gen Xers (55%) than for Boomers or older seniors (34%). We believe that the trend of increased subscription-based purchasing behavior within the broader secular trend toward online shopping supports higher levels of customer retention and revenue visibility.
Our Strengths 
•Chewy’s commitment to customer service is the core of our brand. 
◦Customer centricity. Everything about our company is organized around our commitment to provide an exceptional customer experience. We make the shopping experience easy and enjoyable, and that makes finding and buying the right product an amazing start to the customer journey. We provide competitive prices, customizable and convenient automatic reordering, fast and reliable order delivery, and innovative technology-driven services. 
◦Customer service expertise that is knowledgeable and empowered. Our customer service representatives (“CSRs”) share a common bond - they love pets. This shared passion is evident in every interaction they have with our customers, whether via phone, email, or interactive live-chat. In addition, contacting us is easy, with virtually all customer calls being answered in less than ten seconds. From the moment they join Chewy, our CSRs receive extensive training from our knowledgeable team, learning the ins and outs of the world of pets and our product offering. Thereafter, they continue learning about brands and pets of all types via recurring training. This allows them to further hone their ability to deliver highly specialized, informed, and authentic advice to our customers.
◦Engaging with customers on a personalized level. We empower our CSRs to go above and beyond for our customers, and they do so with the knowledge that our commitment to our customers is our number one priority. We engage with pet parents thousands of times per day, and we embrace the opportunity to “WOW” our customers each time, from surprising them with a hand-painted pet portrait to sending flowers to a family who has recently lost their pet. In addition, we have developed integrated technology that enables us to capture personalized profiles for each of our customers as well as their pets so that we may provide them with personalized recommendations. The expertise of our CSRs, combined with the powerful tools that we provide them, allows us to deliver a high-touch and high-quality experience to our customers, which we believe results in higher retention rates. 
•We offer a wide assortment of pet products and services—and we continue to grow that assortment—which we offer at competitive prices. We carry more than 3,500 carefully selected brands, representing many of the best and most popular products, and we regularly add new ones as we strive to offer everything that pet parents may need or want for their pets. In addition, we offer a wide range of free educational media (such as blogs, videos, and tutorials on our website, Be.Chewy.com) to enhance our product offering and the buying experience, helping pet parents choose the right product for their pet or find answers to commonly asked questions specific to their type of pet. In 2020, we launched a medication compounding and telehealth service, “Connect with a Vet.” In 2021, we expanded access to “Connect with a Vet” to all Chewy customers, with access remaining free of charge for our Autoship customers. In 2022, we further expanded this access to all registered Chewy customers, with access remaining free of charge. In 2022, we also launched Careplus, a product suite of Insurance and Wellness plans across price points and coverage options with our goal to increase pet parents’ access to affordable and high-quality healthcare offerings for their pets.
•Our highly efficient and effective distribution network provides exceptional delivery with ongoing cost advantages and superior customer service. The strategic placement of our fulfillment centers across the U.S. provides us the capability to cost-efficiently ship to over 80% of the U.S. population overnight and almost 100% in two days. The high volume of our sales, high participation rate in our Autoship subscription program, and relatively low seasonality of our business allow us to optimize asset utilization across our network and lower our fixed and variable cost per unit and our inventory levels.
•We deploy capital efficiently. We invest cash flow generated from our existing customer base to attract new customers and scale our platforms and fulfillment processes. Given the fast and consistent payback levels from our customers, we invest free cash flow in marketing to attract new customers. Additionally, we expect to continue to invest in technology and product innovation to continue scaling our platform, customer support, marketing efforts, and supply chain in order to drive growth and profitability. 
•Our technology platform is scalable. Our advanced technology platform was developed to enable us to grow our sales volume and increase the number of active customers while reducing marginal transaction and operational costs. Given the significant fixed-cost component of our technology platform, we expect that our cost per transaction will continue to decrease as our sales volume grows. The scalability and integrated nature of our technology platform also allow us to run our operations in a cost-efficient manner by decreasing the number of operational personnel and automating many of our planning and fulfillment processes. For example, we have significantly improved our processes for picking and packing orders through better forecasting, inventory placement, and optimal labor planning, as well as investing in automated fulfillment processes. Our customer service model, while “high touch,” provides our CSRs with up-to-date customer data and cutting-edge tools to optimize their productivity. As we continue to grow, we expect that we will be able to further scale our fixed costs. Examples of our scalable technology include our rollout of Practice Hub in 2021, an e-commerce solution for veterinarians that allows them to integrate their existing practice management software with our fulfillment and customer service capabilities, and our beta version of sponsored ads in 2022, which are dedicated product placements on Chewy.com that promote specific products from select vendors. We believe sponsored ads will enable us to scale contextual advertisements, which in turn should deliver highly relevant products to customers and high-margin revenue to our business.
Our Strategy
•Continue to grow sales from our existing customer base. We seek to expand our share of our customers’ wallets by broadening the selection of products and services that we offer as well as improving customer engagement. Customers have historically spent more per purchase on our website and mobile applications after their first year as they discover the wide range of our product and service offering and the value proposition we provide. Our exceptional customer service and “WOW” programs help us retain customers and increase their level of engagement and spending. 
•Acquire new customers. We intend to increase brand awareness and reach new customers by investing free cash flow from our existing customer base in advertising and marketing to acquire new customers from existing and new channels. Given the high levels of customer satisfaction that we see from our customers, we believe that there is significant opportunity to grow our business as consumers become more aware of our brand and our strong value proposition.
•Leverage our technological and operational efficiencies. We believe that we can further improve our margins as we grow net sales, and we remain committed to achieving this. We expect to invest in technology, automation, and product innovation over time to continue scaling our platform, customer support, marketing efforts and supply chain. Our management team is committed to a disciplined use of capital designed to drive measurable improvements in unit economics and further improve our profitability. 
•Continue to grow our private brands. In 2016, we launched our first hardgoods private brand, Frisco, followed by the launch of two consumables private brands, American Journey and Tylee’s. Millions of customers have tried and reordered at least one of our private brands over the years. Our goal is to provide value to our customers by offering private brands with compelling quality and pricing. In 2022, we launched Vibeful, our first private brand in the pet wellness category, featuring products ranging from multivitamins to hip and joint supplements. We believe there is significant room to grow our private brands through continued growth of our current brands and the launch of new ones.
•Expand further into pet healthcare. We provide customers with what we believe is a one-stop shop for their prescription and special diet needs with our over-the-counter and veterinarian diet offerings and Chewy Pharmacy products. In recent years, we have expanded our products and services to advance our mission to be the most trusted resource for pet parents and veterinarians alike, and to make pet healthcare more affordable and accessible to pet parents. We believe that we share a common goal of pet health and wellness with the veterinarian community, and we will continue to utilize our strengths to enhance partnerships with customers and veterinarians alike. In 2020, we launched “Connect with a Vet,” a telehealth service that allows pet parents to connect directly with licensed veterinarians for pet care, and in 2021, we expanded paid access to all customers with continued complimentary access for our Autoship customers, and in 2022 we expanded complimentary access to all registered customers. In 2020, we also offered customers the ability to order compounding medications in the form of customized, pharmaceutical grade, prescription medications that meet their pets’ unique needs. In 2021, we launched Practice Hub, a complete e-commerce solution for veterinarians that can integrate with their existing management software, manage preapproved prescriptions, and enable practices to earn revenue with Chewy while we handle inventory, fulfillment, shipping, and customer service. As of today, we have over 1,000 veterinary practices using the platform, an increase from approximately 300 in early 2022. In 2022, we launched and expanded the CarePlus product suite of Insurance and Wellness plans to provide diversified offerings across price points and coverage options. As of January 29, 2023, we have expanded into over 30 States, with a target nationwide launch of Lemonade offerings in spring of 2023. In 2022, we also completed our acquisition of Petabyte Technology Inc. (“Petabyte”), a provider of cloud-based technology solutions to the veterinary sector, and the acquisition is expected to further strengthen the Company’s pet healthcare product and service offering.
•Explore broader platform opportunities. We believe that there are additional pet offerings that can drive future growth and that our platform extends strong complementarities to other categories such as pet services, should we choose to do so. The strengths of our platform may enable us to sell directly to businesses in addition to consumers. Finally, although we have exclusively focused on sales in the U.S. to date, we may expand our offering internationally in the future.
Customers and Markets 
We serve customers through our website and mobile applications and focus on delivering the best products with the best service at competitive prices. We operate customer service centers 24/7 to serve our customers every single day of the year.
Competition 
The pet products and services industry is highly competitive and can be organized into the following categories: internet (including online sales by omnichannel players); pet specialty stores; mass merchandisers/discount stores/supercenters; food stores; wholesale clubs; farm/feed stores; independent pet channel; dollar stores; drug stores; natural food; and veterinary.
Competition in the pet products and services industry is strong, particularly within the e-commerce channel as the industry continues to experience a secular shift from in-store to online shopping. We face competition from the websites of our competitors such as other online retailers, online sales for omnichannel retailers, our suppliers’ own websites, and traditional brick and mortar retailers as well as those in the veterinary channel. Some of the principal competitive factors influencing our business are price, product selection and availability, fast and reliable delivery, and customer service. We believe our ability to provide a seamless shopping experience, fast and reliable delivery options, including our convenient Autoship subscription program, and our knowledgeable customer service sets us apart from our competitors.
Trademarks and Intellectual Property
Our rights in our intellectual property, including trademarks, patents, trade secrets, copyrights and domain names, as well as contractual provisions and restrictions on use of our intellectual property, are important to our business. For example, our trademark rights assist in our marketing efforts to develop brand recognition and differentiate our brands from our competitors. We own a number of trademark registrations and applications in the U.S. and in certain foreign jurisdictions. These trademarks include, among others, “American Journey,” “Blue Box Event,” “Careplus,” “Chewy,” “Chewy.com,” “Dr. Lyon’s,” “Frisco,” “Goody Box,” “Onguard,” “PetMD,” “Practice Hub,” “Tiny Tiger,” “True Acre Farms,” “Tylee’s,” and “Vibeful.” The current registrations of these trademarks are effective for varying periods of time and may be renewed periodically, provided that we, as the registered owner, or our licensees where applicable, comply with all applicable renewal requirements including, where necessary, the continued use of the trademarks in connection with similar goods and services. We expect to pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe they would be beneficial to protecting our rights.
We also own numerous domain names in connection with our business, including www.chewy.com. We also enter into, and rely on, confidentiality, proprietary rights, and other agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors, agents, and business partners to secure our ownership and protect our intellectual property, trade secrets, proprietary technology and other confidential information. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and ownership of our intellectual property through provisions in both our customer terms of use and in our vendor terms and conditions. Further, we enter into agreements that include provisions that protect our intellectual property with manufacturers to develop and market pet products in connection with our private brands.
We believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has significantly contributed to our success to date. 
Seasonality 
Seasonality in our business does not follow that of traditional retailers, such as typically high concentration of revenue in the holiday quarter. Our net sales tend to grow throughout the fiscal year as we continue to acquire additional new customers and they continue to purchase from us. We recognized 24%, 24%, 25%, and 27% of our annual net sales during the first, second, third, and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2022, respectively.
Human Capital
Our employees are critical to us fulfilling our mission of being the most trusted and convenient destination for pet parents and partners everywhere. We accomplish this, in part, by recruiting, hiring, training, and motivating employees who share our core values of delivering superior customer service and caring about the needs of pets and their parents. To continue our mission, and to compete and succeed in our highly competitive and rapidly evolving market, it is crucial that we continue to attract, develop, engage, and retain well-qualified employees. We face significant competition for employees, which has increased as a result of constrained labor markets. We strive to offer competitive compensation and benefits, focus on employee safety, share opportunities for positive societal impact through participation in philanthropic endeavors, and foster a workplace that is reflective of our society and where everyone feels empowered to do their best work.
We employed approximately 19,400 full-time and part-time employees as of January 29, 2023. Additionally, we use independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce, primarily to support our corporate operations and information technology staff. As of March 15, 2023, none of our employees were represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We provide our employees with support resources and programs that advance employee engagement, communication, and feedback, such as an annual engagement survey and quarterly pulse surveys, which we use to assess and improve our practices and policies. We also invest in the education, training, and development of employees by providing learning opportunities through various courses and programs and our internal custom learning platform, Chewy University.
Compensation and Benefits Program. Our compensation and benefits are designed to enable us to attract, motivate, and retain highly-qualified talent. We offer market-competitive compensation and benefits including life and health (medical, dental, and vision) insurance, health savings accounts, paid time off, paid parental leave, family support services (including child adoption and surrogacy benefits and pet adoption reimbursement), a 401(k) plan, and a discount off purchases made on Chewy.com. We offer our employees opportunities to advance their careers and are passionate about providing employees with skills and development opportunities to meet the needs of our customers and the development of our business. We also offer our corporate employees “Paw-ternity” leave, allowing them to work from home for the first two weeks after a new dog is brought into their home.
Team Member Safety. We are committed to the health and safety of our employees. During fiscal year 2022, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we continued to take proactive and precautionary steps to protect the health and safety of our employees. In addition, during fiscal year 2022, we continued to offer emergency sick pay and additional paid time off for hourly employees for absences related to COVID-19 and encouraged employees to obtain influenza and COVID-19 vaccinations. We also provide several channels for all employees to speak up, ask for guidance, and report concerns related to ethics or safety violations, and offer certain webinars and subscriptions to support our employees’ health and well-being.
Community Involvement. Our Chewy Gives Back team works tirelessly at continuing our philanthropic mission of supporting animal shelters and rescues everywhere. During the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023, we donated approximately $50 million in products and supplies to animal shelters and rescues. 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. We recognize the importance of a diverse and inclusive workforce and fostering safe working environments in which our employees can be their authentic and best selves. Our diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) mission is to hire, retain, and promote exceptional talent that values and is inclusive of diverse backgrounds and perspectives. We are focused on this mission and on building an inclusive culture through a variety of diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and programs, including assessments of current processes and policies. During fiscal year 2022, we continued company-wide unconscious bias training, expanded our DEI course offerings, and provided five team member resource groups in support of our DEI mission.
