Item 1.  Business
Overview
 Lifeloc Technologies, Inc., a Colorado corporation ("Lifeloc" or the "Company"), is a Colorado-based developer, manufacturer and marketer of portable hand-held and fixed station breathalyzers and related accessories, supplies and education.  We design, produce and sell fuel-cell based breath alcohol testing equipment.  We compete in all major segments of the portable breath alcohol testing instrument market, including law enforcement, workplace, corrections, original equipment manufacturing ("OEM") and consumer markets. In addition, we offer a line of supplies, accessories, services, and training to support customers' alcohol testing programs. We sell globally through distributors as well as directly to users.
 We define our business as providing "near and remote sensing" products and solutions. Today, the majority of our revenues are derived from products and services for alcohol detection and measurement. We remain committed to growing our breath alcohol testing business. In the future, we anticipate the commercialization of new sensing and measurement products that may allow Lifeloc to successfully expand our business into new growth areas where we do not presently compete or where no satisfactory product solutions exist today. 
 In addition, with the October 2014 purchase of our corporate headquarters and certain adjacent property, we added a new reporting segment focused on the ownership and rental of real property through existing commercial leases.
 Lifeloc incorporated in Colorado in December 1983.  We filed a registration statement on Form 10 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which became effective on May 31, 2011.  Our fiscal year end is December 31.  Our principal executive offices are located at 12441 West 49th Avenue, Unit 4, Wheat Ridge, Colorado 80033-3338.  Our telephone number is (303) 431-9500.  Our websites are www.lifeloc.com and www.stsfirst.com. Information contained on our websites does not constitute part of this Form 10-K.

Principal Products and Services and Methods of Distribution
 Alcohol Breath Testers 
 In 1989, we introduced our first breath alcohol tester, the PBA3000. Our Phoenix® Classic was completed and released for sale in1998, superseding the PBA3000. In turn, the Phoenix® Classic has been superseded by our FC Series and Workplace Series of portable breath alcohol testers, which are discussed below. Neither the PBA3000 nor the Phoenix® Classic is actively sold today
  In 2001, we completed and released for sale our new FC Series, designed specifically for domestic and international law enforcement and corrections markets. The portable breath alcohol testers comprising our FC Series are currently being sold worldwide, having contributed to our growth since their introduction. The FC Series is designed to meet the needs of domestic and international law enforcement for roadside drink/drive testing and alcohol offender monitoring. The FC Series is approved by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) as an evidential breath tester, making it suitable for sale to state law enforcement agencies for preliminary roadside breath alcohol testing.  The FC Series is routinely updated with firmware, software and component improvements as they become available.  It is readily adaptable to the specific requirements and regulations of domestic and international markets.
 In 2005 and 2006, we introduced two new models, the EV30 and Phoenix® 6.0 Evidential Breath Tester (“Phoenix® 6.0”), which constitute our Workplace Series of testing devices.  Like their predecessor, the Phoenix® Classic, and our FC Series, these instruments are DOT approved. The DOT’s specifications support the DOT’s workplace alcohol testing programs, including those applicable to workplace alcohol testing for the federally regulated transportation industry. We also sell component parts used in alcohol testing devices, such as mouthpieces used by our breathalyzers, as well as forms and labels used for record keeping, and calibration products for user re-calibration of our devices.  We offer optional service agreements on our equipment, re-calibration services, and spare parts, and we sell supporting instrument training and user certification training to our workplace customers.
 In 2006, we commenced selling breath alcohol equipment components that we manufacture to other OEMs for inclusion as subassemblies or components in their breath alcohol testing devices.
 In late 2009, Lifeloc released the LifeGuard Personal Breathalyzer (“LifeGuard”), a personal alcohol breath tester that incorporates the same fuel-cell technology used in our professional devices. Intended originally for the global consumer breathalyzer market, LifeGuard was phased out in 2018.

In 2011 and 2012, Lifeloc introduced Bluetooth wireless keyboard and printer communication options for our Phoenix® 6.0 along with a series of web based workplace training courses. We believe these two product innovations have been key to our success and leadership in workplace breath testing.
 In 2013, Lifeloc expanded our FC Series of professional breath alcohol testers targeted at domestic and international law enforcement and corrections markets with the addition of the FC5 Hornet (the “FC5”). The FC5 is a passive (no mouthpieces required) portable handheld alcohol screening device that competes directly with passive alcohol screeners from our competitors in the education, law enforcement, workplace and corrections markets.
 In 2013, we also introduced the Sentinel™ zero tolerance alcohol screening station, a fully automated wall mounted screening station for use in safety sensitive industries such as oil and gas and mining. Both devices expand Lifeloc’s products for passive alcohol screening.
 In the third quarter of 2014, we received approval from DOT for our EASYCAL® automatic calibration station for use with our Phoenix ® 6.0 Evidential Breath Testers, and we began shipments of the EASYCAL® to our law enforcement, corrections, workplace and international customers.   The EASYCAL® calibration station is a first of its kind device that automatically performs breath tester instrument calibration, calibration verification and gas management.  As compared to manual instrument calibration, the EASYCAL® reduces the opportunity for human error, saves time and reduces operating costs.  In May 2019, we received DOT approval on a second generation EASYCAL® with broader capabilities called the EASYCAL® G2.
 In October 2015, we expanded our Sentinel™ line with the Sentinel™ VA alcohol screening station, a fully automated station to control vehicular access to safety critical facilities, such as mines, refineries, power stations and nuclear facilities.  The Sentinel™ VA alcohol screening station is intended to allow all drivers entering a secure area to be tested quickly and efficiently without leaving their vehicle.
 In November 2019, we received approval from DOT for our LX9 and LT7 base unit alcohol breathalyzers. Both have been updated and both updated versions received DOT approval in December 2021.
 Testers for Drugs of Abuse
 In August 2016, we entered into an exclusive patent license agreement with Sandia Corporation, Albuquerque, NM, pursuant to which we acquired the exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and market Sandia’s patented SpinDx™ technology for the detection of drugs of abuse. SpinDx™ uses a centrifugal disk with micro fluidic flow paths allowing multiple tests to be carried out on a single small sample.  The microfluidics disk with centrifugal concentration achieves a strong signal from trace concentrations in small samples that under best conditions can be quantitative. Sandia Corporation developed a prototype using the SpinDx™ technology under our Cooperative Research and Development Agreement. We received the first prototype in 2018, advanced this device for robustness and manufacturability, and are now commercializing the device. In 2022 and 2021 we purchased SpinDx related test validation equipment as well as disk development fabrication equipment totaling $23,999 and $265,867 respectively. We are optimistic about the results of the work to date and expect market introduction later in 2022 with partners for field demonstration. The SpinDx™ platform has the potential to improve real-time screening for a panel of high-abuse drugs, with the ability to efficiently measure relatively low concentrations of drugs such as cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, fentanyl and other high-abuse drugs.  We intend to use this technology platform, sometimes referred to as “Lab on a Disk", to develop a series of devices and tests that could be used at roadside, emergency rooms and in workplace testing to get a rapid and quantitative measure for a panel of such drugs of abuse. First will be the SpinDx device with disks for delta-9 THC detection from an oral fluid sample collected from a test subject. This will be followed with a device based on our recently updated LX9 breathalyzer to collect a sample for analysis from breath, which coupled with the SpinDx device will be our marijuana breathalyzer system.  We have detected delta-9-THC (the primary psychoactive component of marijuana) down to concentrations of 5 nanograms per milliliter in our laboratory.  This includes resolving the psychoactive delta-9-THC from its inactive metabolites, an important step in establishing impairment. Testing has commenced to validate the SpinDx technology against the definitive standard liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LCMS) measurement utilizing human samples. The SpinDx results are showing good correlation to the LCMS data. There is no assurance that our efforts to develop a marijuana breathalyzer will be successful or that significant sales will result from such development if successful.
 In March 2017 we acquired substantially all of the assets related to the Real-time Alcohol Detection and Reporting product (“R.A.D.A.R.®”) from Track Group, Inc. (“TRCK”) for $860,000 in cash.  The purchased assets included the R.A.D.A.R.® device with cellular reporting for real-time alcohol monitoring, database infrastructure to tabulate and manage subscriber behavior, and biometric methodology and intellectual property to fully automate identity verification.  The R.A.D.A.R.® device was designed to be part of an offender supervision program as an alternative to incarceration, and it is assigned to offenders as a condition of parole or probation with random testing throughout the day to demonstrate that they are meeting the conditions of their sentence. The R.A.D.A.R.® 200 Mobile Device has been updated and released for sale in 2022. Continued refinements are needed, which, when completed, we expect to result in R.A.D.A.R. 300 having the ability to confirm that the user blowing the alcohol test is the correct user, along with other features.

 On June 1, 2022, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Probation Tracker, Inc., a Colorado corporation (“PTI”) and capitalized it with $61,353 in exchange for 613,530 shares of PTI common stock. PTI had no activity during the three months ended September 30, 2022. In August 2022, we filed a Form 10 with the Securities and Exchange Commission in anticipation of distributing all of the 613,530 shares of common stock to our shareholders as a stock dividend. In September, 2022, this Form 10 was withdrawn, and the plan to distribute the PTI shares was canceled. The $61,353 of cash was withdrawn and PTI was deactivated. We have entered into a consulting agreement with a third party to work on developing a proof of concept showing that R.A.D.A.R. 300 is feasible.
 Training
 Drug and alcohol testing is highly regulated; thus quality training is an important component of our business.  Initially, our network of Master Trainers provided classroom training which generated certification fees.  This was expanded to include instructor materials, online training modules and direct (live) training via webcam.  In 2011, we launched Lifeloc University, a Learning Management System (LMS), defined as "a software application for the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting and delivery of educational courses or training programs." Lifeloc University is a critical component for online training courses since it provides student accountability.  The Lifeloc University LMS was updated in 2018 to provide responsive design so it could be viewed on mobile devices and was updated in 2021 to reflect DOT rule and other changes.
 In December 2014, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Superior Training Solutions, Inc. (“STS”), a company that develops and sells online drug and alcohol training and refresher courses. We have augmented and updated the assets we acquired from STS to enable mobile device usage. These assets complement our existing drug and alcohol training courses.
 Real Property
 On October 31, 2014, we purchased the commercial property we use as our corporate headquarters and certain adjacent property in Wheat Ridge, Colorado.  The building consists of 22,325 square feet, of which 14,412 square feet are occupied by us and 7,913 square feet are currently leased to two tenants whose leases expire at various times until September 30, 2023. We intend to continue to lease the space we are not occupying, but in the future may elect to expand our own operations into space currently leased to other tenants.  Our purchase of the property was partially financed through a term loan in an original principal amount of $1,581,106, secured by a first-priority mortgage on the property. This loan was paid on September 30, 2021 with proceeds from a new term loan, also secured by a first-priority mortgage on the property, in the principal amount of $1,350,000 which matures in September, 2031.
Additional Areas of Interest
 Consistent with our business goal of providing “near and remote sensing and monitoring” products and solutions, our acquisition strategy involves purchasing companies, development resources and assets that are aligned with our areas of interest and that can further aid in our entering additional markets.  We expect to actively research and engage in the acquisition of resources that can expedite our entrance into new markets or strengthen our position in existing ones.
Competition and Markets
 
We sell our products in a highly competitive market and we compete for business with both foreign and domestic manufacturers.  Most of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do.  In addition, there is an ongoing risk that other domestic or foreign companies who do not currently service or manufacture products for our target markets may seek to produce products or services that compete directly with ours.
 
We believe that considerations regarding competition for sales of alcohol monitoring products and services include regulatory approvals, product performance, product delivery, quality, service, training, price, device reliability, ease of use and speed.  We sell certain of our components to customers for incorporation into their own product lines and for resale under their own name.  We believe that, while our resources are more limited than those of our competitors, we will continue to compete successfully on the basis of product innovation, quality, reputation and continued customer service excellence.
 
One of our leading competitors is Intoximeters, Inc. of St. Louis, Missouri, a long-established company with strong name recognition in the field of alcohol testing.  It has well-established sales channels, a large customer base, and a broad product line.  CMI, Inc. of Owensboro, Kentucky, another major competitor, also has a well-established name, a strong position in stationary units used in police work, and international market coverage.  Drägerwerk AG & Co. KGaA, based in Germany, manufactures safety and gas testing equipment.  Its breath alcohol testers are respected for their quality and performance.

In addition, other technologies for the measurement of breath alcohol exist and are employed in other market and application segments where the technology may be more suitable or developed to specific requirements. These include:
 

• | Infrared devices, which use infrared light absorption to detect breath alcohol. These devices generally lack portability, and are usually found in fixed locations, such as police stations, where subjects are brought for testing. This technology has the advantage of being mandated by law in most states for evidential use in breath testing.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Semiconductor breath testing technology, which is used primarily in consumer breathalyzers. Its primary advantage is low cost, but the technology is not widely accepted by professional users as being as accurate as fuel cell technology.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Chemical tests, which are based on urine and saliva testing. This approach to alcohol testing is more invasive, less convenient than breath testing, and may require subsequent analysis for results. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Blood alcohol tests, which require blood samples. These tests are widely believed to be the most accurate form of alcohol testing because they measure blood alcohol content directly from a sample of the subject's blood. However, the results are not instantaneous, and the tests are more invasive and expensive than breath alcohol testing. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marketing
 
Marketing activities associated with our business include the communication of our value proposition through direct mail, direct and indirect sales channels, trade shows and an information-rich online presence.  We sell our products to the workplace and international markets primarily through distributors.  We sell our law enforcement, corrections and consumer products directly to the end user and our OEM products directly to manufacturers. Leveraging our installed base is important, as is maintaining a well-trained distributor network.  In 2009, we revised our workplace distributor program to place additional emphasis on volume incentives for growth in the form of a rebate program.  Under the program, qualifying distributors receive a progressively greater percentage rebate based on the dollar sales they generate. We believe this program helps incentivize our distributors to achieve a higher level of sales than would otherwise be the case.
Domestic Distribution
 
The majority of our sales into the workplace market are made through distributors.  Sales are made by these distributors pursuant to agreements that renew automatically each year unless terminated by either party with advance notice, and such agreements typically grant protected lead generation areas.
International Distribution
 
Over 90% of our international sales for all product lines are made by local distributors, who are given territories generally pursuant to agreements that renew automatically each year unless terminated by either party with advance notice.  Based on reports from our international distributors, we believe that many countries around the world are instituting tougher alcohol abuse prevention laws, strengthening the enforcement of current laws, or both. These laws set limits on the amount of alcohol an individual may have in the blood at specific times (e.g., while driving or during safety-sensitive work activities), or at any time for certain parolees and probationers.  Lifeloc has sold instruments to customers in over 65 countries on six continents worldwide.
Research and Development
 
Lifeloc defines its business broadly to include "near and remote sensing and monitoring" applications in markets including those outside of traditional alcohol testing.  We believe that our future success depends to a large degree on our ability to conceive and develop improved alcohol detection and measurement products, as well as to identify attractive opportunities for growth outside of breath alcohol testing.  Accordingly, we expect to continue to invest in research and development.  We spent $1,385,927 and $1,213,482 during 2022 and 2021, respectively, on research and development, and on sustaining engineering. The amount spent in 2022 was $172,445 higher than the amount spent in 2021 due primarily to dedicating resources to commercializing SpinDx. We expect to continue to increase our emphasis on new product development efforts for existing and new markets with particular emphasis on developing the SpinDx™ technology.

Raw Materials and Principal Suppliers
 
A basic component of our instrument product line is the fuel cell, which we obtain from only a few suppliers.  We believe that our demand for this component is small relative to the total supply, and that the materials and services required for the production of our products are currently available in sufficient quantities and will be available for the foreseeable future.  However, there are relatively few suppliers of the high-quality fuel cells which our breathalyzers require.  Any sudden disruption to the supply of our fuel cells would pose a significant risk to our business. New sources of fuel cells are uncertain at this time and changes to our fuel cells require approval by the DOT, which, if not received, could have a material effect on our revenues.  While we have traditionally used only one supplier of fuel cells, we completed development of our own fuel cell assembly capability, using purchased sensors, in 2018. These Lifeloc-assembled fuel cells have been incorporated into breathalyzers which have been submitted to and approved by the Department of Transportation. Even with the approval of our own assembled fuel cells, we continue to purchase a portion of our total fuel cell requirements from our current supplier as necessary to meet the needs of the Company.
 
Supply chain disruptions experienced in 2022 have forced us to maintain larger inventories of certain items in order to accommodate longer lead times, particularly components sourced internationally.
 
Patents, Intellectual Property and Royalties
 
We rely, in part, upon patents, trade secrets and proprietary knowledge as well as personnel policies and employee confidentiality agreements concerning inventions and other creative efforts (collectively, "Lifeloc IP") to develop and to maintain our competitive position. We do not believe that our business is dependent upon any patent, patent pending or license, although we believe that trade secrets and confidential know-how may be important to our commercial success.  
 
We file for patents, copyrights and trademarks to protect our intellectual property rights to the extent practicable.  We hold the rights to six United States patents and have two United States patent applications pending or in preparation for filing, along with international patent applications on our portable breath alcohol testers and on certain R.A.D.A.R.® assets. One international application was granted in 2022.  These patents have expiration dates ranging from May 2024 to July 2035. In 2017, we acquired seven United States patents and several active international patent applications in connection with our purchase of the R.A.D.A.R.® assets. The R.A.D.A.R.® patents and patent applications provide protection around the biometric identification methods used in the R.A.D.A.R.® devices along with a removable sampling chamber for maximum hygienics. We act to protect our patents from infringement in each instance where we determine that doing so would be economical in light of the expense involved and the level and availability of our financial resources.  While we believe that each of our pending applications relate to a patentable device or concept, there is no guarantee that the patents will be issued.
 
We also enter into royalty and licensing agreements where we license or otherwise confer our intellectual property rights on a licensor in exchange for specified payment terms. In 2012 we entered into a royalty agreement with an OEM customer which provides for the monthly payment of royalties to us on all products containing certain of our software sold by our customer.  The agreement is of perpetual duration, but is terminable by the OEM customer upon six months' notice. In 2013 we began receiving royalties from another customer as a result of entering into a second royalty agreement, which provides for the monthly payment of royalties to us on all products containing certain of our software sold by our customer. The agreement is of perpetual duration, but is terminable by the customer upon six months' notice or by us upon 12 months’ notice.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 35 full-time employees and 2 part-time employees.  We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. 
 
Customers
 
Revenues from our largest customers, as a percentage of total revenues, for 2022 and 2021 were as follows:

Environmental Matters
 
Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to the protection of the environment.  Lifeloc sells cylinders of ethanol in nitrogen (UN1956, Class 2.2) for use in calibrating breath alcohol testers. The gas mixture is a hazardous material as defined by the DOT (see 49 CFR 172). We believe we are in substantial compliance with the appropriate DOT regulations for the handling and shipment of dry gas containers, as well as all other state or local laws governing the transportation of hazardous materials. The DOT regulations include strict labeling and packaging requirements, as well as requirements pertaining to shipping papers and declaration forms that must be completed by the shipper.  In addition, we provide a Safety Data Sheet ("SDS") with every tank, and all employees involved in shipping hazardous materials are required to have appropriate certification.   Failure to comply with these regulations could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability, which could have a material impact on our business. The cost of complying with these regulations is considered as an ongoing cost of operations, and is not material.
 
Government Regulation of the Business
 All breath testers manufactured in the United States explicitly for personal use are regulated as Class I medical devices by the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"). We are subject to inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with these regulations.  FDA inspections are conducted periodically at the discretion of the FDA. 
 In connection with its distribution of cylinders of ethanol in nitrogen for use in calibrating breath alcohol testers (described above under "—Environmental Matters"), Lifeloc has trained on and is following the requirements of OSHA's Hazardous Communications Standard of 2012 (referred to as "HazCom 2012"). Compliance with HazCom 2012 requires providing employee information and training, labeling of chemicals used by Lifeloc and updating MSDS to the new harmonized Safety Data Sheets ("SDS") as they become available. It also requires us to prepare and implement a hazard communication program to follow for workers potentially exposed to hazardous chemicals.
 We are also subject to regulation by the United States Department of Transportation ("DOT") and by various state departments of transportation.  The Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 requires drug and alcohol testing of safety-sensitive transportation employees in aviation, trucking, railroads, mass transit, pipelines, and other transportation industries. The DOT Office of Drug & Alcohol Policy & Compliance ("ODAPC") publishes, implements, and provides authoritative interpretations of these rules.  These regulations cover all transportation employers, safety-sensitive transportation employees, and service agents.  Manufacturers submit devices to the DOT for testing and approval.  Instruments are tested according to their model specifications and, if passed, included on the Conforming Products List of Evidential Breath Alcohol Measurement Devices (the "CPL") published periodically in the Federal Register.  Law enforcement applications also require that portable breath testing instruments be included on the CPL.  Lifeloc's FC10, FC10Plus, FC20, FC20BT, EV30, and Phoenix® 6.0 are included on the CPL. Lifeloc’s LX9 and LT7 have received conformance letters from the DOT and are expected to appear in the next publication of the CPL. 
 We believe that we were in substantial compliance with the regulations described above as of December 31, 2022 for our products sold into these markets and states.
