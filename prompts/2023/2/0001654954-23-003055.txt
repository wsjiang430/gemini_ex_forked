Item 1. Business.
General

BK Technologies Corporation (NYSE American: BKTI) (together with its wholly owned subsidiaries, “BK,” the “Company,” “we” or “us”) is a holding company that, through BK Technologies, Inc., its operating subsidiary, provides public safety grade communications products and services which make first responders safer and more efficient. All operating activities described herein are undertaken by our operating subsidiary.

In business for over 70 years, BK consists of two business units: Radio and SaaS.

The Radio business unit designs, manufactures and markets American-made wireless communications products consisting of two-way land mobile radios (“LMRs”). Two-way LMRs can be radios that are hand-held (portable) or installed in vehicles (mobile).

Generally, BK Technologies-branded products serve the government markets including but not limited to emergency response, public safety, homeland security and military customers of federal, state, and municipal government agencies, as well as various industrial and commercial enterprises. We believe that our products and solutions provide superior value by offering a high specification, ruggedized, durable, reliable, feature rich, Project 25 (“P25”) compliant radio at a lower cost relative to comparable offerings.

 The SaaS business unit focuses on delivering innovative, public safety smartphone applications which operate ubiquitously over the public cellular networks. Our BKRplay branded smartphone application offers multiple services which make the first responder safer and more efficient. When tethered to our radios, the combined solution offers an enhanced user experience with more unique capability which increases the sales reach of our radios.

 We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on October 24, 1997. We are the resulting corporation from the reincorporation merger of our predecessor, Adage, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation, which reincorporated from Pennsylvania to Nevada effective as of January 30, 1998. Effective on June 4, 2018, we changed our corporate name from “RELM Wireless Corporation” to “BK Technologies, Inc.”

On March 28, 2019, we implemented a holding company reorganization. The reorganization created a new holding company, BK Technologies Corporation, which became the new parent company of BK Technologies, Inc. BK Technologies Corporation’s only significant assets are the outstanding equity interests in BK Technologies, Inc. and any other future subsidiaries of BK Technologies Corporation. The holding company reorganization was intended to create a more efficient corporate structure and increase operational flexibility.

For the purpose of this report, references to “we” or the “Company” or our management or business at any period prior to the holding company reorganization (March 28, 2019) refer to those of BK Technologies, Inc. as the predecessor company and its subsidiaries and thereafter to those of BK Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries, except as otherwise specified or to the extent the context otherwise indicates.

Our principal executive offices are located at 7100 Technology Drive, West Melbourne, Florida 32904 and our telephone number is (321) 984-1414.

Significant Events 

During 2022, pursuant to our capital return program, we declared and paid three quarterly dividends. The dividends declared in April, June and September 2022 were $0.03 per share.

On December 17, 2021, a share repurchase program was authorized under which we may repurchase up to an aggregate of $5 million of its common shares. Share repurchases under this program were authorized to begin immediately. The program does not have an expiration date. Any repurchases would be funded using cash on hand and cash from operations. The actual timing, manner and number of shares repurchased under the program will be determined by management and the Board of Directors at their discretion, and will depend on several factors, including the market price of our common shares, general market and economic conditions, alternative investment opportunities, and other business considerations in accordance with applicable securities laws and exchange rules. The authorization of the share repurchase program does not require BK Technologies to acquire any particular number of shares and repurchases may be suspended or terminated at any time at our discretion.

On June 9, 2021, we closed a public offering of 4,249,250 shares of our common stock at a price of $3.00 per share, for net proceeds of $11,559,000 after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. The shares sold in the offering included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their over-allotment option to purchase up to 554,250 shares of common stock in addition to the 3,695,000 shares which the underwriters initially agreed to purchase. ThinkEquity, a division of Fordham Financial Management, Inc., acted as sole book-running manager for the offering. The net proceeds from the offering have been used primarily for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, capital expenditures, operational purposes, strategic investments and potential acquisitions in complementary businesses.

Industry Overview

LMR end user communications devices consist of hand-held (portable) and vehicle-mounted (mobile) two-way radios commonly used by the public safety sector (e.g., police, fire, and emergency medical responders), military and commercial business concerns (e.g., corporate disaster recovery, hotels, airports, farms, transportation service providers, and construction firms), and government agencies within the U.S. and abroad. LMR systems are constructed to meet an organization’s specific communications needs typically over an operating area which exceeds the direct mode (radio to radio) communications range. The cost of a complete LMR system can vary widely, depending on the size and configuration. Likewise, the cost of end user LMR radios can range from under $100 for a basic analog portable, to thousands of dollars for a fully featured P25 digital unit.

LMR systems are the most widely used and longest-used form of wireless dispatch communications in the U.S., having been first placed in service in 1921. LMR was initially used almost exclusively by law enforcement, and all radio communications were transmitted in an analog format. Analog transmissions typically consist of a voice or other signal modulated directly onto a continuous radio carrier wave. Over time, advances in technology decreased the cost of LMR products and increased their popularity and usage by businesses and other agencies. Responding to the growing usage, additional radio frequency spectrum was allocated by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) for LMR use.

More recently, growth of the LMR industry has been limited by several factors such as the maturity of markets, funding and budgets for government and public safety agencies, and limited availability of radio frequency spectrum, which hinders existing users in expanding their systems and potential new users from establishing new systems.

Years ago, as a result of the limited spectrum availability, the FCC mandated that new LMR equipment utilize technology that is more spectrum efficient. This effectively meant that the industry had to migrate to digital technology. Responding to the mandate, the Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-International (“APCO”), the National Association of State Technology Directors (“NASTD”), the United States (“U.S.”) Federal Government and the Telecommunications Industry Association (“TIA”), in concert with several LMR manufacturers, including BK, recommended a standard for digital LMR devices that would meet the FCC spectrum-efficiency requirements and provide solutions to several problems experienced primarily by public safety users. The standard is called Project 25 (“P25”). The primary objectives of P25 are to: (i) allow effective and reliable communication among users of compliant equipment, regardless of its manufacturer, known as interoperability, (ii) maximize radio spectrum efficiency and (iii) promote competition among LMR providers through an open system architecture.

Although the FCC does not require public safety agencies or any radio users to purchase P25 equipment or otherwise adopt the standard, compliance with the standard is a primary consideration for government and public safety purchasers. In addition, U.S. Federal Government grant programs that provide assistance in funding for state and local agencies to purchase interoperable communications equipment for first responders strongly encourage and often require compliance with the P25 standard. Accordingly, although funding for LMR purchases by many government agencies is limited, we believe that, as users upgrade and replace equipment, demand for P25 LMR equipment will continue to grow. Additionally, the P25 standard has also been widely adopted in other countries. The migration to P25 equipment is primarily limited to government and public safety agencies. Radio users in the business and industrial market utilize alternative digital technologies (e.g., Digital Mobile Radio) and analog LMR products.

Presently, the market is dominated by one supplier, Motorola Solutions, Inc., which offers a broader range of products than we do. However, the open architecture of the P25 standard is designed to eliminate the ability of one or more suppliers to lock out competitors.  Formerly, because of proprietary characteristics incorporated in many LMR systems, a customer was effectively precluded from purchasing additional LMR products from a supplier other than the initial supplier of the system.  Additionally, the system infrastructure technology was prohibitive for smaller suppliers to develop and implement.  P25 provides an environment in which users will increasingly have a wider selection of LMR suppliers, including smaller suppliers such as BK.

Today, public safety communications includes both LMR and cellular technologies.  LMR is typically used when mission critical or life safety voice communications is required or in direct mode (radio-to-radio) communications applications.  Cellular (LTE or 5G) is typically used to support broadband data applications in the field. Since the introduction of broadband data LTE cellular technology by US cellular carriers in 2010, the industry has seen a rapid growth of public safety mobile applications which have made the first responder safer and more efficient.   

As cellular coverage continues to improve terrestrially and soon from low earth orbit satellites, the opportunity to further extend mobile applications from public safety vehicles to the first responder’s smartphone opens a new era of services and opportunities.

Description of Radio Products and P25 CAP Compliance 

We offer products under the company brand name BK Technologies.  Our KNG Series and BKR Series radios operate in both the P25 digital and analog modes of operations in the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) licensed bands; very high frequency (“VHF”) (136MHz - 174MHz), ultra-high frequency (“UHF”) (380MHz - 470MHz, 450MHz - 520MHz), and 700-800 MHz bands.  

Our P25 digital technology is compliant with the Project 25 standard for digital LMR equipment.  P25 has been adopted by representatives from APCO, NASTD, the United States (“U.S.”) Federal Government and other public safety user organizations. 

The Department of Homeland Security’s P25 Compliance Assessment Program (“CAP”) is a voluntary program that allows LMR equipment suppliers to formally demonstrate their products’ compliance with P25 requirements.  The purpose of the program is to provide federal, state and local emergency response agencies with evidence that the communications equipment they are purchasing satisfies the P25 standard for performance, conformance and interoperability.  The program is a result of legislation passed by the U.S. Congress to improve communication interoperability for first responders and is a partnership of the U.S Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”)’s Command, Control and Interoperability Division, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”), radio equipment manufacturers and the emergency response community.

Both the KNG and BKR series radios have been validated under the CAP as being P25 compliant. 

Description of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) Offerings

BK’s first SaaS service, InteropONE, was introduced in October 2022 at the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) conference. InteropONE is a Push-to-talk-Over-Cellular (PTTOC) SaaS service which provides emergency incident commanders the capability to dynamically establish group push-to-talk communications between at-large smartphone users directly from their smartphone. There are several PTTOC services available today from cellular carriers and other service providers. While these services provide supplementary features and coverage to LMR networks, PTTOC subscribers to a specific service cannot communicate to PTTOC subscribers of another service provider without deployment of pre-configured, complex, and expensive interoperability gateways. InteropONE addresses this interoperability gap by enabling emergency management personnel to quickly bring together any person with a smartphone regardless of which carrier they subscribed to or whether the smartphone user subscribes to a PTTOC service. This capability is vitally important for effectively managing unplanned incidents that may involve groups of people that don’t normally collaborate. The Company expects to launch the service in the first quarter of 2023.

BKRplay is BK’s public safety smartphone application which provides access to the InteropONE service, as well as a host of other capabilities which make the first responder safer and more efficient. Built around an intelligent interface between a smartphone and our BK radio, BKRplay services deliver an enhanced customer experience which increases the sales reach of our radios. BKRplay is available to download free of charge from the Google Play or Apple App stores.

Description of Markets

Government and Public Safety Market

The government and public safety market includes military, fire, rescue, law enforcement, homeland security and emergency medical responder personnel, both domestic and international.  Government and public safety users currently use products that employ either P25 digital or analog technology.  However, public safety users in federal, state and local government agencies and certain other countries are migrating to digital P25 products.  The evolution of the standard and compliant digital products is explained in the preceding “Industry Overview” section.

In most instances, our KNG and BKR-branded products serve this market and are sold either directly to end-users or through two-way communications dealers.  

The BKRplay smartphone application and InteropONE POC service have been designed to service this market and are expected to be sold directly to end-users or through SaaS resellers.

Sales to government and public safety users represented substantially all of our sales for 2022 and 2021. 

Engineering, Research and Development

Our engineering and product development activities are conducted by a team of 31 employees.  Their primary development focus has been the design of a new line of next-generation P25 digital products, the BKR Series, which are in the process of supplanting our KNG products. The first product in this line, the VHF BKR5000 portable radio was introduced in August 2020.   The second product, the all-band BKR9000 portable radio is scheduled to be released in 2023.   Our KNG and BKR products also provide P25 compliant encrypted operation for secured communication, GPS location and network authentication capabilities.

 A segment of our engineering team is responsible for product specifications based on customer requirements and participates in quality assurance activities. They also have primary responsibility for applied and production engineering.

 For 2022 and 2021, our engineering and development expenses were approximately $9.6 million and $8.1 million, respectively. The increased expenditures in 2022 were primarily attributed to engineering staff expenses, which are focused on new BKR product development initiatives.

Intellectual Property

We presently have two U.S. patents in force, and we have four pending U.S. patent applications. We have registered U.S. trademarks related to the names “BK Technologies,” “BK Radio” and “Radios for Heroes” and have applied for registration of “BKR”, “BKRplay”, and “InteropONE”.   We rely on trade secret laws and employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights.
Manufacturing and Raw Materials

Our Made in America manufacturing strategy is to utilize the highest quality and most cost-effective resources available for every aspect of our manufacturing. Consistent with that strategy, we have successfully utilized a hybrid of Florida-based internal manufacturing capability in concert with outside contract arrangements for different manufacturing processes. In recent years, the breadth of our internal manufacturing capabilities has been expanded. Our outside manufacturing contract arrangements have been managed and updated to meet our present requirements, including increasing relationships with American concerns. This hybrid approach has been instrumental in ramping up our production capacity while controlling our product costs and managing our product quality.

 Contract manufacturers produce various subassemblies and products on our behalf. Generally, the contract manufacturers procure raw materials from BK-approved sources and complete manufacturing activities in accordance with our specifications. Manufacturing agreements and purchase orders govern the business relationship with the contract manufacturers. These agreements and purchase orders have various terms and conditions and may be renewed or modified upon agreement by both parties. Their scope may also be expanded to include new products in the future.

 We plan to expand our internal manufacturing capabilities and U.S.-based relationships, combined with other American manufacturers and suppliers where it furthers our business objectives. This strategy allows us to effectively manage quality, product costs and lead-times while focusing other resources on our core technological competencies of product design and development. We believe that, in certain circumstances, the use of experienced, high-quality, high-volume manufacturers can provide greater manufacturing specialization and expertise, higher levels of flexibility and responsiveness, and faster delivery of product, all of which contribute toward product cost control. To ensure that products manufactured by others meet our quality standards, our production and engineering teams work closely with our contract manufacturers in all key aspects of the production process. We establish product specifications, select the components and, in some cases, the suppliers. We retain all document control. We also work with our contract manufacturers to improve process control and product design and conduct periodic on-site inspections.

 We rely upon a limited number of both American and foreign suppliers for several key products and components. Approximately 61% of our material, subassembly and product procurements in 2022 were sourced from nine suppliers. We place purchase orders from time to time with these suppliers and have no guaranteed supply arrangements. In addition, certain components are obtained from single sources. During the first half of 2022, our operations were materially impaired due to delays from single-source suppliers. We manage the risk of such delays by securing secondary sources, where possible, and redesigning products in response to component shortages or obsolescence. We strive to maintain strong relationships with all of our suppliers. We anticipate that the current relationships, or others that are comparable, will be available to us in the future.

Seasonal Impact

 We may experience fluctuations in our quarterly results, in part, due to governmental customer spending patterns that are influenced by government fiscal year budgets and appropriations. We may also experience fluctuations in our quarterly results, derived, in part, from sales to federal and state agencies that participate in wildland fire-suppression efforts, which may be greater during the summer season when forest fire activity is heightened. In some years, these factors may cause an increase in sales for the second and third quarters, compared with the first and fourth quarters of the same fiscal year. Such increases in sales may cause quarterly variances in our cash flow from operations and overall financial results.
Significant Customers

 Sales to the U.S. Government represented approximately 38% and 36% of our total sales for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These sales were primarily to various government agencies, including those within the DHS, the U.S. Department of Defense (“DOD”), the USFS and the U.S. Department of Interior (“DoI”).
Backlog

 Our backlog of unshipped customer orders was approximately $27.0 million and $13.1 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  Changes in the backlog are attributed primarily to the timing of orders and their fulfillment, which can be impacted by factors related to our supply chain.
Competition

We compete with other domestic and foreign companies primarily in the North American market, but also internationally. One dominant competitor, Motorola Solutions, Inc., is estimated to have well in excess of half the market for LMR products. We compete by capitalizing on our advantages and strengths, which include price, product quality and customer responsiveness.
Governmental Regulation 

We are subject to various international and U.S. federal, state and local laws affecting our business. Any finding that we have been or are in noncompliance with such laws could result in, among other things, governmental penalties. Further, changes in existing laws or new laws may adversely affect our business and could also have the effect of limiting capital expenditures by our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In connection with our U.S. Government contracts, we are subject to the U.S. Federal Government procurement regulations that may provide the buyer with the right to audit and review our performance, as well as our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, our business is subject to government regulation based on the products we sell that may be subject to government requirements, such as obtaining an export license or end-user certificate from the buyer, in certain circumstances. If a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, or if we are alleged to have violated any laws or regulations governing the products we sell under our government contracts, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with U.S. Federal Government agencies.

Our radio products are regulated by the FCC in the U.S. and similar agencies in other countries where we offer our products. Consequently, we and our customers could be positively or negatively affected by the rules and regulations adopted from time to time by the FCC or regulatory agencies in other countries. For example, our wireless communications products, including two-way LMRs, are subject to FCC regulations related to radio frequency spectrum. As a result of limited spectrum availability, the FCC has mandated that new LMR equipment utilize technology that is more spectrum-efficient, which effectively meant that the industry had to migrate to digital technology. These types of mandates may provide us with new business opportunities or may require us to modify all or some of our products so that they can continue to be manufactured and marketed, which may lead to an increase in our capital expenditures and research and development expenses.

As a public company, we are also subject to regulations of the SEC and the stock exchange on which we are listed (NYSE American).

Some of our operations use substances regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws governing the environment and worker health and safety, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites, as well as relating to the protection of the environment. Certain of our products are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws governing chemical substances in electronic products. During 2022, compliance with these U.S. federal, state and local and international laws did not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

Human Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2022, we had 148 employees, most of whom are located at our West Melbourne, Florida facility; 84 of these employees are engaged in direct manufacturing or manufacturing support, 31 in engineering, 21 in sales and marketing, and 12 in headquarters, accounting and human resources activities. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements, nor has there ever been a labor-related work stoppage. We strive to develop and maintain good relations with our employees and believe our relations with our employees are good.

The Company complies with all applicable state, local and international laws governing nondiscrimination in employment in every location in which the Company operates. All applicants and employees are treated with the same high level of respect regardless of their gender, ethnicity, religion, national origin, age, marital status, political affiliation, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability or protected veteran status.

Our mission is to remain deeply rooted in the critical communications industry for all military, first responders, and public safety heroes. Our four guiding principles: growth, tenacious commitment to quality, continuous improvement, and a keen focus on being customer-centric, continuously drive our efforts to be the best partner for our customers, investment for our shareholders, neighbor in our community and to provide an empowering work environment for our employees.

The Company is committed to the health, safety and wellness of its employees. We have modified our business practices and implemented certain policies at our offices in accordance with best practices to accommodate, and at times mandate, social distancing and remote work practices, including restricting employee travel, modifying employee work locations, implementing social distancing and enhanced sanitary measures in our facilities, and cancelling attendance at events and conferences. In addition, we have invested in employee safety equipment, additional cleaning supplies and measures, re-designed production lines and workplaces as necessary and adapted new processes for interactions with our suppliers and customers to safely manage our operations.
