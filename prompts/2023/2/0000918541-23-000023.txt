Our medical business includes the production of a variety of tools and instruments for the orthopaedics and medical/surgical end markets.
Competitive Strengths
High-precision manufacturing capabilities
We believe our ability to produce high-precision parts at high production volumes is among the best in the market. Our technology platform consists of high precision machining, progressive stamping, injection molding, laser welding, material science, assembly, and design optimization. In-house tool design and process know-how create trade secrets that enable consistent production tolerances of less than one micron while producing millions of parts per day. Parts are manufactured to application-specific customer design and co-design standards that are developed for a specific use. The high-precision capabilities are part of our zero-defect design process, which seeks to eliminate variability and manufacturing defects throughout the entire product lifecycle. We believe our production capabilities provide a competitive advantage as few other manufacturers are capable of meeting tolerance demands at any volume level requested by our customers. As the need for tight-tolerance precision parts, subassemblies, and devices continues to increase, we believe that our production capabilities will place us at the forefront of the industry. We have differentiated ourselves among our competitors by providing customers engineered solutions and a broad reach and breadth of manufacturing capabilities. We believe it is for these reasons, and because of our proven ability to produce high-quality, precision parts and components on a cost-effective basis, that customers choose us to meet their manufacturing needs.
Differentiated, system-critical products
The tight-tolerance and high-quality nature of our precision products is specifically suited for use in the most demanding applications that require superior reliability. Our products are critical components to the operation and reliability of larger mechanical systems. Precision parts are difficult to manufacture and the high cost of failure motivates our customers to focus on quality. Our products are developed for specific uses within critical systems and are typically designed in conjunction with the system designer. Our parts are often qualified for, or specified in, customer designs, reducing the ability for customers to change suppliers.

Our ability to make products with tight-tolerance and extreme precision requirements enables our customers to satisfy the critical functionality and performance requirements of their products. We are included in customer designs and deployed in critical systems that involve high cost of failure applications and significant regulatory certification processes, including those for the Underwriters Laboratories (“UL”).
Complete product lifecycle focus
Our engineering expertise and deep knowledge of precision manufacturing processes adds proprietary value throughout the complete lifecycle of our products. Our in-house engineering team works closely with our customers to provide parts that meet specific design specifications for a given application. The relationship with the customer begins early in the conceptual design process when we provide feedback on potential cost, manufacturability, and estimated reliability of the parts. Part designs are then prototyped, tested, and qualified in coordination with the customer design process before going to full-scale production. The close working relationship with our customers early in the product lifecycle helps to secure business, increase industry knowledge, and develop significant trade secrets. Performance verification, product troubleshooting, and post-production engineering services further deepen relationships with our customers as well as provide additional industry knowledge that is applicable to future design programs and provide continuous manufacturing process improvement.
Prototype products are developed for testing, and process validation procedures are instituted. In certain instances, we will file for regulatory production approval and include the customer’s proprietary processes, further reducing supplier changes. We will assist the customer with continuous supply chain management and comprehensive customer support for the lifetime of the product and continuously seek to identify new operational efficiencies to reduce the product’s cost and improve its quality. Once our solution is designed into a platform, it is often embedded through the multi-year manufacturing lifecycle and has a competitive advantage in supporting subsequent platforms. As an added benefit, customers generally fund development, prototypes, and manufacturing tooling expenses. This discourages supplier changes and drives recurring revenue for us.
Long-term blue-chip customer base
We maintain relationships with hundreds of customers around the world. Our customers are typically sophisticated, engineering-driven, mechanical systems manufacturers with long histories of product development and reputations for quality. We have no significant retail exposure, which limits volatility and provides enhanced sales visibility. Relationships with our top ten customers, in terms of revenue, average more than ten years. We have significant exposure to emerging markets in Asia, South America, and Europe through these global customers as well as key local manufacturers. The diverse nature, size, and reach of our customer base provides resistance to localized market and geographic fluctuations and helps stabilize overall product demand.
Strategic global footprint
Our 31 facilities, on four continents, are strategically located to serve our customer base and provide local service and expertise. Our global footprint provides flexibility to locally supply identical products for global customers, reducing shipping time and expense, allowing us to match costs to revenue and to capitalize on industry localization trends. In total, we operate more than 2.1 million square feet of manufacturing space. North America constitutes the largest portion of our manufacturing operations with facilities in the U.S. and Mexico. The North American facilities are strategically located to serve major customers in the United States and Mexico. Our foreign facilities are located in regional manufacturing hubs in France, Poland, China, and Brazil, and primarily serve global customers in those local markets. We believe that the Asian and South American facilities have significant growth potential as local customer bases expand and the markets for high-precision products grow in those regions.
Synergies
We continue to realize synergy effects between Mobile Solutions and Power Solutions by pairing our experienced engineering resources and wide-ranging portfolio of process technologies from each business to serve our customers’ ever evolving needs. Recent solutions developed in the electrical, electric vehicle, and general industrial markets leveraged the deep experience and expertise from each business to respond to tight, stringent requirements - all of which in a custom and innovative manner to meet each customer’s unique demand requirements. In addition, we continue to experience customer demand that utilizes multiple facilities from both businesses on a global basis due to our track record of quality and strong performance.
Customers
Our products are supplied primarily to manufacturers for use in a broad range of industrial applications, including automotive; electrical; agricultural; construction; residential devices and equipment; aerospace and defense; medical; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; and fluid power and diesel engines. Sales to each of our top ten customers are made to multiple customer locations and divisions throughout the world. In 2022, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 48% of our net sales. In 2022, 70% of our products were sold to customers in North America, 13% to customers in Asia, 10% to customers in South America, and 7% to customers in Europe.

We sell our products to most of our largest customers under either sales contracts or agreed upon commercial terms. In general, we pass through material cost fluctuations when incurred to our customers in the form of changes in selling prices. We ordinarily ship our products directly to customers within 60 days, and in many cases, during the same calendar month of the date on which a sales order is placed. 
Sales and Marketing
A primary emphasis of our marketing strategy is to expand key customer relationships by offering high quality, high-precision, application-specific customer solutions with the value of a single supply chain partner for a wide variety of products and components. Due to the technical nature of many of our products, our engineers and manufacturing management personnel also provide technical sales support functions, while internal sales employees handle customer orders and other general sales support activities. Our marketing strategy is to offer custom manufactured, high quality, precision products to markets with high value-added characteristics at competitive price levels. This strategy focuses on relationships with key customers that require the production of technically difficult parts and assemblies, enabling us to take advantage of our strengths in custom product development, equipment and tool design, component assembly, and machining processes.
Human Capital Management 
Core Principles
Our success depends in part on our ability to successfully manage our human capital resources, including attracting, identifying, and retaining key talent. Factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, competition from other employers, and availability of qualified individuals in the communities in which we operate.
Headcount
As of December 31, 2022, we employed a total of 3,363 full and part-time employees and 298 temporary workers, which includes 1,335 employees in the U.S. and 2,326 employees in other countries employed by our international subsidiaries. Of our total employment, approximately 12% are management/staff employees and 88% are production employees. Our employees in the France, Brazil, and Mexico City plants are subject to labor council relationships that vary due to the diverse countries in which we operate. We believe we have a good working relationship with our employees and the unions that represent them.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DE&I”)
Diversity, equity, and inclusion are at the core of our values and strategic business priorities. Throughout our business, we champion equality, supporting parity for women and under-represented groups as we work to create ethical, safe, and supportive workplaces where our employees thrive. We believe a diverse and inclusive workplace results in business growth and encourages increased innovation, retention of talent, and a more engaged workforce. Respect for human rights is fundamental to our business and our commitment to ethical business conduct, as is embodied by our Human Rights Policy, which sets forth our expectations related to workplace discrimination; diversity, equity and inclusion; workplace conditions; and freedom of association.
Compensation, Benefits, and Employee Health and Safety
Our compensation programs are based on a strong alignment between pay and performance, and are designed to reward both financial and operational successes and support actions that drive stockholder value creation at all organizational levels. We use a combination of programs (which vary by geography and level) to attract and retain our employees, including annual performance bonuses, quarterly gainsharing bonuses, and equity awards.
We also provide our employees and their families access to a range of benefits, including health insurance benefits, employer-paid life and disability insurance, health savings and flexible spending accounts, 401(k) match, vacation and paid time off, wellness offerings, education assistance, and an employee assistance program.
The health and safety of our employees and anyone who conducts business on our behalf is very important to us. Our commitment to safety starts at the top levels of our organization. We believe a safe and secure workplace is fundamental to our success. We are also committed to engaging our employees to continually improve health and safety by acting upon opportunities to reduce risk and improve our safety and health performance. In addition we offer training programs on a regular basis. We maintain comprehensive safety programs focused on identifying hazards and eliminating risks that can lead to work-place injuries.
In addition to the strong safety focus that we maintain within our operations, our emphasis during the COVID-19 pandemic has been on protecting the health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate. Our team monitors country, state, and local guidance, and uses these to implement best practice guidelines for employees and visitors. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we increased communications, including the addition of virtual “town hall” style meetings at the 

group and organizational level. This has helped employees across our global footprint stay connected, whether working from home or at one of our manufacturing sites.
Talent Development
We invest resources in professional development to improve employee motivation, performance and engagement. Our annual talent management program helps identify needs at multiple levels, enabling us to provide employees with the resources they need to help achieve their career goals, build skills and lead their organizations. Further, annual goal-setting and development opportunities for employees and leaders helps our people align their professional experience with the Company’s business objectives and encourages them to take ownership of their development and career paths.
We use regular talent management and performance evaluation processes to inform the Company’s internal development processes and to calibrate assessment of individual performance organizationally. These activities form the basis for succession planning activities, up to and including the senior leadership level. 
We also have apprenticeships, internships, and cooperative education programs in place at certain locations, which we intend to expand more broadly across the company. These programs allow us to provide a combination of education and employment options that deliver depth and context and help them build a long-term career path.
Competition
Mobile Solutions
In the market in which Mobile Solutions operates, internal production of components by our customers can impact our business as the customers weigh the risk of outsourcing strategically critical components or producing in-house. Our primary competitors are: Anton Häring KG; A. Berger Holding GmbH & Co. KG; Brovedani Group, Burgmaier Technologies GmbH & Co. KG; CIE Automotive, S.A.; IMS Companies; and MacLean-Fogg Component Solutions. We believe that we generally win new business on the basis of our technical competence, proven track record of successful product development and global platform, as well as on quality, price, and service.
Power Solutions
Power Solutions operates in intensely competitive but very fragmented supply chains.  We must compete with numerous companies in each industry market segment. Our primary competitors are: Checon Corporation; Deringer-Ney, Inc.; Electrical Contacts, Ltd.; Interplex Industries, Inc.; J&J Machining, LLC; Norstan, Inc.; Owens Industries, Inc.; and Precinmac Precision Machining. We believe that competition within the electrical end market is based principally on quality, price, design capabilities, and speed of responsiveness and delivery.  We believe that our competitive strengths are product development, tool design, fabrication, tight tolerance processes, and customer solutions.  With these strengths, we have built our reputation in the marketplace as a quality producer of technically difficult products.
Raw Materials
Mobile Solutions
Mobile Solutions produces products from a wide variety of metals in various forms from various sources located in the North America, Europe, South America, and Asia.  Basic types include hot rolled steel, cold rolled steel (both carbon and alloy), stainless, extruded aluminum, die cast aluminum, gray and ductile iron castings, hot and cold forgings, and mechanical tubing. Some material is purchased directly under contracts, some is consigned by the customer, and some is purchased directly from the steel mills.
Power Solutions
Power Solutions uses a wide variety of metals in various forms, including precious metals like gold, silver, palladium, and platinum, as well as plastics. Through our diverse network of suppliers, we minimize supplier concentration risk and provide a stable supply of raw materials at competitive pricing.  This group also procures resins and metal stampings from several domestic and foreign suppliers. Power Solutions bases purchase decisions on quality, service and price.  Generally, we do not enter into written supply contracts with our suppliers or commit to maintain minimum monthly purchases of materials.  However, we carefully manage raw material price volatility, particularly with respect to precious metals, through the use of consignment agreements. In effect, we contract the precious metals for our own stock and buy the raw materials on the same day customer shipments are priced, thereby eliminating risk of price changes from procurement to product shipment.
Supply and Cost Pressures
In each of our segments, we have historically been affected by upward price pressure on steel principally due to general increases in global demand. In general, we pass through material cost fluctuations to our customers in the form of changes in selling price. Most of the raw materials we use are purchased from various suppliers and are typically available from numerous sources, some of which are located in China and Europe. The COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing supply chain disruptions, resulting in supply shortages and higher shipping charges, have impacted our suppliers and could continue to impact our ability 

to maintain supplies of products and the costs associated with obtaining raw materials and key components. We continue to monitor the effects of these impacts on our supply chain in order to maintain regular and timely supply of raw materials to our business segments. 
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
We have several U.S. patents, patent applications and trademarks for various trade names. However, we cannot be certain that we would be able to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights against third parties, and if we cannot do so, we may face increased competition and diminished net sales.
Furthermore, third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on their patents or other intellectual property, and we may have to pay substantial damages and/or redesign our products if we are ultimately found to infringe. Even if such intellectual property claims against us are without merit, investigating and defending these types of lawsuits takes significant time, may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns.
Additionally, we rely on certain data and processes, including trade secrets and know-how, and the success of our business depends, to some extent, on such information remaining confidential. Each officer is subject to a non-competition and confidentiality agreement that seeks to protect this information. Additionally, all employees are subject to company code of ethics policies that prohibit the disclosure of information critical to the operations of our business.
Seasonal Nature of Business
General economic conditions impact our business and financial results, and certain businesses experience seasonal and other trends related to the industries and end markets that they serve. For example, European sales are often weaker in the summer months as customers slow production, automotive sales tend to slow in July and December, and sales to original equipment manufacturers are often stronger immediately preceding and following the launch of new products. However, as a whole, we are not materially impacted by seasonality.
Government Regulations and Environmental Matters
Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign regulatory requirements, including those intended to protect public health and the environment. In the U.S. certain of our products and operations are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency. Similar regulations have been adopted by authorities in foreign countries where we sell our products, and by state and local authorities in the U.S. In order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state, local, and foreign governmental authorities.
We are also required to comply with increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations enacted to protect business and personal data in the U.S. and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, use, transmission, and protection of personal information and other customer, supplier or employee data. Such privacy and data protection laws and regulations, and the interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations, are continuously developing and evolving and there is significant uncertainty with respect to how compliance with these laws and regulations may evolve and the costs and complexity of future compliance.
Based on information compiled to date, management believes that our current operations are in substantial compliance with applicable governmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.  As of the date hereof, compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, and competitive position. For additional information, see “Item 1A - Risk Factors.”
The potential impact of climate change on our operations is unclear. Climate change could result in an increase in severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, blizzards and ice storms, which often results in delays or other negative consequences for our manufacturing operations, which could negatively impact our financial results. We have not identified any, and we do not believe there to be in the near term, material impacts on our business, financial condition or results of operations as a result of compliance with legislation or regulatory rules regarding climate change or from the known physical effects of climate change. Increased regulation and other climate change concerns, however, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions and could negatively affect our business, operations and financial results.
On May 5, 2022, we released our 2021 Sustainability Report which established our global sustainability strategy. We conducted a comprehensive environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) materiality assessment to identify our most significant economic, environmental and social impacts. The material ESG topics identified during this process enable our organization to prioritize our investments and actions and provide meaningful disclosures throughout this report. We intend to regularly review and update our ESG priorities on an ongoing basis to ensure they continue to reflect our evolving business operations. The information provided in our 2021 Sustainability Report as well as on our website, is not part of this Annual Report, and is therefore not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report or other filings with the SEC.
