Item 1. Business
Company Overview and Formation
 
We believe that natural gas in the form of LNG will play an important role in the energy transition, but its contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced to an absolute minimum. Through our subsidiary Rio Grande, we are developing the Terminal, and we seek to minimize its associated emissions footprint by developing a CCS project at the Terminal (the “Terminal CCS project”), combined with using responsibly sourced natural gas and our pledge to use net-zero electricity.
 
We also believe reducing CO2 emissions from industrial facilities around the world is critical to realizing the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming compared to pre-industrial levels. We believe carbon capture and storage equipment and technology must be extensively implemented to achieve this goal, and through our subsidiary NEXT Carbon Solutions, we seek to deploy the proprietary carbon capture and storage processes that we have developed at industrial source facilities to reduce CO2 emission levels.
 
Our management is comprised of a team of industry leaders with extensive experience in the development of major projects. We have focused our development activities on the Terminal and undertaking various initiatives to evaluate, design, and engineer the Terminal that we expect will result in demand for LNG supply, which would enable us to seek construction financing to develop the Terminal and have expanded into developing CCS projects through NEXT Carbon Solutions.
 
We were incorporated in Delaware on May 21, 2014, and were formed for the purpose of acquiring, through a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization, or other similar business combination, one or more businesses or entities. On July 24, 2017, one of our subsidiaries merged with and into NextDecade LLC, an LNG development company founded in 2010 to develop LNG export projects and associated pipelines.  Prior to the merger with NextDecade LLC, we had no operations and our assets consisted of cash proceeds received in connection with our initial public offering.
 
Our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “NEXT.”
 
Rio Grande
 
Rio Grande is developing the Terminal on a 984-acre site in southern Texas.  The Terminal, in conjunction with the Terminal CCS Project is designed to offer competitively priced LNG in the global market while emitting what we believe to be a lower level of CO2 per million tonnes per annum (“mtpa”) of LNG produced than other LNG terminals currently in operation or under construction.
 
All necessary permits and approvals to build the Terminal and export LNG have been obtained, including the Terminal design and the ability to mobilize to site and perform full site preparation and test pilings, pending final FERC notice to proceed. The site has deep-water port access and is supported by area-wide marine infrastructure. The Terminal will deploy proven Air Products liquefaction technology and we intend to deploy carbon capture and storage technology to capture greater than 90 percent of facility CO2 emissions. Rio Grande has lump-sum separated turnkey contracts with Bechtel Oil, Gas and Chemicals, Inc. (“Bechtel”), the engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”) contractor.  The Rio Bravo Pipeline (defined below) will connect the Terminal to the Agua Dulce supply area. The Agua Dulce supply area is supplied by significant natural gas resources in Texas, including the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale.
 
Development Actions 
 
On November 22, 2019, the Terminal received an order from the FERC (“the Order”) authorizing the siting, construction, and operation of six liquefaction trains, four LNG storage tanks (each with a capacity of 180,000 cubic meters (“m3”)), two marine jetties for ocean-going LNG vessels, one turning basin, and six truck loading bays for LNG and natural gas liquids and all associated facilities for the production of up to 27 mtpa of LNG for export.
 
The original front-end engineering and design for the Terminal was based on six LNG trains capable of producing 27 mtpa of LNG for export. The technologies that were selected and filed with the FERC in 2015 and 2016 evolved over the five-year permitting period; the individual LNG trains are now more efficient and will produce a greater volume of LNG with lower total CO2 emissions. Multiple optimizations have been identified that will enable delivery of the Terminal capable of producing 27 mtpa with just five LNG trains instead of six.
 
We expect the optimization to a five-train project to result in several environmental and community benefits when compared with our original six-train project, including (i) approximately 21 percent lower CO2 emissions (independent of the GHG emissions reductions enabled by the deployment of the Terminal CCS project), (ii) a shortened construction timeline for the full 27 mtpa project, (iii) reduced facility footprint, and (iv) reduction in roadway traffic.
 
Engineering, Procurement, and Construction
 
Rio Grande is party to two lump-sum separated turnkey (“LSTK”) EPC agreements with Bechtel for the construction of (i) two LNG trains with expected aggregate production capacity up to approximately 11.74 mtpa, two 180,000m3 full containment LNG tanks, one marine loading berth, related utilities and facilities, and all related appurtenances thereto, together with certain additional work options (the “Trains 1 and 2 EPC Agreement”) and (ii) an LNG train with expected production capacity of up to approximately 5.87 mtpa, related utilities and facilities, and all related appurtenances  thereto (the “Train 3 EPC Agreement” and together with the Trains 1 and 2 EPC Agreement, the “EPC Agreements”).  As of December 31, 2022, we have issued eight limited notices to proceed to Bechtel under the Trains 1 and 2 EPC Agreement.
Commercial
 
We are continuing commercial discussions with a variety of parties ranging from large utilities and state-sponsored enterprises to portfolio and multinational commodity interests. Leveraging the global relationships and extensive experience of our management team, we expect to sign long-term binding offtake commitments for substantially all of the project liquefaction train’s capacity prior to a positive FID with respect to such liquefaction trains.
 
We believe the Terminal’s location will provide customers with access to low-cost natural gas from the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale. We are focused on selling LNG to customers primarily through a “free on board” (“FOB”) model whereby a marketing affiliate would acquire feed gas, the Terminal would produce the LNG, and the title transfer would occur at the interface between the Terminal and the customer’s ship.
 
We offer multiple LNG pricing options and flexible contract tenors (from 10 – 20 years), meeting the evolving needs of our customers and maximizing our total addressable market.

As of March 10, 2023, our portfolio of LNG sales and purchase agreements was as follows:
 


Customer | Volume (mtpa) | Tenor (years) | Delivery Model
-------------------------------------------------------+---------------+-----------------------------+---------------
Shell NA LNG LLC (“Shell”) | 2.0 | 20 | FOB 
ENN LNG Singapore Pte Ltd. (“ENN”) | 2.0 | 20 | FOB 
ENGIE S.A. (“ENGIE”) | 1.75 | 15 | FOB 
China Gas Hongda Energy Trading Co., LTD (“China Gas”) | 1.0 | 20 | FOB 
Guangdong Energy Group (“Guangdong Energy”) | 1.0 | 20 | Ex Ship 
Exxon Mobil LNG Asia Pacific (“EMLAP”) | 1.0 | 20 | FOB 
Galp Trading S.A. (“Galp”) | 1.0 | 20 | FOB 
Itochu Corporation (“Itochu”) | 1.0 | 15 | FOB 
Total | 10.75 | 18.7 years weighted average | 

 
In the first quarter of 2020, the SPA with Shell became effective upon the conditions precedent in such SPA being satisfied or waived.  The SPA obligates Rio Grande to deliver the contracted volumes of LNG to Shell at the FOB delivery point, subject to the first liquefaction train at the Terminal becoming commercially operable.  
 
Each of our other SPAs becomes effective upon the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, which include a positive final investment decision on the initial phase of the Terminal.
 
Governmental Permits, Approvals and Authorizations
 
We are required to obtain governmental approvals and authorizations to implement our proposed business strategy, which includes the design, construction and operation of the Terminal and the export of LNG from the U.S. to foreign countries. The design, siting, construction and operation of LNG export terminals is a regulated activity and is subject to Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (the "NGA"). Federal law has bifurcated regulatory jurisdiction of LNG export activities. The FERC has jurisdiction to authorize the siting, construction and operation of LNG export facilities. The DOE has jurisdiction over the import and export of the natural gas commodity, including natural gas in the form of LNG. The FERC also has jurisdiction over the siting, construction and operation of interstate natural gas pipelines under Section 7 of the NGA and regulates interstate pipelines’ rates and terms and conditions of service under Sections 4 and 5 of the NGA. In 2002, the FERC established a policy of not regulating the terms and conditions of service for LNG import or export facilities or requiring that LNG import or export facilities operate as “open access” facilities for all customers. The Energy Policy Act of 2005, which amended the NGA, codified this policy until January 1, 2015, and the FERC has not indicated that it intends to depart from its policy of not regulating the terms or conditions of service or requiring that LNG terminals operate on an open access basis.
 
Although the FERC acts as the lead agency with jurisdiction over LNG import and export facilities, other federal and state agencies act as cooperating agencies, coordinating with the FERC to evaluate applications for LNG export facilities. These agencies include the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (the “PHMSA”), the U.S. Coast Guard (the “Coast Guard”), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the International Boundary and Water Commission and other federal agencies with jurisdiction over potential environmental impacts of LNG terminal construction and operation. Certain federal laws, such as the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and the Coastal Zone Management Act, delegate authority over certain actions to state agencies, like the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the Railroad Commission of Texas. In reviewing an application for an LNG import or export terminal or an interstate natural gas pipeline, the FERC also works with these state agencies that have jurisdiction over certain aspects of LNG terminal or interstate natural gas pipeline construction or operation.
 
In particular, the PHMSA has established safety standards for interstate natural gas pipelines and LNG facilities. Similarly, the Coast Guard has established safety regulations for marine operations at LNG facilities and the operation of LNG carriers. The FERC, the PHMSA and the Coast Guard entered into a Memorandum of Understanding in 2004 that establishes the FERC’s primary role in evaluating LNG terminal applications and defines the process for coordinating the review of an LNG import or export terminal application with the PHMSA and the Coast Guard. In 2018, the FERC and the PHMSA entered into a separate Memorandum of Understanding that establishes the process and timeline by which the PHMSA should determine whether an LNG terminal project will meet the PHMSA’s LNG safety siting standards.
 
We have obtained all major permits required to build the Terminal and export LNG, pending final FERC notice to proceed.
 
As indicated above, on November 22, 2019, we received the Order from FERC authorizing the siting, construction and operation of the Terminal.  On August 13, 2020, the FERC approved the change of the design for the Terminal from six trains to five trains. On September 22, 2021, Rio Grande received the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Permit issued under CWA Section 404/RHA – Section 10.
 
On September 7, 2016, Rio Grande obtained an authorization for export of LNG to countries with which the U.S. has a Free Trade Agreement (“FTA”) on its own behalf and as an agent for others for a term of 30 years. On February 10, 2020, the DOE issued its “Opinion and Order Granting Long-Term Authorization to Export Liquefied Natural Gas to Non-Free Trade Agreement Nations to Rio Grande" in DOE/FE Order No. 4492.  In addition, on October 21, 2020, the DOE issued its Order Extending Export Term for Authorization to Non-Free Trade Agreement Nations through December 31, 2050.
 
Following receipt of the Order, two requests for re-hearing were filed. One of those requests for rehearing also requested that the FERC stay the Order. On January 23, 2020, the FERC issued its Order on Rehearing and Stay in which the FERC rejected all challenges presented in the requests for rehearing and the request for stay of the Order.  The parties who filed the requests for re-hearing petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (“D.C. Circuit”) to review the Order and the order denying rehearing. On August 3, 2021, the D.C. Circuit denied all petitions, except for two technical issues dealing with environmental justice and GHG emissions, which were remanded to the FERC for further consideration.  The D.C. Circuit did so without vacatur, and accordingly, the Terminal's authorization from the FERC remains legally valid and enforceable.  A second appeal was also filed with the same court by the same parties, seeking a review of the FERC letter order amending the Order to account for the design change from six to five trains but the petitioners moved to voluntarily dismiss this appeal on August 23, 2021.

Parties also filed a similar appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in respect to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit issued pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. On January 5, 2023, the court fully denied the appeal rejecting each of the challengers’ arguments.
 
On November 17, 2021, Rio Grande filed a Limited Amendment with the FERC, seeking authorization to incorporate carbon capture and storage systems, which would enable Rio Grande to voluntarily capture and sequester at least 90% of the CO2 generated at the Terminal.  Once captured, the CO2 will be transported via pipeline to an underground geologic formation permitted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and relevant Texas agencies via the existing underground injection control (“UIC”) Class VI permitting regime for geologic sequestration of CO2.
 
On October 14, 2022, Rio Grande received from FERC a two-year extension of time, until November 22, 2028, to complete construction of the Terminal and place it into service.  Rio Grande’s initial order had required that Rio Grande complete construction of the Terminal within seven years of the date of the Order, by November 22, 2026.  Rio Grande sought an extension of this deadline, explaining to FERC that despite NextDecade’s efforts to develop the Terminal, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted NextDecade’s ability to secure sufficient offtake agreements to reach a positive investment decision and commence construction of the Terminal.  FERC found that this demonstrated good cause existed to extend the commencement of construction deadline, and accordingly approved Rio Grande’s request.
 
Gas Supply
 
The proposed Terminal site is located near Brownsville, Texas, benefiting from close access to gas supply from the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale. We expect to realize material benefits from providing our customers with access to these low-cost associated gas resources. 
 
The Permian Basin offers one of the deepest inventories of economic natural gas resource in the world. According to Enverus, there are approximately 700 trillion cubic feet ("Tcf") of remaining natural gas resource in the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale. Permian Basin economics are largely driven by the production of oil, such that producers must market their associated natural gas at any price in order to sustain oil production programs. Furthermore, major oil companies and independent shale producers have created extraordinary efficiencies and improvements, including extended lateral lengths and hydraulic fracturing technology, rig productivity, and reductions in operating and lifecycle costs, which will support economic development of these vast reserves. We believe the Permian Basin will produce very substantial quantities of low-cost natural gas for decades.
 
We began developing the Rio Bravo Pipeline (the “Pipeline”) to connect Rio Grande to these low-cost associated gas reserves.  On March 2, 2020, we completed the sale of Rio Bravo Pipeline Company, LLC (“Rio Bravo”) to Spectra Energy Transmission II, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Enbridge, Inc (“Enbridge”). Enbridge is continuing the development of the Pipeline.  In connection with the sale of Rio Bravo, our indirect, wholly owned subsidiary, Rio Grande LNG Gas Supply LLC (“Rio Grande Gas Supply”), entered into precedent agreements (the “Transportation Precedent Agreements”) with Rio Bravo and Valley Crossing Pipeline, LLC (“VCP”), pursuant to which Rio Grande Gas Supply will retain its rights to the natural gas firm transportation capacity on the Pipeline for a term of at least twenty years and Rio Bravo and VCP will provide pipeline transportation service to Rio Grande Gas Supply in order to supply natural gas to the Terminal.
 
Through the Transportation Precedent Agreements and the Pipeline’s projected interconnects with a combined receipt capacity of more than 10 billion cubic feet per day (“Bcf/d”), we believe that we will have supply flexibility needed to supply natural gas efficiently and reliably to the Terminal. The combination of increased production in the Permian and Eagle Ford, together with expanding takeaway capacity indicates that the Agua Dulce supply area, from which the Pipeline is proposed to be routed, is expected to become increasingly liquid and remain competitively priced to Henry Hub. We believe our proximity to two major gas reserves basins, increasing takeaway capacity in the area, a significant influx of production and infrastructure investment, as well as our existing contacts and discussions with some of the largest regional operators, represent key elements of a compelling feed gas strategy for partners and customers alike. We are continuing to advance substantive negotiations in these areas.
 
NEXT Carbon Solutions
 
Carbon capture and storage (“CCS”) is the process of (i) capturing CO2 at the source, (ii) compressing the CO2 for transportation and (iii) injecting the compressed CO2 into deep rock formations at a safe site, where it is then monitored and permanently stored.  According to The World Resources Institute, the world currently emits more than 50 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions annually. The Paris Agreement is a multilateral, binding agreement that brings nations together in a common cause to combat climate change and adapt to its effects. We believe that deploying CCS equipment and technology is key to achieving global de-carbonization, a goal of the Paris Agreement.
 
NEXT Carbon Solutions offers end-to-end CCS solutions for industrial facilities and power plants that produce CO2 that would otherwise be emitted. Leveraging our team’s years of engineering and project management experience, we have developed proprietary processes that lower the capital and operating costs of deploying CCS on industrial facilities. We expect to partner with customers to invest in the deployment of CCS to reduce and permanently store CO2 emissions.
 
Service Offerings and Potential Market
 
NEXT Carbon Solutions’ proprietary CCS processes use an absorption post-combustion CO2 removal system. Derived from extensive engineering efforts, our proprietary CCS processes are designed to generate the following benefits as compared to existing applications of carbon capture and storage processes:

• | Enable CO2 capture up to an expected 95% of emissions generated from a source facility;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Competitive cost (both capital and operating expenditures) of post-combustion CCS;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Use proven technology and equipment to capture CO2 emissions at scale;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Optimize energy requirements;
--+------------------------------


• | Substantially reduce or, in some cases, eliminate consumption of fresh-water compared to post-combustion carbon capture technologies utilizing water to cool the flue gas; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduce the land footprint.
--+---------------------------

Our proprietary CCS processes do not include new equipment or technology. We have developed novel applications of existing industrial-scale equipment to reduce the capital and operating expenditures associated with the CCS process applied at scale. These novel designs and processes represent the intellectual property of NEXT Carbon Solutions that includes patents and patents pending.  Consequently, NEXT Carbon Solutions is technology agnostic allowing its business to evolve with advancements in components of the CCS process while still maintaining its anticipated competitive advantages.
 
Our end-to-end CCS offering includes design, construction, operation, capture, transportation, and permanent geologic storage of captured CO2. 
 
Each customer-specific CCS design represents a bespoke application of our proprietary CCS processes. Due to the unique operational aspects of each customer, we undertake preliminary front-end engineering and design activities in determining optimal designs for CCS integration with each source facility.
 
NEXT Carbon Solutions' marketing efforts target existing CO2 source facilities having emissions greater than one million tonnes of CO2 per annum and that are in close proximity to saline aquifer storage capacity.  We understand that there are more than 600 facilities in the United States alone that produce more than one million tonnes of CO2 per annum, representing a very robust addressable market.  We believe the optimal transportation and storage solution for our customers is a point-to-point solution, whereby, CO2 captured from a source facility is permanently stored in a proximate and dedicated saline aquifer storage site. CO2 storage hubs also offer an alternative CO2 storage solution.  Our analysis indicates that source emitters of greater than one million tonnes per annum are sufficient in size to support a point-to-point sequestration model.
 
Potential Sources of Value
 
Integrated deployment of CCS processes at a source facility has the potential to generate value from a variety of sources including: government incentives, such as the Internal Revenue Code Section 45Q tax credit, buildout and marketing of a portfolio of low cost, independently verified carbon credits, environmental, social, and corporate governance (“ESG”) premiums, blue product marketing, and, in certain potential commercial arrangements, increased market share earned by the source facility following CCS deployment.
 
We offer prospective customers a variety of commercial structures, aimed at providing sufficient flexibility to meet customers’ ESG goals, commercial desires, risk profiles and investing strategies. We also believe that certain of our prospective customers may have significant commercial upside due to improved competitive position resulting from a full integration of the source facility with CCS processes, and we will seek to share in this value creation when applicable. Further, we believe that a blend of cash flow streams, risk and reward profiles and contractual terms expected from a portfolio of projects would generate positive returns to our shareholders. NEXT Carbon Solutions will negotiate commercial terms with prospective customers on a case-by-case basis based on the unique characteristics of the relevant source facility.
 
Competition 
 
We are subject to a high degree of competition in all aspects of our business. See “Item 1.A — Risk Factors —Competition in the energy industry is intense, and some of our competitors have greater financial, technological and other resources.”
 
The Terminal will compete with liquefaction facilities worldwide to supply low-cost liquefaction to the market. In addition, we will compete with a variety of companies in the global LNG market, such as independent, technology-driven companies, state-owned and other independent oil and natural gas companies and utilities. Many of these competitors have longer operating histories, more development experience, greater name recognition, greater access to the LNG market, more employees and substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we currently possess.
 
NEXT Carbon Solutions will compete with other providers of CCS services, traditional original end manufacturers, EPC firms and midstream transportation and storage companies in offering CCS solutions.  Our competitors in the CCS space may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we currently possess.
