Our Company



We are a preclinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing novel and proprietary drug delivery systems across various pain indications in order to enhance compliance and optimize each product candidate in our pipeline. Our drug-delivery systems and drug-releasing technologies being developed are focused on advancing non-opioid and non-addictive pain management treatments and treatments for central nervous system (“CNS”) disorders to enhance patients’ quality of life.



We have exclusive global rights to the following proprietary patented technologies: (i) Molecular Envelope Technology (“MET”) that uses an intranasal device to deliver enkephalin for the management of acute and chronic pain, including pain associated with cancer (Envelta™) and PTSD (PES200), (ii) Injectable “local anesthetic” Liposomal Gel Technology for postoperative pain management (Probudur™), and (iii) Topical Spray Film Delivery Technology for osteoarthritis pain (Epoladerm™). We intend to utilize these delivery technologies to selectively develop a portfolio of patented 505(b)(2) and new chemical entity (“NCE”) candidates for commercialization. We also have exclusive global rights to develop and commercialize an investigational formulation delivered via the nasal route to enhance pharmaceutical-grade cannabidiol (“CBD”) transport to the brain (“NobrXiolTM”, formerly VRP324) to potentially treat seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (“TSC”), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome in patients one year of age and older.



While we are currently focused on advancing non-opioid and non-addictive pain management treatments and treatments for CNS disorders, we also plan on using our proprietary delivery technologies to develop our anti-viral therapy (AnQlar™) as a viral barrier to potentially prevent or reduce the risk or the intensity of viral infections in humans, including, but not limited to, influenza and SARS-CoV-2 (“COVID 19”).We have exclusive global rights for AnQlar pursuant to a collaboration and license agreement.



Our Portfolio



Our portfolio currently consists of multiple preclinical stage product candidates: Epoladerm, Probudur, Envelta, PES200, AnQlar and NobrXiol. In the accompanying section we will describe each product candidate, its benefits, and our market strategy for each product candidate. The dates reflected in the below table are estimates only, and there can be no assurances that the events included in the table will be completed on the anticipated timeline presented, or at all.









We are also developing Envelta for a second indication, PES200, which utilizes the same delivery mechanism as Envelta. PES200 enables the delivery of a metabolically labile peptide drug (Enkephalin) into the brain for post-traumatic stress disorder. 











Long-acting Bupivacaine Liposomal-gel 3.0% (LBL100 or ProbudurTM)



Probudur is a drug product candidate based on a unique liposomal delivery system utilizing large multi-vesicular vesicles (“LMVVs”) encapsulating a high dose of the local anesthetic bupivacaine. These drug-loaded liposomes are composed of lecithin and cholesterol which are GRAS by the FDA. These LMVVs are embedded in hydrogel beads to form a Lipogel. The system delivers a local analgesic medicine from the Lipogel. Early non-clinical animal studies produced data which suggests that Probudur may be able to provide improved onset, duration and peak performance properties as compared to a similar product on the market. The animal studies were conducted by administering Probudur by local infiltration of the surgical site which resulted in keeping the active ingredient localized at the surgical site for a longer period of time. Four trials were conducted using three animal models. Data from these animal studies showed that after treatment with Probudur (50 mg/kg), statistically significant analgesic activity (measured as threshold pressure at animal’s withdrawal of the treated extremity) was observed in comparison to control (vehicle), for as long as 96 hours post-treatment (22.33±3.67g vs 5.00±0.58g; p<0.05), which is 24 hours longer than the leading product on the market.



If we are able to demonstrate a successful Phase III clinical trial, we believe Probudur may represent the first long acting local anesthetic with an opioid sparing label. The slow release of the drug from the liposomal depot reduces the peak plasma levels, reducing toxicity while also potentially providing longer-lasting post-operative pain control. We believe this property may permit administration of higher bupivacaine doses (3% versus 1.3% in leading market product); however, there can be no assurances, based on these animal studies, that Probudur will be safe and effective as these determinations are solely within the authority of the FDA. Further, there can be no assurance that Probudur will receive FDA approval.



Image 2 below illustrates the results of the early animal studies of Probudur:







Image 2











We plan to market Probudur to general surgeons, anesthesiologists, and orthopedic surgeons within the $35 billion post operative pain management market local anesthetic post-surgical market. If the product candidate is used appropriately, we believe this product candidate could potentially eliminate the need for opioids for post-operative pain relief. As a result of our IND review, the FDA has indicated that it is reasonable for us to pursue a 505(b)(2) accelerated NDA for Probudur. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing regulatory approval under the 505(b)(2) pathway or that we will be successful in mitigating risks associated with the clinical development of this product candidate.



Image 3, below, displays the planned delivery of Probudur at the wound site:

Charles River Laboratories was engaged to perform seven preclinical animal studies during the second half of 2021, including method, dosage, and toxicity as part of the required FDA enabling trials for an IND filing for Probudur. However, we elected to strategically delay these trials in order to enhance the formulation of Probudur to increase stability for manufacturing purposes and to possibly extend the lifetime of a relevant patent. We anticipate this relevant provisional patent will be filed at some point during the first half of 2023. Lipocure is currently in the process of working through the scale up of Probudur to a larger batch size. If Lipocure is able to achieve scale up of the enhanced formula, we anticipate IND enabling studies to commence towards the end of 2023.

Molecular Envelope Technology Enkephalin Intranasal Spray (EnveltaTM)



EnveltaTM is a nanotechnology-based intranasal spray drug product candidate which enables the delivery of a metabolically labile peptide drug (Enkephalin) into the brain. It is manufactured using high pressure homogenization and spray drying. There is pharmacological evidence of activity of MET enabled enkephalin in morphine-tolerant animals. Preclinical studies were conducted in animals for between 6 and 28 days through intravenous, oral and intranasal dosing. Twelve studies were conducted using three animal models whereby the animal studies were aimed at determining safety pharmacology and genetic toxicology. The preliminary data from these early animal studies of Envelta have shown that Envelta exhibited pain control in morphine tolerant animals, without the development of tolerance itself. These animal models tested the anti-hyperalgesic effects in rats against evoked stimuli in a model of chronic inflammatory pain and against ongoing neuropathic pain in a conditioned placement preference model with spinal nerve ligation. Envelta and morphine were compared at the same dose level of 7.5 mg kg-1 in this model and Envelta was determined to have a similar analgesic effect. With respect to respiratory depression, delta opioid receptor agonists may actually reverse the respiratory depression caused by morphine agonists, meaning that we believe Envelta will be unlikely to cause respiratory depression. However, there can be no assurances, based on these preclinical animal studies, that Envelta will be safe and effective. Further, there can be no assurance that Envelta will receive FDA approval.



We believe we have identified a large unmet need and market opportunity for current prescribers of opioids, including pain and hospice treatment centers. Currently, these prescribers may be using morphine-like opioids, which target three opioid receptors: mu, delta and kappa. Most analgesics used clinically target mu receptor, however, this receptor is also responsible for the majority of undesirable side effects associated with opioids. Currently, enkephalins are limited in their therapeutic potential by their pharmacokinetic profiles due to their inability to cross the blood-brain barrier to reach opioid receptors located in the central nervous system. However, we believe Envelta’s novel nasally delivered formulation, based on early animal studies, enhances enkephalin transport to the brain by protecting the drug in a molecular envelope (MET), facilitating its crossing of the blood-brain barrier. Enkephalins bind predominantly to the delta-receptor which is typically not associated with the dangers associated with opioids. We believe Envelta may have analgesic potential without opioid tolerance, and has not exhibited any indications of withdrawal, respiratory depression, euphoria, or addiction in the early animal studies. A study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) indicates, “Delta opioid receptors have a built-in mechanism for pain relief and can be precisely targeted with drug-delivering nanoparticles, making them a promising target for treating chronic inflammatory pain with fewer side effects.” There can be no assurances, based on these preclinical animal studies, that Envelta will be safe and effective in human trials.













Additionally, we believe Envelta may significantly reduce constipation and early animal clinical trials have not demonstrated any opioid dependence, drug seeking or respiratory depression. We plan to use the endogenous NCE regulatory pathway to bring this product candidate to market. We plan to target our marketing and selling efforts to pain specialists, anesthesiologists, orthopedics, surgeons, PCPs, Nurse Practitioners (“NPs”), oncologists, and neurologists within the $20 billion severe post cancer pain and non-cancer pain market.



Envelta is a neuroactive peptide drug product (enkephalin) with a proprietary composition formulated for administration by all routes except the topical route. A preassembled device and cartridge would be used to propel the enkephalin formulation through the nose to the brain via the olfactory nerve/bulb route of transmission. A MET will encapsulate the drug product, protecting it from degradation, and help to carry the drug across the blood-brain barrier to promptly suppress pain.



Image 4 and Image 5, below, display the planned delivery of enkephalin peptide nanoparticles to the brain via the olfactory route:

Image 6 below illustrates the concept Envelta delivery device:







Image 6



We may also develop Envelta for a second indication utilizing the same delivery mechanism as Envelta, which we refer to as PES200. PES200 enables the delivery of a metabolically labile peptide drug (Enkephalin) into the brain and is also covered under the same intellectual property listed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for Envelta. We believe PES200’s capabilities and attributes are the same as Envelta and we may be able to reference the Envelta PreIND and possible Phase I studies to open a potential PES200 IND followed by potential Phase II trials. Our plan is to validate proof-of-concept followed by IND-enabling studies for the development of a novel enkephalin-based formulation to treat Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
Current Development Status



On August 25, 2020, we entered into the CRADA with NCATS. This collaboration is for the continued development of our product candidate, Envelta, an intranasal peptide, for the management of acute and chronic non-cancer pain. The term of the CRADA is for a period of four years from the effective date of the agreement and can be terminated by both parties at any time by mutual written consent. In addition, either party may unilaterally terminate the CRADA at any time by providing written notice of at least sixty (60) days before the desired termination date. The agreement provides for studies that are focused on the pre-clinical characterization of Envelta as a novel analgesic for acute and chronic non-cancer pain, and for studies to further develop Envelta through IND enabling studies. There are certain development “Go/No Go” provisions within the agreement whereby, if certain events occur, or do not occur, NCATS may terminate the CRADA. These “No GO” provisions include: i) lack of efficacy in all animal pain models, ii) no reliable and sensitive bioanalytical method can be developed, iii) manufacturing failure due to inherent process scalability issues, iv) unacceptable toxicity or safety profile to enable clinical dosing, and v) inability to manufacture the Envelta dosage form.



With respect to NCATS rights to any invention made solely by an NCATS employee(s) or made jointly by an NCATS employee(s) and our employee(s), the CRADA grants to us an exclusive option to elect an exclusive or nonexclusive commercialization license. For inventions owned solely by NCATS or jointly by NCATS and us, and licensed pursuant to our option, we must grant to NCATS a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice the invention or have the invention practiced throughout the world by or on behalf of the United States government. For inventions made solely by an employee of ours, we grant to the United States government a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice the invention or have the invention practiced throughout the world by or on behalf of the United States government for research or other government purposes.











We believe Envelta and PES200 could support the current effort among prescribers, regulators, and patients to seek non-addictive treatment options for pain. We plan to utilize these delivery technologies to selectively develop a portfolio of patented 505(b)(2) and NCE candidates for commercialization. We intend to use these studies as a source for INDs for two additional potential indications, cancer pain and post-traumatic stress disorder. To date, all four planned in vitro studies have been successfully completed as well as the in vivo acute efficacy studies. In February 2022, we completed a 14-day intranasal dose range finding toxicity study of Envelta in rats with a 14-day recovery period which showed no adverse related findings in hematology, coagulation and serum chemistry data, with no treatment related toxicology findings or mortality noted. A 14-day intranasal dose range finding toxicity study of Envelta in dogs with a 14-day recovery period was also conducted and showed no adverse toxicologic findings. Bioavailability studies are anticipated to be completed by end of March 2023 and the in vivo chronic efficacy studies are being planned and are estimated to be completed sometime during the second half of 2023.



The preclinical manufacturing work being performed under the CRADA necessary to file the IND is ongoing. NCATS is working with its manufacturer on scaling up production of Envelta and anticipates completion of this task in the second half of 2023. We currently anticipate filing an IND with Envelta during the second quarter of 2024.



NobrXiol



NobrXiol is being developed by Nanomerics as an investigational formulation delivered via the nasal route to enhance Cannabidiol (“CBD”) transport to the brain. NobrXiol uses a preassembled device and cartridge system to propel the CBD powder formulation into the nose and to the brain via the olfactory nerve/bulb. This product candidate will be formulated to potentially treat seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome in patients two years of age and older. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome are rare central nervous system diseases considered serious epileptic encephalopathies that cause different types of epileptic seizures as well as cognitive and behavioral changes and are generally resistant to treatment. We plan to target our marketing and selling efforts to healthcare practitioners specializing in epilepsy within the $16.5 billion market for managing epilepsy in pediatrics and adults.



On April 21, 2022, we notified Nanomerics that the study aim of demonstrating the ability of Nanomerics platform technology delivering CBD to the brain via nasal administration in an animal model was met. Pursuant to the Nanomerics License Agreement - NobrXiol, we paid a milestone payment of $500,000 upon meeting this study aim in April 2022. We submitted the pre-IND Briefing Book with the FDA in October 2022 and received comments back from the FDA in December 2022. Upon our review of the FDA response letter, we now believe we have the appropriate guidance from the FDA to move forward with our overall development plan for this new product candidate and the ability to identify any need for further data prior to submitting the IND. Our current plan is to utilize potential grant awards to fund the development of NobrXiol through to an IND filing while we focus our cash resources on more immediate needs with regard to our other product candidates.



Diclofenac Epolamine Spray Film (Epoladerm)



We believe the Topical Spray Film Delivery Technology, which we refer to as Epoladerm, could provide a pathway for additional proprietary spray formulations with strong adhesion and accessibility properties upon application, especially around joints and curved body surfaces to manage pain associated with osteoarthritis. Our belief is based on, in part, research done to assess the effectiveness and safety of different preparations and doses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (“NSAIDs”), opioids, and paracetamol for knee and hip osteoarthritis pain and physical function to enable effective and safe use of these drugs at their lowest possible dose. Osteoarthritis, which we believe to be a better global market opportunity for us, is a painful condition that results in reduced physical function and quality of life and increased risk of all-cause mortality. A recent large meta-analysis on pharmacologic treatments for knee and hip osteoarthritis indicated that topical diclofenac had the largest effect on pain and physical function with a better safety profile than oral diclofenac. We believe these agents should be considered as a first-line pharmacological treatment for osteoarthritis.











We believe Epoladerm’s proprietary spray film technology may lead to adhesion capabilities superior to those of currently available transdermal patches (e.g. Epoladerm does not require any tape reinforcement), while maintaining comparable skin absorption capabilities to transdermal patches currently on the market. Specifically, because the Epoladerm technology does not require a patch to deliver the drug through the skin, we believe Epoladerm may have better adhesion to the skin and may have better accessibility, particularly around joints and other curved body surfaces. Additionally, because Epoladerm is a spray, we believe it will be more aesthetically appealing to patients than transdermal patches. As a spray, Epoladerm was studied in ex-vivo skin studies (skin from abdominoplasty) and recent studies indicate drying times of approximately 120 seconds for chronic osteoarthritis of the knee. Unlike other topical NSAIDs, Epoladerm does not require physical handling of the actual drug and enables dosing that provides an accurate amount of active ingredient per spray application.



Pursuant to a Research and Option Agreement with MedPharm Limited (the “MedPharm Research and Option Agreement”), MedPharm will conduct certain research and development activities of proprietary formulations incorporating certain MedPharm technologies and certain of our proprietary molecules. Under the agreement, we were granted an option to obtain an exclusive, world-wide, sub-licensable, royalty bearing, irrevocable license to research, develop, market, use, commercialize, and sell any product utilizing MedPharm’s spray formulation technology.



Image 1, below, displays the expected delivery system of Epoladerm for the treatment of chronic osteoarthritis:

When discussing nonopioid treatments for chronic pain, the Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”) notes clinicians should consider topical agents as alternative first-line analgesics, thought to be safer than systemic medications. In an August 18, 2020 article appearing in the Annals of Internal Medicine, the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians announced a joint clinical guideline, “Nonpharmacologic and Pharmacologic Management of Acute Pain from Non-Low Back, Musculoskeletal Injuries in Adults,” whereby they recommend topical NSAIDs as first-line therapy for patients experiencing pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries. The clinical guideline also recommends that clinicians not prescribe opioids for these injuries except in cases of severe injury or if patients cannot tolerate first-line therapeutic options.











As a result of pre-investigational new drug (“IND”) review, we believe it is reasonable for us to pursue a 505(b)(2) accelerated new drug application (“NDA”) for Epoladerm. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing regulatory approval under the 505(b)(2) pathway or that we will be successful in mitigating risks associated with the clinical development of this product candidate.



Current Development Status



In December 2021, we completed a single dose pharmacokinetic study of dermal administration of Epoladerm in minipigs as part of the required IND enabling trials. Single-dose transdermal delivery of Epoladerm was well-tolerated in all minipigs and no treatment-related clinical observations, changes in body weight, or dermal irritation were observed. All Epoladerm treated animals had plasma levels of Epoladerm confirming transdermal absorption. The maximum plasma concentration (“Cmax”) was reached at 4 hours post-dose, and plasma Epoladerm remained at 24-hour post-dose for all animals.



In January 2022, we reported positive results of four preclinical dermal safety studies for Epoladerm. Researchers concluded that once daily dermal administration of Epoladerm for 28 days was well-tolerated with no serious adverse findings. The studies were performed by Charles River Laboratories, a well-known clinical research organization. The studies included a skin irritation study in rabbits; a dermal sensitization assessment in guinea pigs; and a phototoxicity assay in mouse fibroblasts. Epoladerm was well tolerated in each of the studies and no reportable dermal irritation, dermal sensitization or phototoxicity was observed.



In June 2022, we announced our intention to pursue a direct to Over-the-Counter (“OTC”) regulatory pathway for Epoladerm. The direct to OTC, non-prescription regulatory pathway is expected to provide a faster drug development timeline and faster global approval track than the prescription pathway we had originally pursued for Epoladerm. To support the OTC application, we plan to submit Epoladerm’s completed dermal toxicity, sensitization, irritation, phototoxicity studies and its pharmacokinetic characteristics to the FDA. In addition, we anticipate that we will have to complete a consumer preference assessment and a pivotal study required by the FDA’s Office of Non-prescription Drugs. The originally scheduled preclinical toxicology studies for an osteoarthritis of the knee indication that were to run in parallel with our anticipated pilot study for Epoladerm will not be required for our direct to OTC regulatory pathway.



We made the determination to delay our First-in-Human study investigating Epoladerm for pain associated with chronic osteoarthritis odue to: (i) a delay in procuring the active pharmaceutical ingredient necessary for the drug product candidate, (ii) delays related to supply chain disruptions, and (iii) an extensive review of the formulation and potential degradants resulting in MedPharm replacing the potential degradant. This additional formulation work and permeation testing may enable the patent coverage of this asset to be extended until at least 2042. MedPharm is anticipated to complete the formulation work and permeation testing at the end of third quarter 2023. If this nonclinical testing is successful, we plan to file an IND with Epoladerm in the fourth quarter 2023. In addition, MedPharm will initiate manufacturing batches that will be utilized for the First-in-Human study that is anticipated to begin first quarter 2024.



We may seek to license out or partner this asset as we continue to focus our efforts on our prescription drug pipeline.



High-Density Molecular Masking Spray Formulation for the Prevention of Respiratory Viruses (AnQlar)



AnQlar is a high-density molecular masking spray we plan to develop as an anti-viral barrier to potentially prevent, or reduce the risk or the intensity of, viral infections in humans. We intend for this formulation to be delivered using a preassembled device and cartridge to propel the high-density molecular spray formulation into the nose. We intend for AnQlar to be used as a nasal powder spray to potentially prevent viral binding to epithelial cells in the nasal cavity and the upper respiratory tract, potentially reducing respiratory related infections.











As an addition to standard personal protective equipment, we believe AnQlar may offer an additional layer of protection, in the form of a molecular mask, to protect healthcare workers and those at risk of serious disease from viral infections. AnQlar has completed IND-enabling toxicology studies and ex-vivo studies which demonstrated a reduction in infectivity from respiratory viruses like influenza and SARS-CoV-2. During the ex-vivo study, in the presence of AnQlar, SARS-CoV-2 viral replication inhibition was observed in a bronchial epithelial model reconstituted from healthy human donor cells. Virus replication was evaluated using RT-qPCR. The data was presented as a number of viral copies per ml. A lower viral yield was detected in the cultures treated with AnQlar than in the control with phosphate buffered saline (“PBS”) after 72 hours of infection. AnQlar could potentially be marketed to first responders, healthcare workers, clinics, military forces, transplant and other immune compromised or at risk patients within the $13 billion (as of 2019) anti-viral market.



Image 7 below illustrates the results of the AnQlar IND-enabling toxicology studies ex-vivo:







Image 7



A lower viral yield was detected in the cultures treated with AnQlar than in the control with Phosphate Buffered Saline (“PBS”) after 72 hours of infection.



Current Development Status



We submitted and received a written pre-investigational new drug (“pre-IND”) response from the FDA for AnQlar. In its pre-IND response, the FDA provided guidance on our pathway to pursue prophylactic treatment against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza for daily use as an OTC product. We believe the results of the pre-IND response support further research on AnQlar as a once daily intranasal prophylactic treatment of viral infections. The FDA has indicated that, upon successful completion of all necessary preclinical and clinical trials, we may pursue an NDA drug approval with the Office of Non-Prescription Drugs.



In August 2021, we engaged Syneos Health to assist with the design of the optimal clinical trial to facilitate an efficient regulatory and development timeline for AnQlar.



On August 25, 2021, we entered into a commercial manufacturing and supply agreement with Seqens, an integrated global leader in pharmaceutical solutions with 24 manufacturing sites worldwide and seven research and development facilities throughout the U.S. and Europe. The agreement with Seqens provides for both the supply material for our clinical studies as well as the long-term commercial supply of AnQlar. Seqens has initiated and is conducting process development and validation of additional large scale commercial quantities of AnQlar at its facilities in Devens and Newburyport, Massachusetts.











On September 29, 2021, we engaged a research and development firm to conduct a series of IND enabling toxicity studies for AnQlar which are expected to be completed by the fourth quarter 2023. This was slightly delayed due to certain issues with finalizing the bioanalytical method development of the product candidate. Upon successful completion of these studies, we intend to run a process using an investment banker to assist with sublicensing AnQlar to a global commercial partner in the respiratory space.



On July 5, 2022, we announced our intention to pursue an OTC Intranasal Medical Device Consumer regulatory pathway for AnQlar. To support the OTC Medical Device application, we plan to submit AnQlar’s completed in-vitro study, ex-vivo study using human mucosal cells, in-vivo study in rats, toxicology study and its pharmacokinetics (PK) characteristics studies to the FDA. Additionally, we will include AnQlar’s completed safety-pharmacology studies, drug-drug interaction studies and its virology studies evaluating AnQlar’s viral barrier properties against two variants of SARS-CoV-2 in a SARS-CoV-2 mouse model to the FDA. For the OTC medical device application, we anticipate that we will have to complete stability testing, human factors testing for medical devices, safety studies and supplementary in-vitro studies.



We recently conducted an initial review of the results from a preclinical virology study conducted by one of our CROs where we were evaluating the viral barrier properties of AnQlar™ versus two variants of the SARS CoV-2 virus. This review conducted by our external consultants indicates that the test article (AnQlar) shows an appropriate level of virus deactivation for a prophylactic viral barrier product candidate which was the outcome we were expecting.



We continue to seek opportunities to exploit our product portfolio through licensing and other strategic transactions to further develop our drug product candidates. This includes seeking potential partners in further developing our drug product candidates and responding to inquiries of interest we have received concerning our product portfolio.

The patents contains composition claims to pharmaceutical compositions having an external storage solution containing an active pharmaceutical ingredient and particles of liposomes embedded in a polymeric matrix contained within the storage solution.
Envelta



The product candidate is covered by the following patent families which protect the chemistry of the MET polymer and its use in pharmaceutical products: Patent Family 1 includes US Patent No. 7,741,474 (expires March 18, 2026), and a Japanese Patent, Canadian Patent and European Patent (all which expire September 22, 2023). This patent family covers carbohydrate polymers with hydrophobic and hydrophilic side-groups suitable for solubilizing, for example, hydrophobic drugs.



Patent Family 2 includes US Patent No. 8,470,371 (expires July 29, 2029) and a Japanese Patent (expires August 8, 2027) and a European Patent (which expire August 8, 2027). This family covers both composition and method claims for amphiphilic carbohydrate polymers which are capable of self-assembling to form micellar clusters in which the carbohydrate amphiphiles aggregate into hierarchically organized micellar clusters of individual aggregates. These micellar clusters formed by the aggregation of individual micelles may be transformed into stable nanoparticles with drugs, especially hydrophobic drugs that have poor aqueous solubility. This provides molar polymer/drug ratios that are greater than the ratios observed with block copolymers and improve the transfer of hydrophobic drugs across biological barriers.



Patent Family 3 includes US Patent Nos. 8,278,277 (expires August 16, 2030) and 8,920,819 (expires April 29, 2029), a Canadian patent (expires March 1, 2030) and a pending European application (which would expire March 1, 2030). This family covers lipophilic derivatives of hydrophilic drugs comprising a hydrophilic drug and a cleavable linker as well as methods of treatment using these compositions. In particular, the patents relate to compositions of a lipophilic derivative of the hydrophilic neuropeptide Leucine [5]-Enkephalin and an amphiphile compound, where the derivative includes a lipophilic linker attached to the side chain oxygen of the tyrosine in the Leucine [5]-Enkephalin, and where the amphiphile compound is quaternary palmitoyl glycol chitosan (GCPQ).



Patent Family 4 includes US Patent No. 10,213,474 (expires November 3, 2034), a Japanese patent (expires November 3, 2034), a European patent (expires November 3, 2034) and a Canadian patent ( expires November 3, 2034). The patents cover methods for treating pain, comprising intranasally administering to a human or animal a composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a hydrophilic neuroactive peptide and an amphiphilic quaternary ammonium palmitoyl glycol chitosan (GCPQ); wherein the amphiphilic GCPQ is capable of self-assembly in aqueous media into particles having a mean particle size between 20-500 nm; where intranasally administering the composition delivers the hydrophilic neuroactive peptide to the brain of the human or animal.



Patent Family 5 includes national phase filings of WO 2021/1234413 which includes patent applications in the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan and China. These patent applications cover acetylated amphiphilic carbohydrate compounds of average molecular weight 1-50 kDa which is based on a glycol chitosan, wherein the levels of acetylation can be modified. The compound can be formulated with hydrophobic compounds where the degree of acetylation of the carbohydrate compound is optimized to maximize solubilization of the compounds. 



In addition to the patent families which protect the chemistry of the MET polymer and its use in pharmaceutical products there is a patent family which covers the delivery device that can be used to administer the pharmaceutical compositions including US Patent No. 8,695,592 (expires October 11, 2029), and a European patent (expires October 11, 2029). This family covers a capsule for use in dispensing a drug which has a pressurized container for a fluid, a chamber for containing a particulate, at least one channel running between the container and the chamber to provide fluidic communication and at least two distinct concave surfaces which impart rotational motion to a fluid flow so that within the chamber a rotationally turbulent flow of fluid is produced in order to engage with the particulate and to produce a mobile fluid comprising the particulate.











AnQlar 



This product candidate is specifically covered by a PCT application WO 2022/043678A1 which describes a molecular masking spray for use as an anti-viral barrier to potentially prevent, or reduce the risk or the intensity of, viral infections in humans. Depending on the formulation and mode of administration of AnQlar, the product candidate may also be covered by many of the patents and patent application which cover Envelta.



NobrXiol



This product candidate is specifically covered by a provisional patent application which describes compositions containing an amphiphilic carbohydrate compound and a cannabinoid which may be intranasally delivered. Depending on the formulation and of NobrXiol, the product candidate may also be covered by many of the patents and patent application which cover Envelta



Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for regularly filed applications in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, delay in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.



Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees, contractors, consultants and advisors and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our collaborators, contractors and selected consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our collaborators, employees, contractors and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.



Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our drugs or processes, or to obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future drugs may have an adverse impact on us. If third parties have prepared and filed patent applications prior to the date of our earliest filed patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO, to determine priority of invention. For more information, please see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”

Sales and Marketing



If Epoladerm, Probudur, Envelta, PES200, AnQlar and/or NobrXiol are approved, we plan to enter into sales and marketing agreements with one or several pharmaceutical companies to sell to pain management clinics and specialists, general and orthopedic surgeons, anesthesiologists, primary care physicians (“PCPs”), Nurse Practitioners (“NPs”), oncologists, and neurologists.



On August 30, 2018, we entered into a Master Service Agreement (the “MSA”) with INC Research, LLC, a Syneos Health™ group company (“Syneos Health”) to operate as our Contract Sales Organization (“CSO”). Services provided by Syneos Health include clinical research services, bioanalytical analysis, statistics, validations, pharmacokinetics, and/or consulting, advertising, and public relations (communications), field team sales and education recruiting and deployment, and patient adherence services.



Manufacturing



Envelta is an intranasal spray and we rely on third-party contractors for manufacturing clinical supplies and plan to do so for commercial amounts also.



On August 25, 2021, we entered into a commercial manufacturing and supply agreement with Seqens, an integrated global leader in pharmaceutical solutions with 24 manufacturing sites worldwide and seven research and development facilities throughout the U.S. and Europe. The agreement with Seqens provides for both the supply material for our clinical studies as well as the long-term commercial supply of AnQlar. Seqens will conduct process development and validation of additional large scale commercial quantities of AnQlar at its facilities in Devens and Newburyport, Massachusetts.











We continue to explore manufacturing sources, in order to ensure that we have access to sufficient manufacturing capacity in order to meet potential demand for any of our product candidates in a cost-efficient manner. We plan to secure supply sources and contract with these or other parties to manufacture commercial quantities of any products we successfully develop. Among the conditions for FDA approval of a pharmaceutical product is the requirement that the manufacturer’s quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP, which must be followed at all times. The FDA typically inspects manufacturing facilities on an ongoing basis. In complying with Current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) regulations, pharmaceutical manufacturers must expend resources and time to ensure compliance with product specifications as well as production, record keeping, quality control, reporting, and other requirements.



Competition



The pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We will continue to face competition from various global pharmaceutical, biotechnology, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies that engage in drug development activities. Our key competitors include Pacira Biosciences, Inc. (which developed EXPAREL®) and Horizon (which developed Pennsaid®). Many of our competitors have similar products that focus on the same diseases and conditions that our current and future pipeline product candidates address. Many of our competitors have greater financial flexibility to deploy capital in certain areas as well as more commercial and other resources, marketing and manufacturing organizations, and larger research and development staff. As a result, these companies may be able to pursue strategies or approvals that we are not able to finance or otherwise pursue and may receive FDA, or other applicable regulatory approvals more efficiently or rapidly than us. Also, our competitors may have more experience in marketing and selling their products post-approval and gaining market acceptance more quickly. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Our product candidates could become less competitive if our competitors are able to license or acquire technology that is more effective or less costly and thereby offer an improved or a cheaper alternative to our product candidates.



We expect any product candidates that we develop and commercialize will compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. We also expect to face competition in our efforts to identify appropriate collaborators or partners to help commercialize our product candidate portfolio in our target commercial markets.



Government Regulation and Approval Process



Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level, including the FDA, the FTC and the DEA, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we market. For both currently marketed and future products, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can, among other things, result in suspension of regulatory approval and possible civil and criminal sanctions. Regulations, enforcement positions, statutes and legal interpretations applicable to the pharmaceutical industry are constantly evolving and are not always clear. Significant changes in regulations, enforcement positions, statutes and legal interpretations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.



Additionally, future healthcare legislation or other legislative proposals at the federal and state levels could bring about major changes in the affected health care systems, including statutory restrictions on the means that can be employed by brand and generic pharmaceutical companies to settle Paragraph IV patent litigations. We cannot predict the outcome of such initiatives, but such initiatives, if passed, could result in significant costs to us in terms of costs of compliance and penalties associated with failure to comply.



With the support of President Trump and the HHS, the NIH launched the initiative Helping to End Addiction Long-term (“HEAL”), to provide solutions to the national opioid crisis. With the focus on ending the opioid crisis in America, HEAL, and new FDA guidance has made it more efficient to bring novel non-opioid medication to market.











The Office of National Drug Control Policy (“ONDCP”) is a component of the Executive Office of the President which works to reduce drug use and its consequences by leading and coordinating the development, implementation, and assessment of U.S. drug policy. In addition to its vital ongoing work, ONDCP also provided administrative and financial support to the President’s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis, established by Executive Order on March 29, 2017 by President Donald J. Trump. This commission was created to make recommendations to the President on how to best combat opioid addiction and abuse. In August 2017, the commission issued a preliminary report calling on President Trump to officially declare the crisis of opioid abuse a national emergency. On October 26, 2017, President Trump declared the opioid crisis a “national public health emergency.” The commission’s final report was released in early November 2017. In July 2017, the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, a trade association representing pharmacy benefit managers, wrote a letter to the commissioner of FDA in which it expressed support for, among other things, the CDC guidelines and a seven-day limit on the supply of opioids for acute pain. In September 2018, CVS Pharmacy announced that it would only fill first time opioid prescriptions for acute pain for a seven-day supply.



Law enforcement and regulatory agencies may apply policies that seek to limit the availability of opioids. This creates the potential for aggressive enforcement, unfavorable publicity regarding the use or misuse of opioid drugs or the limitations of abuse-deterrent formulations, litigation, public inquiries or investigations related to the abuse, sales, marketing, distribution or storage of opioid products.



In addition, efforts by the FDA and other regulatory bodies to combat the abuse of opioids will positively impact the market for our novel non-opioid and non-addictive product candidates. We expect that the FDA will continue to evaluate the impact of abuse-deterrent opioids in the future, and this could impose further restrictions to opioid products currently on the market, which may include changing labeling, imposing additional prescribing restrictions, or seeking a product’s removal from the market.



Coinciding with HEAL, there is new FDA guidance that streamlines and broadens the range of novel non-opioid medications. The first guidance will address medications that can reduce the use of opioids in the treatment of acute pain, including how sponsors can demonstrate a clinically meaningful reduction in the use of opioid pain medications in the acute setting. The second guidance will focus on assessing the benefits and risks of developing new opioid pain drugs, including drafting an updated framework for evaluating the risks associated with intentional or illicit misuse or abuse of these substances. The third guidance will “outline a path for developing extended-release local anesthetics,” including clinical pharmacology, proper evaluation of safety and efficacy, and the types of studies that may support approval of these product candidates. Finally, FDA will issue guidance on the development of “new non-opioid pain medications for acute and chronic pain that can provide therapeutic alternatives to the use of opioids.”



Pharmaceutical Regulation in the United States



In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, Warning Letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.



FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug or a generic version of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States.



The process required by the FDA before a new drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves:




● | Completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s current GLP regulations; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Approval by an IRB at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the FDA to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each intended use; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with the FDA’s cGMP regulations to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Submission to the FDA of an NDA; 
--+-------------------------------------


● | Satisfactory completion of a potential review by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA. 
--+----------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies



When developing a branded product and bringing it to market, the first step in proceeding to clinical studies is preclinical testing. Preclinical tests are intended to provide a laboratory or animal study evaluation of the product to determine its chemistry, formulation and stability. Toxicology studies are also performed to assess the potential safety of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLPs. The results of these studies are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND application is submitted.
Clinical Trials



Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it initiates at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on their website, www.ClinicalTrials.gov.



Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:




● | Phase I: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase II: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase III: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.











Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information



Sponsors of certain clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on www.ClinicalTrials.gov. Information related to the product, subject population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss certain results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
Marketing Approval



After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include, among other things, the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer or sponsor under an approved NDA is also subject to annual program fees. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to payment of additional user fees. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs through a two-tiered classification system, Standard Review and Priority Review. Priority Review designation is given to drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness over existing therapies. The FDA endeavors to review most applications subject to Standard Review within ten to twelve months whereas the FDA’s goal is to review most Priority Review applications within six to eight months, depending on whether the drug is a new molecular entity.



The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. Before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the NDA unless it determines that the manufacturing process and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective for the labeled indication.



After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter to indicate that the application is not ready for approval. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that an application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If, or when, the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.



As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a REMS to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. If the FDA determines a REMS is necessary during review of the application, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug’s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, or other elements to assure safe use, such as special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to periodically assess the strategy. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a drug.











Moreover, as a condition of product approval, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing, known as Phase IV testing, and/or surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy, and the FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or certain problems are identified following initial marketing. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling, and, even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product or impose other conditions, including labeling or distribution restrictions or other risk-management mechanisms.



Further changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the similar procedures in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.



Post-Approval Requirements



Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to drug listing and registration, recordkeeping, periodic safety reporting, product sampling and distribution, adverse event reporting and advertising, marketing and promotion, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in a manner consistent with the provisions of the approved labeling. While physicians may prescribe for off-label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. There also are extensive DEA regulations applicable to controlled substances.



Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is also required following FDA approval of an NDA. Additionally, the FDA may place conditions on an approval, in addition to REMS programs of Phase IV testing, that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments and list their marketed products with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs, including quality control and manufacturing processes. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drug’s benefits outweigh its risks. In addition, regulatory authorities may take other enforcement action, including, among other things, Warning Letters, the seizure of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.



The Hatch-Waxman Amendments



505(b)(2) NDAs



The FDA is authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference from the data owner. The applicant may rely upon the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy for an approved product that acts as the “listed drug.” The FDA may also require 505(b)(2) applicants to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the listed drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the conditions of use for which the branded reference drug has been approved, or for a new condition of use sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.
Abbreviated New Drug Applications (“ANDAs”)



The Hatch-Waxman amendments to the FDCA established a statutory procedure for submission and FDA review and approval of ANDAs for generic versions of listed drugs. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API\I”), drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. Premarket applications for generic drugs are termed abbreviated because they generally do not include clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. However, a generic manufacturer is typically required to conduct bioequivalence studies of its test product against the listed drug. Bioequivalence is established when there is an absence of a significant difference in the rate and extent for absorption of the generic product and the reference listed drug. For some drugs, other means of demonstrating bioequivalence may be required by the FDA, especially where rate or extent of absorption are difficult or impossible to measure. The FDA will approve an ANDA application if it finds that the generic product does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the reference listed drug. A product is not eligible for ANDA approval if the FDA determines that it is not bioequivalent to the reference listed drug if it is intended for a different use or if it is not subject to, and requires, an approved Suitability Petition.
Patent Exclusivity and Orange Book Listing



In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA (i) that there is no patent listed with the FDA as covering the relevant branded product, (ii) that any patent listed as covering the branded product has expired, (iii) that the patent listed as covering the branded product will expire prior to the marketing of the generic product, in which case the ANDA will not be finally approved by the FDA until the expiration of such patent or (iv) that any patent listed as covering the branded drug is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, sale or use of the generic product for which the ANDA is submitted. A notice of the Paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii” statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.



If the reference NDA holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the Paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the Paragraph IV certification, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired as described in further detail below.



Non-Patent Exclusivity



In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug.



For example, a drug that is considered new chemical entity (NCE) at the time of approval may be awarded a five-year period of marketing exclusivity, starting at the time of product approval. An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application referencing that drug may not be approved until the five-year period expires. Also, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application referencing that drug may not filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years, unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval.











A drug, including one approved under Section 505(b)(2), may obtain a three-year period of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant.



DEA Regulation



Our product candidates may be regulated as “controlled substances” as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended, which establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution and other requirements administered by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (the “DEA”). The DEA is concerned with, among other things, the control of handlers of controlled substances and with the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce.



The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. The manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use of Schedule II drugs are subject to a high degree of regulation. For example, Schedule X drug prescriptions generally must be signed by a physician and may not be refilled without a new prescription. Substances in Schedule IV are considered to have a lower potential for abuse relative to substances in Schedule II. A prescription for controlled substances in Schedule IV may be issued by a practitioner through oral communication, in writing or by facsimile to the pharmacist and may be refilled if so, authorized on the prescription or by call-in. In the future, our other potential products may also be listed by the DEA as controlled substances.



Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized.



The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances and periodic reports must be made to the DEA, including, for example, distribution reports for Schedule II controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics and other designated substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance and authorization must be obtained to destroy any controlled substance. In addition, special authorization and notification requirements apply to imports and exports.



In addition, a DEA quota system controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule II. Distributions of any Schedule II controlled substance must also be accompanied by special order forms, with copies provided to the DEA. The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much of a Schedule II substance may be produced in total in the United States based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. This limited aggregate amount of any particular Schedule II substance that the DEA allows to be produced in the United States each year is allocated among individual companies, who must submit applications annually to the DEA for individual production and procurement quotas. We and our contract manufacturers must receive an annual quota from the DEA in order to produce or procure any Schedule II substance for use in manufacturing. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. Our and our contract manufacturers’ quota of an active ingredient may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials. Any delay or refusal by the DEA in establishing our and our contract manufacturers’ quota for controlled substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product launches, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.











To meet its responsibilities, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could result in criminal proceedings.



Individual states also regulate controlled substances, and we and our contract manufacturers will be subject to state regulation on distribution of these products.



Pricing and Reimbursement



Successful commercialization of our products depends, in part, on the availability of governmental and third-party payor reimbursement for the cost of our products. Government authorities and third-party payors increasingly are challenging the price of medical products and services. On the government side, there is a heightened focus, at both the federal and state levels, on decreasing costs and reimbursement rates for Medicaid, Medicare and other government insurance programs. This has led to an increase in federal and state legislative initiatives related to drug prices, which could significantly influence the purchase of pharmaceutical products, resulting in lower prices and changes in product demand. If enacted, these changes could lead to reduced payments to pharmaceutical manufacturers. Many states have also created preferred drug lists and include drugs on those lists only when the manufacturers agree to pay a supplemental rebate. If our current products or future drug candidates are not included on these preferred drug lists, physicians may not be inclined to prescribe them to their Medicaid patients, thereby diminishing the potential market for our products.



In addition, third-party payors have been imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and limiting reimbursement levels for pharmaceutical products. Third-party payors may require manufacturers to provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and limit coverage to specific pharmaceutical products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved pharmaceutical products for particular indications. Third-party payors may challenge the price and examine the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical products in addition to their safety and efficacy. Manufacturers may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical products in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable manufacturers to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on their investment in drug development.



Healthcare Reform



In the United States, there have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last several years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system of the United States. It is uncertain what other legislative proposals may be adopted or what actions federal, state, or private payors may take in response to any healthcare reform proposals or legislation. We cannot predict the effect such reforms may have on our business, and no assurance can be given that any such reforms will not have a material adverse effect.



By way of example, in March 2010, the ACA was signed into law, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for drug products under government health care programs. The law includes measures that (i) significantly increase Medicaid rebates through both the expansion of the program and significant increases in rebates, (ii) substantially expand the Public Health System (340B) program to allow other entities to purchase prescription drugs at substantial discounts, (iii) extend the Medicaid rebate rate to a significant portion of Managed Medicaid enrollees, (iv) assess a rebate on Medicaid Part D spending in the coverage gap for branded and authorized generic prescription drugs, and (v) levy a significant excise tax on the industry to fund the healthcare reform.











Additionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. On September 9, 2021, the Biden Administration published a wide-ranging list of policy proposals, most of which would need to be carried out by Congress, to reduce drug prices and drug payment. The United States Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) plan includes, among other reform measures, proposals to lower prescription drug prices, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate prices and disincentivizing price increases, and to support market changes that strengthen supply chains, promote biosimilars and generic drugs, and increase price transparency. These initiatives recently culminated in the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act (the “IRA”) in August 2022, which will, among other things, allow the HHS to negotiate the selling price of certain drugs and biologics that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) reimburses under Medicare Part B and Part D, although only high-expenditure single-source drugs that have been approved for at least 7 years (11 years for biologics) can be selected by CMS for negotiation, with the negotiated price taking effect two years after the selection year. The negotiated prices, which will first become effective in 2026, will be capped at a statutory ceiling price beginning in October 2023, penalize drug manufacturers that increase prices of Medicare Part B and Part D drugs at a rate greater than the rate of inflation. The IRA permits the Secretary of HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties. The IRA also extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges.



Healthcare Regulations



Pharmaceutical companies are subject to various federal and state laws that are intended to combat health care fraud and abuse and that govern certain of our business practices, especially our interactions with third-party payors, healthcare providers, patients, customers and potential customers through sales and marketing or research and development activities. These include anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, sunshine laws, privacy laws and FDA regulation of advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products.



Anti-kickback laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, make it a criminal offense knowingly and willfully to offer, pay, solicit, or receive any remuneration to induce or reward referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service reimbursable by, a federal health care program (including our products). The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are several statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. The penalties for violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include administrative civil money penalties, imprisonment for up to five years, fines of up to $25,000 per violation and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.



The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to the federal government (including Medicare and Medicaid) that are false or fraudulent (and, under the Federal False Claims Act, a claim is deemed false or fraudulent if it is made pursuant to an illegal kickback). Manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in significant monetary penalties, including fines ranging from $11,181 to $22,363 for each false claim, and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other improper sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. In addition, companies have been forced to implement extensive corrective action plans and have often become subject to consent decrees or corporate integrity agreements, severely restricting the manner in which they conduct their business. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.











The Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services. Noncompliance can result in civil money penalties of up to $15,270 for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service and exclusion from the federal healthcare programs.



Federal criminal statutes prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the ACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.



Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, including state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to products and services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including commercial payors. Additionally, there are state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or that otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers as well as state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report marketing expenditures or pricing information.



Sunshine laws, including the Federal Open Payments law enacted as part of the ACA, require pharmaceutical manufacturers to disclose payments and other transfers of value to physicians and certain other health care providers or professionals, and in the case of some state sunshine laws, restrict or prohibit certain such payments. Pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to submit reports to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year. Failure to submit the required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $165,786 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1.105 million per year for “knowing failures”) for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations. Certain states and foreign governments require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.



Privacy laws, such as the privacy regulations implemented under HIPAA, restrict covered entities from using or disclosing protected health information. Covered entities commonly include physicians, hospitals and health insurers from which we may seek to acquire data to aid in our research, development, sales and marketing activities. Although pharmaceutical manufacturers are not covered entities under HIPAA, our ability to acquire or use protected health information from covered entities may be affected by privacy laws. Specifically, HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.



Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.



The FDA regulates the sale and marketing of prescription drug products and, among other things, prohibits pharmaceutical manufacturers from making false or misleading statements and from promoting products for unapproved uses. There has been an increase in government enforcement efforts at both the federal and state level. Numerous cases have been brought against pharmaceutical manufacturers under the Federal False Claims Act, alleging, among other things, that certain sales or marketing-related practices violate the Anti-Kickback Statute or the FDA’s regulations, and many of these cases have resulted in settlement agreements under which the companies were required to change certain practices, pay substantial fines and operate under the supervision of a federally appointed monitor for a period of years. Due to the breadth of these laws and their implementing regulations and the absence of guidance in some cases, it is possible that our practices might be challenged by government authorities. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by civil and criminal sanctions including fines, civil monetary penalties, as well as the possibility of exclusion of our products from payment by federal health care programs.











Government Price Reporting



Government regulations regarding reporting and payment obligations are complex, and we are continually evaluating the methods we use to calculate and report the amounts owed with respect to Medicaid and other government pricing programs. Our calculations are subject to review and challenge by various government agencies and authorities, and it is possible that any such review could result either in material changes to the method used for calculating the amounts owed to such agency or the amounts themselves. Because the process for making these calculations, and our judgments supporting these calculations, involve subjective decisions, these calculations are subject to audit. In the event that a government authority challenges or finds ambiguity with regard to our report of payments, such authority may impose civil and criminal sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. From time to time we conduct routine reviews of our government pricing calculations. These reviews may have an impact on government price reporting and rebate calculations used to comply with various government regulations regarding reporting and payment obligations.



Many governments and third-party payors reimburse the purchase of certain prescription drugs based on a drug’s AWP. In the past several years, state and federal government agencies have conducted ongoing investigations of manufacturers’ reporting practices with respect to AWP, which they have suggested have led to excessive payments by state and federal government agencies for prescription drugs. We and numerous other pharmaceutical companies have been named as defendants in various state and federal court actions alleging improper or fraudulent practices related to the reporting of AWP.



Drug Pedigree Laws



State and federal governments have proposed or passed various drug pedigree laws which can require the tracking of all transactions involving prescription drugs from the manufacturer to the pharmacy (or other dispensing) level. Companies are required to maintain records documenting the chain of custody of prescription drug products beginning with the purchase of such products from the manufacturer. Compliance with these pedigree laws requires implementation of extensive tracking systems as well as heightened documentation and coordination with customers and manufacturers. While we fully intend to comply with these laws, there is uncertainty about future changes in legislation and government enforcement of these laws. Failure to comply could result in fines or penalties, as well as loss of business that could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
Federal Regulation of Patent Litigation Settlements and Authorized Generic Arrangements



As part of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, companies are required to file with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) certain types of agreements entered into between brand and generic pharmaceutical companies related to the settlement of patent litigation or manufacture, marketing and sale of generic versions of branded drugs. This requirement could affect the manner in which generic drug manufacturers resolve intellectual property litigation and other disputes with brand pharmaceutical companies and could result generally in an increase in private-party litigation against pharmaceutical companies or additional investigations or proceedings by the FTC or other governmental authorities.
Other



The U.S. federal government, various states and localities have laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of pharmaceuticals, as well as regulations dealing with the substitution of generic drugs for branded drugs. Our operations are also subject to regulation, licensing requirements and inspection by the states and localities in which our operations are located or in which we conduct business.



Certain of our activities are also subject to FTC enforcement actions. The FTC also enforces a variety of antitrust and consumer protection laws designed to ensure that the nation’s markets function competitively, are vigorous, efficient and free of undue restrictions. Federal, state, local and foreign laws of general applicability, such as laws regulating working conditions, also govern us.











In addition, we are subject to numerous and increasingly stringent federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and the cleanup of contamination. We are required to maintain and comply with environmental permits and controls for some of our operations, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by the issuing authorities. Our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future as a result of changes in environmental laws and regulations or increased manufacturing activities at any of our facilities. We could incur significant costs or liabilities as a result of any failure to comply with environmental laws, including fines, penalties, third-party claims and the costs of undertaking a clean-up at a current or former site or at a site to which our wastes were transported. In addition, we have grown in part by acquisition, and our diligence may not have identified environmental impacts from historical operations at sites we have acquired in the past or may acquire in the future.



Human Capital Resources



As of March 21, 2023, we have a total of 7 full time employees and one contractor. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees, and none are represented by labor unions. We consider our current relations with our employees to be good.



We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. In particular, we depend on the skills, experience and performance of our senior management and research personnel. We compete for qualified personnel with other medical pharmaceutical, and healthcare companies, as well as universities and non-profit research institutions.



We provide competitive compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by country/region and employment classification) include incentive compensation plans, healthcare and insurance benefits, retirement investments, paid time off, and family leave, among others. We also use targeted equity-based grants with vesting conditions to facilitate retention of personnel, particularly for our key employees.



The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health and safety of our employees. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations.

Our principal address is 1055 Westlakes Drive, Suite 300, Berwyn, PA 19312.
