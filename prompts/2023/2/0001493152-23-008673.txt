ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Company Overview and Principal Products and Services
 
Perma-Fix Environmental Services, Inc. (the Company, which may be referred to as we, us, or our), a Delaware corporation incorporated in December 1990, is an environmental and environmental technology know-how company.
 
The principal element of our business strategy consists of upgrading our facilities within our Treatment Segment to increase efficiency and modernize and expand treatment capabilities to meet the changing markets associated with the waste management industry. Within our Services Segment, we continue to bid on projects, increase competitive procurement effectiveness and broaden the market penetration within both the commercial and government sectors. The Company continues to remain focused on expansion into both commercial and international markets to supplement government spending in the United States of America (“USA”), from which a significant portion of the Company’s revenue is derived. This includes new services, new customers and increased market share in our current markets.
 
COVID-19 and Other Impacts
 
Our 2022 financial results continued to be impacted by COVID-19, among other things. Our Treatment Segment began to see steady improvements in waste receipts starting in the second quarter of 2022 from certain customers who had previously delayed waste shipments due, in part, from the impact of COVID-19. This positive trend was negatively impacted by occurrences of severe weather conditions which resulted in temporary delays in waste shipments from certain customers and a temporary shortage in skilled production personnel which peaked through the fourth quarter of 2022 at one of our facilities. In early part of 2022, our Services Segment continued to experience delays/curtailments in project work by certain customers since the award of projects to us late in the second quarter of 2021 due to COVID-19 impact and/or administrative delays. However, starting in the second quarter of 2022, work under these projects had resumed/increased as the pandemic impacts began to subside and has since reached full operational status. In 2022, we continued to realize delays in procurement and planning on behalf of our government clients that saw easing through the second half of the year. Heading into 2023, we expect to see continued improvements in waste receipts and continued increases in project work from contracts recently won and bids submitted in both segments that are awaiting awards, subject to potential COVID-19 and economic impacts. (See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – COVID-19 and Other Impact” for a full discussion of COVID-19 and other impacts on the Company’s results of operations).
Segment Information and Foreign and Domestic Operations and Sales
 
For 2022, the Company has two reportable segments. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 280, “Segment Reporting”, we define an operating segment as:

● | a business activity from which we may earn revenue and incur expenses; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker “(CODM”) to make decisions about resources to be allocated and assess its performance; and 
● | for which discrete financial information is available. 

 
TREATMENT SEGMENT reporting includes:
 

- | nuclear, low-level radioactive, mixed (waste containing both hazardous and low-level radioactive waste), hazardous and non-hazardous waste treatment, processing and disposal services primarily through four uniquely licensed (Nuclear Regulatory Commission or state equivalent) and permitted (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) or state equivalent) treatment and storage facilities as follow: Perma-Fix of Florida, Inc. (“PFF”), Diversified Scientific Services, Inc., (“DSSI”), Perma-Fix Northwest Richland, Inc. (“PFNWR”) and Oak Ridge Environmental Waste Operations Center (“EWOC”); and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During March 2022, we signed a joint venture term sheet addressing plans to partner with Springfields Fuels Limited (“SFL”), an affiliate of Westinghouse Electric Company LLC, to develop and manage a nuclear waste-materials treatment facility (the “Facility”) in the United Kingdom. The Facility is for the purpose of expanding the partners’ waste treatment capabilities for the European nuclear market. It is expected that upon finalization of a partnership agreement, SFL will have an ownership interest of fifty-five (55) percent and our interest will be forty-five (45) percent. The finalization, form and capitalization of this unpopulated partnership is subject to numerous conditions, including but not limited to, winning a certain contract, completion and execution of a definitive agreement and facility design, granting of required regulatory, lender or permitting approvals and updated cost and profitability analysis based on current and forecast future economic conditions. Upon finalization of this venture, we will be required to make an investment in this venture. The amount of our investment, the period of which it is to be made and the method of funding are to be determined.
 
Seasonal Factors of our Business
 
Our operations are generally subject to seasonal factors. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to our Business and Operations – Our operations are subject to seasonal factors, which causes our revenues to fluctuate” for a discussion of our seasonal factors.
 
Permits and Licenses
 
Waste management service companies are subject to extensive, evolving and increasingly stringent federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. Such federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations govern our activities regarding the treatment, storage, processing, disposal and transportation of hazardous, non-hazardous and radioactive wastes, and require us to obtain and maintain permits, licenses and/or approvals in order to conduct our waste activities. We are dependent on our permits and licenses discussed below in order to operate our businesses. Failure to obtain and maintain our permits or approvals would have a material adverse effect on us, our operations, and financial condition. The permits and licenses have terms ranging from one to ten years, and provided that we maintain a reasonable level of compliance, renew with minimal effort, and cost. We believe that these permit and license requirements represent a potential barrier to entry for possible competitors.
 
PFF, located in Gainesville, Florida, operates its hazardous, mixed and low-level radioactive waste activities under a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) Part B permit, Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) authorization, Restricted RX Drug Distributor-Destruction license, biomedical, and a radioactive materials license issued by the State of Florida.
 
DSSI, located in Kingston, Tennessee, conducts mixed and low-level radioactive waste storage and treatment activities under RCRA Part B permits and a radioactive materials license issued by the State of Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, Division of radiological health. Co-regulated TSCA Polychlorinated Biphenyl (“PCB”) wastes are also managed for PCB destruction under EPA Approval.
 
PFNWR, located in Richland, Washington, operates a low-level radioactive waste processing facility as well as a mixed waste processing facility. Radioactive material processing is authorized under radioactive materials licenses issued by the State of Washington and mixed waste processing is additionally authorized under a RCRA Part B permit with TSCA authorization issued jointly by the State of Washington and the EPA.
 
EWOC, located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, operates a low-level radioactive waste material processing facility. Radioactive material processing is authorized under radioactive material licenses issued by the State of Tennessee Department of Environmental and Conservation, Division of radiological health.
 
The combination of RCRA Part B hazardous waste permits, TSCA authorizations, and radioactive material licenses held by the Company and its subsidiaries comprising our Treatment Segment is very difficult to obtain for a single facility and make this Segment unique.
 
We believe that the permitting and licensing requirements, and the cost to obtain such permits, are barriers to the entry of hazardous waste and radioactive and mixed waste activities as presently operated by our waste treatment subsidiaries. If the permit requirements for hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal (“TSD”) activities and/or the licensing requirements for the handling of low-level radioactive matters are eliminated or if such licenses or permits were made less rigorous to obtain, we believe such would allow companies to enter into these markets and provide greater competition.

Number of Employees
 
At December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 296 employees, of whom 287 are full-time employees and 9 are part-time/temporary employees. None of our employees are unionized.
 
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)
 
During 2022, we continued to improve our ESG performance. Our ESG subcommittee under our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee continues to provide guidance on ESG management. Our executive team is responsible for the development of a strategic roadmap for ESG efforts with support from management from key functional areas. The key areas of focus under our ESG initiatives continue to be health and safety, environmental performance, DEI (diversity, equality and inclusion), talent retention and development, corporate governance and climate-forward service development that support our customers’ transition to low carbon economy. Our executive team is involved in policy planning and coordination of corporate-wide ESG efforts. See our website at https://www.perma-fix.com/esg.aspx for some highlights of our ESG initiatives as well as our policies under our ESG as we continue to improve our ESG initiatives. The information on our website is not part of, or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. 
Dependence Upon a Single or Few Customers
 
Our Treatment and Services Segments have significant relationships with the U.S. governmental authorities. Our Services Segment also had significant relationships with the Canadian government authorities. A significant amount of our revenues from our Treatment and Services Segments are generated indirectly as subcontractors for others who are prime contractors to government authorities, particularly the DOE and DOD, or directly as the prime contractor to government authorities. The contracts that we are a party to with others as subcontractors to the U.S federal government or directly with the U.S federal government generally provide that the government may terminate the contract at any time for convenience at the government’s option. The contracts/task order agreements (“TOA”) that we are a party to with Canadian governmental authorities also generally provide that the government authorities may terminate the contracts/task order agreements at any time for any reason for convenience. Project work under TOAs with Canadian government authority has substantially been completed. A significant account receivable due to our Perma-Fix Canada, Inc. (“PF Canada”) is subject to continuing negotiations. See “Known Trends and Uncertainties – Perma-Fix Canada, Inc. (“PF Canada”)” in Part II – Item 7 – “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional discussion as to a terminated Canadian TOA. Our inability to continue under existing contracts that we have with U.S government authorities (directly or indirectly as a subcontractor) or significant reductions in the level of governmental funding in any given year could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition.
 
We performed services relating to waste generated by government clients (domestic and foreign (primarily Canadian)), either indirectly for others as a subcontractor to government entities or directly as a prime contractor to government entities, representing approximately $60,030,000, or 85.0%, of our total revenue during 2022, as compared to $60,812,000, or 84.2%, of our total revenue during 2021.
 
Our revenues are project/event based where the completion of one contract with a specific customer may be replaced by another contract with a different customer from year to year.

Competitive Conditions
 
The Treatment Segment’s largest competitor is EnergySolutions which operates treatment facilities in Oak Ridge, TN and Erwin, TN and treatment/disposal facilities for low level radioactive waste in Clive, UT and Barnwell, SC. Waste Control Specialists, which has licensed treatment/disposal capabilities for low level radioactive waste in Andrews, TX, is also a competitor in the treatment market with increasing market share. These two competitors also provide us with options for disposal of our treated nuclear waste. The Treatment Segment treats and disposes of DOE generated waste largely at DOE owned sites. Our Treatment Segment currently solicits business primarily on a North America basis with both government and commercial clients; however, we continue to focus on emerging international markets for additional work.
 
Our Services Segment is engaged in highly competitive businesses in which a number of our government contracts and some of our commercial contracts are awarded through competitive bidding processes. The extent of such competition varies according to the industries and markets in which our customers operate as well as the geographic areas in which we operate. The degree and type of competition we face is also often influenced by the project specification being bid on and the different specialty skill sets of each bidder for which our Services Segment competes, especially projects subject to the governmental bid process. We also have the ability to prime federal government small business procurements (small business set asides). Based on past experience, we believe that large businesses are more willing to team with small businesses in order to be part of these often-substantial procurements. There are a number of qualified small businesses in our market that will provide intense competition that may provide a challenge to our ability to maintain strong growth rates and acceptable profit margins. For international business there are additional competitors, many from within the country the work is to be performed, making winning work in foreign countries more challenging. If our Services Segment is unable to meet these competitive challenges, it could lose market share and experience an overall reduction in its profits.
 
Certain Environmental Expenditures and Potential Environmental Liabilities
 
Environmental Liabilities
 
We have three remediation projects, which are currently in progress relating to our Perma-Fix of Dayton, Inc. (“PFD”), Perma-Fix of Memphis, Inc. (“PFM”), and Perma-Fix South Georgia, Inc. (“PFSG”) subsidiaries, which are all included within our discontinued operations. These remediation projects principally entail the removal/remediation of contaminated soil and, in most cases, the remediation of surrounding ground water. These remediation activities are closely reviewed and monitored by the applicable state regulators.
 
At December 31, 2022, we had total accrued environmental remediation liabilities of $861,000, a decrease of $15,000 from the December 31, 2021 balance of $876,000. The decrease represents payments for remediation projects. At December 31, 2022, $112,000 of the total accrued environmental liabilities was recorded as current.
 
The nature of our business exposes us to significant cost to comply with governmental environmental laws, rules and regulations and risk of liability for damages. Such potential liability could involve, for example, claims for cleanup costs, personal injury or damage to the environment in cases where we are held responsible for the release of hazardous materials; claims of employees, customers or third parties for personal injury or property damage occurring in the course of our operations; and claims alleging negligence or professional errors or omissions in the planning or performance of our services. In addition, we could be deemed a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for the costs of required cleanup of properties, which may be contaminated by hazardous substances generated or transported by us to a site we selected, including properties owned or leased by us. We could also be subject to fines and civil penalties in connection with violations of regulatory requirements.
 
R&D
 
Innovation and technical know-how by our operations is very important to the success of our business. Our goal is to discover, develop and bring to market innovative ways to process waste that address unmet environmental needs. We conduct research internally, and also through collaborations with other third parties. The majority of our research activities are performed as we receive new and unique waste to treat. Our competitors also devote resources to R&D and many such competitors have greater resources at their disposal than we do. R&D totaled $336,000 and $746,000 for 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Governmental Regulation
 
Environmental companies, such as us, and their customers are subject to extensive and evolving environmental laws and regulations by a number of federal, state and local environmental, safety and health agencies, the principal of which being the EPA. These laws and regulations largely contribute to the demand for our services. Although our customers remain responsible by law for their environmental problems, we must also comply with the requirements of those laws applicable to our services. We cannot predict the extent to which our operations may be affected by future enforcement policies as applied to existing laws or by the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations. Moreover, any predictions regarding possible liability are further complicated by the fact that under current environmental laws we could be jointly and severally liable for certain activities of third parties over whom we have little or no control. Although we believe that we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to fines, penalties or other liabilities or could be adversely affected by existing or subsequently enacted laws or regulations. The principal environmental laws affecting our customers and us are briefly discussed below.
 
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (“RCRA”)
 
RCRA and its associated regulations establish a strict and comprehensive permitting and regulatory program applicable to companies, such as us, that treat, store or dispose of hazardous waste. The EPA has promulgated regulations under RCRA for new and existing treatment, storage and disposal facilities including incinerators, storage and treatment tanks, storage containers, storage and treatment surface impoundments, waste piles and landfills. Every facility that treats, stores or disposes of hazardous waste must obtain a RCRA permit or must obtain interim status from the EPA, or a state agency, which has been authorized by the EPA to administer its program, and must comply with certain operating, financial responsibility and closure requirements.
 
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA,” also referred to as the “Superfund Act”)
 
CERCLA governs the cleanup of sites at which hazardous substances are located or at which hazardous substances have been released or are threatened to be released into the environment. CERCLA authorizes the EPA to compel responsible parties to clean up sites and provides for punitive damages for noncompliance. CERCLA imposes joint and several liabilities for the costs of clean up and damages to natural resources.
 
Health and Safety Regulations
 
The operation of our environmental activities is subject to the requirements of the OSHA and comparable state laws. Regulations promulgated under OSHA by the Department of Labor require employers of persons in the transportation and environmental industries, including independent contractors, to implement hazard communications, work practices and personnel protection programs in order to protect employees from equipment safety hazards and exposure to hazardous chemicals.
Atomic Energy Act
 
The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 governs the safe handling and use of Source, Special Nuclear and Byproduct materials in the U.S. and its territories. This act authorized the Atomic Energy Commission (now the Nuclear Regulatory Commission “USNRC”) to enter into “Agreements with states to carry out those regulatory functions in those respective states except for Nuclear Power Plants and federal facilities like the VA hospitals and the DOE operations.” The State of Florida Department of Health (with the USNRC oversight), Office of Radiation Control, regulates the licensing and radiological program of the PFF facility; the State of Tennessee (with the USNRC oversight), Tennessee Division of Radiological Health, regulates licensing and the radiological program of the DSSI facility and the EWOC facility; and the State of Washington (with the USNRC oversight) Department of Health, regulates licensing and the radiological operations of the PFNWR facility.
Other Laws
 
Our activities are subject to other federal environmental protection and similar laws, including, without limitation, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act and the TSCA. Many states have also adopted laws for the protection of the environment which may affect us, including laws governing the generation, handling, transportation and disposition of hazardous substances and laws governing the investigation and cleanup of, and liability for, contaminated sites. Some of these state provisions are broader and more stringent than existing federal law and regulations. Our failure to conform our services to the requirements of any of these other applicable federal or state laws could subject us to substantial liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on us, our operations and financial condition. In addition to various federal, state and local environmental regulations, our hazardous waste transportation activities are regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Interstate Commerce Commission and transportation regulatory bodies in the states in which we operate. We cannot predict the extent to which we may be affected by any law or rule that may be enacted or enforced in the future, or any new or different interpretations of existing laws or rules.
