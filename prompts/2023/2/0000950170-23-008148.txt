 Item 1. Business.
We are a preclinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing innovative precision therapeutics for debilitating and rare diseases.
From our inception, we have been focused on novel therapeutic approaches to improve the lives of patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and other degenerative diseases. Our predecessor company, Cortexyme, Inc. (“Cortexyme”) was initially founded on the seminal discovery of the presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, or P. gingivalis, and its secreted toxic virulence factor proteases, called gingipains, in the relevant brain areas of both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease patients. The acquisition of Novosteo, Inc. in 2022, and the addition of new executive management has allowed us to strategically shift focus and prioritize the internal development of our innovative bone-targeting drug platform and lead compound NOV004 for development for rare skeletal diseases, bone fractures, and injury. Following the Acquisition, we changed our corporate name to Quince Therapeutics, Inc.
 On January 27, 2023, we sold our legacy small molecule protease inhibitor portfolio, including COR588, COR388, COR852, and COR803, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement with Lighthouse Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 On January 30, 2023, we provided an update on our development pipeline and business outlook for 2023. We intend to prioritize capital resources toward the expansion of our development pipeline through opportunistic in-licensing and acquisition of clinical-stage assets targeting debilitating and rare diseases. We plan to partner or out-license to support further development of our bone-targeting drug platform and precision bone growth molecule NOV004 designed for accelerated fracture repair in patients with bone fractures and osteogenesis imperfecta.
 2022 and 2023 Key Events
 •In January 2022, we received a letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) placing a full clinical hold on atuzaginstat’s (COR388). In response, we implemented a cost reduction program to rationalize operations and to allow continued support for the continuing business operations.
 •In January 2022, Casey Lynch resigned as chairperson of the board and as president and Chief Executive Officer and Steve Dominy resigned as a director on the Board and as the Chief Scientific Officer. 
 •In May 2022, we completed the acquisition of Novosteo, Inc. ("Novosteo"), a privately-held biotech company focused on targeted therapeutics to treat rare skeletal diseases, bone cancer and injury.
 •In conjunction with the acquisition of Novosteo, we appointed Dirk Thye, M.D. as Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Karen Smith, M.D., Ph.D. as Chief Medical Officer and Brendan Hannah as Chief Business Officer.
 •In January 2023, we sold our legacy small molecule protease inhibitor portfolio, including COR588, COR388, COR852, and COR803, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement with Lighthouse Pharmaceuticals, Inc., an entity co-founded by Casey Lynch, former Chief Executive Officer of our predecessor company, Cortexyme, Inc.
Drug Candidate Portfolio
 NOV004
 NOV004 was discovered using our broad drug-targeting platform designed to precisely deliver small molecules, peptides, or large molecules directly to the site of bone fracture and disease to promote more rapid healing. NOV004 is a systemically administered bone anabolic peptide engineered to target and concentrate at bone fracture sites. By improving fracture site accumulation and retention, NOV004 stimulates a robust healing response in preclinical studies. Notable preclinical observations include:
 •In a fracture induction study in healthy mice, at 3 weeks post femur fracture, NOV004 treated mice could withstand greater than 1.5 times the force in a four-point bend test compared to both the vehicle controls and the non-targeted bone anabolic peptide at the same point in time.
 •Similar improvements in fracture repair have been observed in mouse bone fracture models with comorbidities such as osteoporosis, diabetes, or osteogenesis imperfecta – a rare genetic bone disease that manifests in skeletal deformities and high fracture rates.


•Other improvements in fracture repair were observed by tracking animal’s voluntary movements. As early as 12 days post fracture, mice treated with NOV004 moved significantly faster, as measured by cm/s travelled, than either the mice treated with vehicle or ibuprofen (8.1 cm/s vs 6.0 cm/s and 5.5cm/s respectively). In addition, by day 28, both distances traveled (cm) and time spent (seconds) were also significantly higher in NOV004 treated mice compared to vehicle or ibuprofen controls.
 
Our discovery pipeline is potentially applicable across multiple skeletal therapeutic indications to address underserved therapeutic areas with major, unmet medical needs, including osteogenesis imperfecta, fractures, spinal fusion, and other severe bone diseases. We are currently exploring partnership and out-licensing opportunities to support the future development of NOV004.
 
Legacy Small Molecule Protease Inhibitor Portfolio
 
Atuzaginstat (COR388)

Atuzaginstat (COR388) is a novel, orally-administered, small molecule, bacterial protease inhibitor targeting gingipains produced by the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis (P gingivalis). This pathogen has been associated with several diseases in humans including Alzheimer’s disease, periodontal disease and certain head and neck cancers. On October 26, 2021, we announced top-line results from our global Phase 2/3 clinical trial of atuzaginstat (COR388), called the GAIN (GingipAIN Inhibitor for Treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease) trial, in mild to moderate Alzheimer’s patients. The 643-participant study did not meet statistical significance on its co-primary cognitive and functional endpoints as measured by ADAS-Cog11 and ADCS- ADL at end of the treatment period in the overall cohort.
 
On January 25, 2022, we received a letter from the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) Division of Neurology 1 placing a full clinical hold on the IND application for atuzaginstat (COR388). We sold this compound to Lighthouse Pharmaceutical, Inc., see "Sale of legacy portfolio" section below.

COR588
 
COR588 is a second-generation brain penetrant lysine gingipain inhibitor which has completed IND-enabling studies. We began a Phase 1 SAD/MAD trial of COR588 in a cohort of healthy participants in Australia in August 2021. In March 2022, we announced results from the SAD portion of the Phase 1 trial and in July 2022 we announced results from the MAD portion of the Phase 1 trial. Preliminary results indicate COR588 was well-tolerated across all cohorts in the dose range from 25 mg to 200 mg with no serious adverse events. No clinically significant findings were observed on other safety measures, including vital signs, laboratory findings, telemetry, or ECGs. We sold this compound to Lighthouse Pharmaceutical, Inc., see "Sale of legacy portfolio" section below.

COR803
 
COR803 for coronavirus is a novel patent-pending small molecule 3CL pro inhibitor discovered and developed by us based on our expertise in cysteine protease inhibition. We sold this compound to Lighthouse Pharmaceutical, Inc., see "Sale of legacy portfolio" section below.

Business Acquisition
 On May 19, 2022, we acquired all of the equity voting interests and completed the acquisition of Novosteo (the “Acquisition”) pursuant to a certain Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization dated as of May 9, 2022 (the “Merger Agreement”). To effect this transaction, a combination of transactions was executed with the intention of being treated as integrated steps in a single transaction resulting in Novosteo being a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
In conjunction with the Acquisition, we appointed Novosteo executives Dirk Thye, M.D. as Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Karen Smith, M.D., Ph.D. as Chief Medical Officer and Brendan Hannah as Chief Business Officer. We also appointed Dr. Thye and Philip S. Low, Ph.D. to our Board of Directors as Class II and Class I directors, respectively.
 Effective August 1, 2022, we changed our corporate name from Cortexyme, Inc. to Quince Therapeutics, Inc. and our ticker symbol from "CRTX" to "QNCX".
 Sale of Legacy Portfolio
On January 27, 2023, we sold our legacy small molecule protease inhibitor portfolio, including COR588, COR388, COR852, and COR803 (the “Transaction”), pursuant to an asset purchase agreement with Lighthouse Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “Purchaser”).


Upon the consummation of the Transaction, we received shares of common stock of Purchaser (“Common Stock”) equal to seven and a half percent (7.5%) of the currently issued and outstanding Common Stock. The issuance is governed by a Stock Issuance Agreement entered into by us and Purchaser on January 27, 2023 (the “Stock Agreement”). The Stock Agreement contains certain anti-dilution rights and certain transfer restrictions on the Common Stock, including a right of first offer in favor of Purchaser and certain restrictions with respect to non-U.S. persons.
 Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we are eligible to receive milestone payments up to $150 million on a product by product basis for the achievement of certain regulatory approvals and global net sales thresholds. Additionally, we are eligible to receive certain sales-based royalty payments on a product by product basis, ranging from high single-digit to mid-teens of annual net sales related to the two existing clinical stage programs, and low single-digit royalties for the preclinical programs, and certain sublicense income on a product by product basis, either in addition to milestone payments and royalties prior to Phase 2 initiation for COR588 or COR388, or in lieu of milestones payments and royalties after initiation of Phase 2 for COR588 or COR388 or for the preclinical programs.
 We and the Purchaser have made certain covenants in the Purchase Agreement with respect to the transfer of the assets, including requisite filings to be made with regulatory authorities, and the milestone, royalty and sublicense payments and have agreed to indemnify each other for any breaches of such party’s covenants, assumed liabilities (in the case of Purchaser) and retained liabilities, subject to certain customary survival periods and mitigation requirements. In addition, Purchaser granted to us an exclusive option until June 30, 2023 to obtain worldwide, royalty-free, fully-paid up, irrevocable and perpetual right and license under the transferred intellectual property related to COR388 to research, develop, manufacture, use, commercialize and otherwise exploit COR388 in any animal health indication.
 Corporate Restructuring
 In January 2023, we made the decision to discontinue internal development of NOV004 and to pursue out-licensing opportunities. As a result, we approved the cost reduction program (the “Plan”) to align operations with the changes in corporate strategy. Under the Plan, we are reducing headcount by approximately 47% through a reduction in our workforce. The reduction in force began in February 2023 and is expected to be completed by April 2023. As a result, we expect to realize estimated annualized operating expense savings of approximately $10 million in the year ending December 31, 2023 (excluding share-based compensation and any one-time costs related to strategic actions).
 
In connection with the Plan, we estimate that we will incur expenses of approximately $0.6 million to $0.8 million, substantially all of which will be cash expenditures and other costs relating to the Plan through August 2023. We may incur other charges, including contract termination costs, retirement of fixed assets and facility-related costs and will record these expenses in the appropriate period as they are determined. These estimates are subject to a number of assumptions, and actual results may differ. we may also incur additional costs not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of, or that are associated with, the Plan.
Business Update Regarding COVID-19
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is affecting the world economy and financial markets. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets.
 
At this time the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has not resulted in changes to our previously stated analysis timelines and milestones. We have not experienced significant hinderances to our operations or material negative financial impacts as compared to prior periods. We continue to assess the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic, which take into account applicable public health authority and local government guidelines and are designed to ensure community and employee safety.

The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to evolve and we may have to resume a more restrictive remote work model or close again certain of our offices, whether as a result of spikes or surges in COVID-19 infection or hospitalization rates or public authority mandates. Also, as long as the pandemic continues, our employees may be exposed to health risks. We will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation and its impact on our business and operations.
 For additional information on the various risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, please read Item 1A. Risk Factors included in this report.


Manufacturing
 We do not currently own or operate facilities for manufacturing, storing, distributing or testing our drug candidates. We rely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to manufacture and supply our preclinical and clinical materials to be used during the development of our drug candidate.
 
We are in the process of halting the manufacturing of the production of NOV004 and terminating our contracts with the manufacturing vendor. We are currently obligated to our vendors for certain drug substance and drug product development work. We do not expect to incur significant additional costs to terminate the manufacturing activities above our current contractual obligations.

Commercialization Plan
 We do not currently have any approved drugs. Therefore, we have no sales, marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities and have no experience as a company in marketing drugs.
 When and if any of our drug candidates are approaching commercialization, we intend to develop a commercialization infrastructure for those drug candidates in the United States and potentially in certain other key markets. We may also rely on partnerships to provide commercialization infrastructure, including sales and marketing and commercial distribution.
 Competition
 We face competition from a number of different sources, including large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. We believe that the key competitive factors affecting the success of any drug candidates will include efficacy, safety profile, method of administration, cost, level of promotional activity and intellectual property protection.
There are many bone building and osteoporosis drugs currently in development and available in the United States include anti-resorptive agents, anabolic agents, and an agent that has both anabolic and anti-resorptive characteristics. Anti-resorptive agents including bisphosphonates, hormone therapy, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), and Amgen's Prolia (denosumab), are the most common treatments for osteoporosis. Teriparatide, marketed by Lilly under the name Forteo/Forsteo (outside the U.S.) and abaloparatide, marketed by Radius Health under the name Tymlos are both anabolic drugs targeting the PTH receptor approved in the United States for the treatment of osteoporosis. We are aware of companies pursuing development in the United States of teriparatide through various regulatory pathways, including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd., and APOTEX. We believe other companies may be in earlier stages of development of a generic version of teriparatide. Romosozumab, an anti-sclerostin monoclonal antibody for the treatment of osteoporosis, is marketed by Amgen and UCB under the name Evenity, following regulatory approval in the US, Europe and Japan.
 There are several therapies in development for osteogenesis imperfecta including setrusumab, an anti-sclerostin monoclonal antibody, in development by Ultragenyx and Mereo BioPharma; SAR439459, and fresolimumab, both anti-TGF-beta monoclonal antibodies, in development by Sanofi; and romosozumab, in development by Amgen.
 These competitors may influence our ability to successfully out-license NOV004 and the terms thereof.
 Intellectual Property
 The divesture of the legacy protease inhibitor compounds to Lighthouse Pharmaceuticals, Inc. included the associated patents. However, we maintain certain rights, including;
•Potential for Quince to receive up to $150 million in regulatory and commercial milestones payments on a product-by-product basis, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement,
 •Potential tiered royalty rates on a product-by-product basis ranging from high single-digit to mid-teens of annual net sales related to the two existing clinical stage programs, and low single-digit royalties for the preclinical programs, subject to the terms and conditions in the Purchase Agreement.
 We actively protect our commercially important proprietary technology by, among other methods, obtaining, maintaining, and defending our patent rights. Issued patents can provide protection for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In general, patents issued for applications filed in the United States can provide exclusionary rights for 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, the term of an issued U.S. patent that covers or claims an FDA approved product can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, which is

called patent term extension. The period of patent term extension in the United States cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the extension period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The term of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with the laws of the foreign jurisdiction, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. Some countries also provide mechanisms to recapture a portion of the patent term lost during regulatory review, similar to patent term extension in the United States. The amount of patent term that can be recaptured depends on the laws of the relevant jurisdictions.
 We have filed or licensed numerous patent applications covering NOV004 in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States. We pursue patent protection for all inventions and improvements throughout development, including, when possible, compositions of matter, methods of use, dosage regimens, formulations, and manufacturing processes.
 We have licensed exclusive rights in numerous patents and patent applications relating to NOV004. Issued patents covering the compound NOV004 as a composition of matter and therapeutic methods of using NOV004 have been obtained in the United States and Russia and are estimated to expire 2037, not including any available patent term adjustments or extensions. We have also exclusively licensed additional patent applications relating to NOV004 and its method of use, which when issued, are estimated to expire between 2037 and 2041, not including any available patent term adjustments or extensions. Novosteo LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, owns an additional patent application relating to therapeutic methods of using NOV004, which, when issued, is estimated to expire in 2042, not including any available patent term adjustments or extensions.
 As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our drug candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, our pending patent applications, and any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties may not result in the issuance of patents. We cannot guarantee that our owned pending patent application, or any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties, will result in the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the scope of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our programs and drug candidates. Any issued patents that we may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. For example, we cannot be certain of the priority rights of inventions covered by pending third-party patent applications. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States or other jurisdictions that also claim technology or therapeutics to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings, post-grant review, reissue, or reexamination in the USPTO and equivalent foreign courts, which could result in substantial costs to us even if the eventual outcome, which is highly unpredictable, is favorable to us. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our drug candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby limiting any protection such patent would afford the respective product and any competitive advantage such patent may provide. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property.”
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application in the United States. In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our drug candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those drug candidates. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property.”
 In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trademark registration, trade secrets, know how, other proprietary information and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets and we cannot guarantee, however, that these agreements will afford us adequate

protection of our intellectual property and proprietary information rights. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Our agreements with employees also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee in the course of employment with us or from the employee’s use of our confidential information are our exclusive property. However, such confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. Additionally, some of our trade secrets and know-how for which we decide to not pursue additional patent protection may, over time, be disseminated within the industry through independent development and public presentations describing the methodology. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property.”
 The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our drugs or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or our failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights required to develop or commercialize our future drug candidates may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property.”
 Regulatory Matters
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing, sampling and export and import of pharmaceutical products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
U.S. Drug Development
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties.
 An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following:
 •completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
 •submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin;
 •approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each proposed indication;
 •preparation and submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA, requesting marketing for one or more proposed indications;
 •review by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
 •satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;


•satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
 •payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and
 •compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
 Preclinical Studies
 Before an applicant begins testing a compound with potential therapeutic value in humans, the drug candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 The IND and IRB Processes
 The authorization for an IND must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any new drug that is not the subject of an approved NDA. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin.
 Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed.
 A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all IND requirements must be met unless waived. When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain FDA regulatory requirements in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, the FDA has promulgated regulations governing the acceptance of foreign clinical studies not conducted under an IND, establishing that such studies will be accepted as support for an IND or application for marketing approval if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and informed consent from subjects, and the FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an on-site inspection if the FDA deems such inspection necessary. The GCP requirements encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies. If a marketing application is based solely on foreign clinical data, the FDA requires that the foreign data be applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice; the studies must have been performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence; and the FDA must be able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means, if the FDA deems such an inspection to be necessary.
 In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Suspension or termination of

development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
 Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 Human Clinical Studies in Support of an NDA
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
 •Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or, in certain indications such as cancer, patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage.
 •Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
 •Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
 •Phase 4: Post-approval studies, which are conducted following initial approval, are typically conducted to gain additional experience and data from treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.
 The clinical drug development phases described above are general guidelines. The phases are not clearly delineated from each other in every regard, and it is common practice to separate (e.g., Phase 1a and 1b trials) or combine (e.g., a Phase 2/3 trial) phases, which is accepted by the FDA and other global regulatory agencies.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 Submission of an NDA to the FDA
 Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to an application user fee, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual program fees.


The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days of its receipt and informs the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Most such applications are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the filing date, and most applications for “priority review” products are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. The review process and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
 Before approving a NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (such as active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
 In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. A REMS uses risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. A REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product.
 The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 The FDA’s Decision on an NDA
 On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.


In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 •restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 •safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warning or other safety information about the product;
 •fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided, and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Even if our drug candidates are approved, sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, such products. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product is separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product if coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, drug candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our drug candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party reimbursement and coverage may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.


Within the United States, if we obtain appropriate approval in the future to market any of our drug product candidates, those products could potentially be covered by various government health benefit programs as well as purchased by government agencies. The participation in such programs or the sale of products to such agencies is subject to regulation.
 The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent the generation of revenue, attainment of profitability, or commercialization of products. In addition, it is possible that there will be further legislation or regulation that could harm the business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for our drug candidates will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our drug candidates or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts.
 In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies (so called health technology assessment, or HTA) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states), can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved in those countries.
 Healthcare Law and Regulation
 Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, reporting of payments to physicians, certain other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals and patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain our business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:
 •the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
 •the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.


•the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
 •HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH), which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
 •the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians (defined to include to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other healthcare providers (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
 •analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
 Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
Failure to comply with the aforementioned laws can result in the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative sanctions, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, imprisonment, and integrity oversight and reporting obligations.
 Healthcare Reform
 A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States.
 In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for drug products under government healthcare programs.
Since its enactment, there have been executive, legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. In addition, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and through a newly established manufacturer discount program. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and additional healthcare reform measures will impact the ACA and our business. Other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of our existing products that we successfully commercialize or to successfully commercialize our drug candidates, if approved.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2031, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid

drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. In addition, Congress is considering additional health reform measures.
 In addition to the ACA, there will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and third-party payors to keep healthcare costs down while expanding individual healthcare benefits. For example, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent presidential executive orders, Congressional inquiries, and proposed federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. Further, the IRA will, among other things (i) allow HHS to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare, and subject drug manufacturers to civil monetary penalties and a potential excise tax by offering a price that is not equal to or less than the “negotiated fair price” under the law and (ii) impose rebates with respect to certain drugs and biologics covered under Medicare Part B or Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. It is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated but is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Further, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to submit a report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. It is unclear whether these or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent the generation of revenue, attainment of profitability, or commercialization of products. In addition, it is possible that there will be further legislation or regulation that could harm the business, financial condition and results of operations.
