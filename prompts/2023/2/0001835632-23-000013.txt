Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas
We have determined that we operate in one reportable segment: the design, development and sale of integrated circuits. For information regarding our revenue by geographic area, and property and equipment by geographic area, please see “Note 15 – Segment and Geographic Information” in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks associated with our international operations.
Customers, Sales and Marketing 
Our target customers are original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and original design manufacturers, both of which design and manufacture end market devices. We seek to strategically align our sales force along key customer lines in order to offer fully integrated platforms to our customers. In this way, we believe we can more effectively offer a broader set of content into our key customers’ end products, without having multiple product groups separately engage the same customer. We seek to complement and support our direct sales force with manufacturers’ representatives for our products in North America and Europe. In addition, we have contracted with distributors who support our sales and marketing activities in the United States, Europe and Asia. We also use third-party logistics providers who maintain warehouses in close proximity to our customers’ facilities. We expect that a significant percentage of our sales will continue to come from direct sales to key customers.
We use field application engineers to provide technical support and assistance to existing and potential customers in designing, testing and qualifying systems designs that incorporate our products. Our marketing team works in conjunction with our field sales and application engineering force, and is organized around our product groups.

During fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, there was no net revenue attributable to a customer, other than one distributor, whose revenues as a percentage of net revenue was 10% or greater of total net revenues. Net revenue attributable to significant distributors whose revenues as a percentage of net revenue was 10% or greater of total net revenues is presented in the following table:

 | Year Ended 
 | January 28,2023 | | January 29,2022 | | January 30,2021
Distributor: | | | | | 
Distributor A | 20 | % | | 15 | % | 13 | %

Net revenue attributable to Distributor A increased due to the change of four large module makers from direct to distribution accounts to align with our support business model in Asia.
Inventory and Working Capital
We typically place firm orders with our suppliers up to 52 weeks prior to the anticipated delivery date and typically prior to an order for the product. Starting in fiscal 2022 and through the first half of fiscal 2023, in response to a large increase in demand from our customers for our products in a majority of our end markets as they continued to invest in data infrastructure, our operations team continued to increase production with our global supply chain partners to alleviate supply constraints. However, with the start of a broad inventory correction in the semiconductor industry, supply constraints have now mostly resolved. To secure capacity over the long term, we have entered into and expect to continue to enter into capacity reservation arrangements with certain foundries and partners for substrates. Our products typically have long multi-year lifecycles and we often maintain substantial inventories because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules.
Research and Development
We believe that our future success depends on our ability to introduce improvements to our existing products and to develop new products that deliver cost-effective solutions for both existing and new markets. Our research and development efforts are directed largely to the development of high-performance analog, mixed-signal, digital signal processing and embedded microprocessor integrated circuits with the smallest die size and lowest power. We devote a significant portion of our resources to expanding our product portfolio based on a broad intellectual property portfolio with designs that are intended to enable high-performance, reliable communications over a variety of physical transmission media. We are also focused on incorporating functions currently provided by stand-alone integrated circuits into our integrated platform solutions to reduce our customers’ overall system costs.
We have assembled a core team of engineers who have experience in the areas of complementary metal oxide semiconductor (“CMOS”) technology, digital signal processing, electro-optics, embedded microprocessors, mixed-signal circuit design, silicon photonics, and system-level architectures. We have invested and expect to continue to invest a significant amount in research and development. See our discussion of research and development expenses in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
Manufacturing
Integrated Circuit Fabrication
The vast majority of our integrated circuits are fabricated using widely available CMOS processes, which is intended to provide greater flexibility to engage independent foundries to manufacture integrated circuits at lower costs. By outsourcing manufacturing, we are able to avoid the cost associated with owning and operating our own manufacturing facilities. This is intended to allow us to focus our efforts on the design and marketing of our products. We seek to work closely with our foundry partners to forecast on a monthly basis our manufacturing capacity requirements. We also seek to closely monitor foundry production to help ensure consistent overall quality, reliability and yield levels. Our integrated circuits are currently fabricated in several advanced manufacturing processes. Because more precise manufacturing processes are expected to lead to enhanced performance, smaller silicon chip size and lower power requirements, we continually seek to evaluate the benefits and feasibility of migrating to smaller geometry process technology in order to reduce cost and improve performance.
8 


Assembly and Test
We typically outsource all product packaging and testing requirements for our products in production to several assembly and test subcontractors primarily located in Taiwan, Canada, Korea, Singapore and China.
Governmental Regulations
Import/Export, National Security and Other Regulations Related to International Operations and Ownership
We are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, which may differ among jurisdictions, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to: intellectual property ownership and infringement; tax; import and export requirements; anti-corruption; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; conflict minerals; data privacy requirements; competition; advertising; employment; product regulations; environment, health and safety requirements; and consumer laws. For example, government export regulations apply to the encryption or other features contained in some of our products.
A portion of the business we acquired in our Avera acquisition in fiscal 2021 requires facility security clearances under the National Industrial Security Program. The National Industrial Security Program requires that a corporation maintaining a facility security clearance be effectively insulated from foreign ownership, control or influence (“FOCI”). Because we were organized in Bermuda at the time of the Avera acquisition, we entered into agreements with the U.S. Department of Defense with respect to FOCI mitigation arrangements that relate to our operation of the portion of the Avera business involving facility clearances. These measures and arrangements may materially and adversely affect our operating results due to the increased cost of compliance with these measures. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements, our ability to operate our business may be adversely affected. Now that we are domiciled in the United States, we have requested to be released from some of the above FOCI-related obligations. We can offer no assurance that such a request will be granted in a timely manner or at all.
Primarily as a result of our acquisition of Avera, we are now a party to certain contracts with the U.S. government and its subcontractors. Our contracts with government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration and performance. 
See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on regulatory matters. 
Environmental Management
We are also subject to environmental rules and regulations in multiple jurisdictions, such as the EU Directive on Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS), the EU Regulation, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals SVHC Substances Directive, the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive), China’s regulation on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products, and California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986.
We believe that our products comply with the current Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, the European legislation that restricts the use of a number of substances, including lead, and the Regulation, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals SVHC Substances Directive. In addition, each of our manufacturing subcontractors certifies to us compliance with ISO 14001:2004, the international standard related to environmental management. We are also working to establish a “conflict-free” supply chain, including ethical sourcing of certain minerals for our products.
Intellectual Property 
Our future revenue growth and overall success depend in large part on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, contractual provisions, confidentiality agreements and licenses to protect our intellectual property. As of January 28, 2023, we have over 10,000 issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and other countries, covering various aspects of our technology. The expiration of our patents range from 2023 to 2042, and none of the patents expiring in the near future are expected to be material to our IP portfolio as we are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents. While we believe the duration of our patents generally covers the expected lives of our products, our patents may not collectively or individually cover every feature on innovation in our product. In addition, our efforts may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property from misappropriation or infringement. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks associated with our intellectual property.
9 


We have expended and expect to continue to expend considerable resources in establishing a patent position designed to protect our intellectual property. While our ability to compete is enhanced by our ability to protect our intellectual property, we believe that in view of the rapid pace of technological change, the combination of the technical experience and innovative skills of our employees may be as important to our business as the legal protection of our patents and other proprietary information.
From time to time, we may desire or be required to renew or to obtain licenses from third parties in order to further develop and effectively market commercially viable products or in connection with a pending or future claim or action asserted against us. We cannot be sure that any necessary licenses will be available or will be available on commercially reasonable terms.
The integrated circuit industry is characterized by vigorous pursuit and protection of intellectual property rights, which has resulted in significant and often time consuming and expensive litigation. From time to time, we receive, and may continue to receive in the future, notices that claim we have infringed upon, misappropriated or misused the proprietary rights of other parties.
In addition, we have in the past and may in the future be sued by other parties who claim that we have infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused other intellectual property rights, or who may seek to invalidate one or more of our patents, trademarks, or other rights. Although we defend these claims vigorously, it is possible that we will not prevail in pending or future lawsuits. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and “Note 6 – Commitments and Contingencies” in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the risks associated with patent litigation matters.
Cyber Security and Information Security Risk Oversight
The Company has a Cyber Security Governance Committee composed of executives and subject matter experts who meet no less than quarterly to review the Company’s information security, programs, policies, and projects. The Company’s Internal Audit Group reviews the cyber security governance and controls annually. In addition, at least quarterly the Audit Committee reviews reports on cyber security from the Chief Information Officer, the Chief Information Security Officer and other members of the Company’s management team.
We regularly perform risk assessments relating to cyber security and technology risks. More specifically, an independent third party performs a quarterly penetration test of Marvell’s IT infrastructure. In addition to quarterly penetration testing, at least once a year, we bring in an independent third party security firm to perform additional tests and audits. Risks identified in this process are analyzed to determine the impact on the Company and the likelihood of occurrence. Such risks are continuously monitored. We conduct information security training as part of our ongoing compliance program, and every employee of the Company is required to participate in such training. We install and regularly update anti-malware and endpoint detection and response (EDR software) on all IT-managed systems and workstations to detect and prevent malicious code from impacting our systems.
The Company has not experienced a material security breach in the last three years, and as a result, we have not incurred any net expenses from such a breach. We have not been penalized or paid any amount under an information security breach settlement over the last three years. Further, the Company periodically assesses its insurance coverage and has determined not to purchase cyber related insurance.
Competition 
The markets for our products are intensely competitive, and are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and pricing pressures. Competition has intensified as a result of the increasing demand for higher levels of performance, integration and smaller process geometries. We expect competition to further intensify as current competitors strengthen the depth and breadth of their product offerings, either through in-house development or by acquiring existing technology. In addition, some of our customers have chosen to develop certain semiconductor products internally and this trend may continue to proliferate. We believe that our ability to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving markets for our products depends on multiple factors, including, but not limited to:
•the performance, features, quality and price of our products;
•the development execution, timing and success of enhanced and new product introductions by us, our customers and our competitors;
•the emergence, rate of adoption and acceptance of new industry standards;
•market demand trends;
10 


•competitive tactics;
•our ability to obtain adequate foundry capacity with the appropriate technological capability; and
•the number and nature of our competitors in a given market.
Companies that compete directly with our businesses include, but are not limited to, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.(“AMD”), Astera Labs, Inc., Broadcom Inc.(“Broadcom”), Cisco Systems, Inc.(“Cisco”), Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd, Intel Corporation, MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc., MediaTek Inc., Microchip Technology Inc., Montage Technology, Nvidia Corporation, NXP Semiconductors N.V., Phison Electronics Corporation, Qualcomm Incorporated (“Qualcomm”), Rambus, Inc., Realtek Semiconductor Corporation, Semtech Corporation, Silicon Motion Technology Corporation, and Socionext Inc. We expect increased competition in the future from both emerging and established companies, as well as from alliances among competitors, customers or other third parties, any of which could acquire significant market share. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of competitive risks associated with our business.
We expect that the average unit selling prices of our products will continue to be subject to significant pricing pressures. In order to offset expected declines in the selling prices of our products, we will need to continue to introduce innovative new products and attempt to reduce the cost to design and manufacture our products. To accomplish this, we intend to continue to implement design changes that lower the cost of manufacturing, assembly and testing of our products. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of pricing risks.
Human Capital 
We believe that attracting, retaining and motivating a workforce with the ability to support our leading position in semiconductor innovation is essential to effectively execute our strategy. Accordingly, we believe our success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate the highly skilled talent necessary to scale our business. We believe the people who work here are our greatest resource, and we encourage and empower all individuals employed at Marvell to excel to their greatest potential. We seek to create an environment that fuels collaboration and innovation, inspires our employees to give their best, and enables our business to thrive. We work hard to attract the industry’s best talent, provide opportunities to learn and grow, and create an environment where our employees feel motivated, appreciated and engaged, and have a pathway to building a long-term career at Marvell.
Our Board of Directors (the “Board”) and its committees share oversight of our human capital management strategy. The Nominating and Governance Committee has oversight of our approach to human capital and inclusion and diversity as part of its broader focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”). Marvell annually conducts talent reviews and succession planning and the Board receives updates regularly from senior management on succession planning, management talent assessment, attrition and employee survey results. Our executive management team also reviews our human capital initiatives and our progress on such initiatives. The Audit Committee provides oversight of business risks and ethics and compliance programs, both of which have relevance for human capital- and workplace-related issues. The Executive Compensation Committee provides oversight of our overall compensation philosophy, policies and programs, and their respective alignment with our human capital strategy.
The Company employed 7,448 people as of January 28, 2023. As of January 28, 2023, our global workforce was comprised of approximately: 99.6% full time employees and 0.4% part time employees. Our employees sit across three geographical regions: 48.6% of employees are based in the Americas, 40.4% are in APAC (which includes India) and 11.0% are in EMEA.
At Marvell, we focus on employee retention by seeking to foster an environment where people can learn, develop, and advance their careers with us over the long term. We regularly monitor employee turnover, as given the nature of our business, our success depends upon highly trained personnel with the technical skills necessary to execute on our business objectives. We believe the combination of competitive compensation and career growth and development opportunities help to increase employee tenure and reduce voluntary turnover. Intern and entry level professional new hires are an important part of our overall talent pipeline and strategy, as students and entry level professionals often have knowledge in the latest research and innovations, and we want Marvell to benefit from that knowledge.
11 


Competitive Compensation and Benefits
We believe we provide comprehensive, market-competitive compensation and benefits, including affordable health and wellness coverage, globally and consider them a key priority for attracting and keeping top talent. Each year, we benchmark our compensation and benefits programs against our industry peers to help ensure we maintain competitiveness in each of our markets. We seek to align our executives’ long-term equity compensation with our stockholders’ interests by linking realizable pay with performance.
Culture, Engagement and Development
Marvell’s Core Behaviors lay the foundation of our culture and are centered around four key aspects:
•Act with integrity and treat everyone with respect,
•Innovate to solve customer needs,
•Execute with thoroughness and rigor, and
•Help others achieve their objectives.
Our efforts to attract, develop, engage and retain employees, as well as our efforts to embed inclusion and diversity (“I&D”) across the Company, reinforce these behaviors. Our Core Behaviors also serve as a roadmap to help integrate employees as we grow through hiring and acquisitions.
We seek to take a holistic approach to helping employees feel engaged, connected and supported — from employee and family events, to learning and development, to weekly Company-wide emails from our CEO. One of the ways we measure levels of engagement is through our annual Voice of the Employee Survey. Survey results help us to better understand employee needs and opportunities for improvement, and to develop action plans to address them.
We offer a variety of employee training programs, including management training programs aligned with the level of managers, technical training, mandatory compliance trainings and voluntary professional development opportunities. In addition, we organize a wide range of employee events designed to foster a sense of community at Marvell.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented challenges for all individuals and businesses. Our leadership has continued to engage and support employees through the pandemic in a range of ways, including sending frequent communication and resources, providing a number of four day “recharge weekends,” and surveying employees on the experience of working from home. See the Health and Safety section below for more details.
Inclusion and Diversity
Marvell is committed to creating and fostering an inclusive, diverse and engaging workplace where people feel fulfilled, inspired and motivated to learn and grow both personally and professionally. We value the uniqueness that a diverse global team brings to our company, and we are focused on creating an environment that fully leverages the perspectives and contributions of every individual.
Our Inclusion and Diversity (“I&D”) approach is centered around three key aspects:
•Interconnected across the company: Embedding inclusivity in every function and in everything we do
•Full participation and responsibility: Empowering every employee to do their part toward creating a welcoming and inclusive environment
•Globally aligned and locally relevant: Applying our global strategic framework to specific regional and local site needs
Our efforts focus on four I&D business outcomes:
•Activate and empower leaders
•Create an inclusive best place to work

Health and Safety
We believe everyone deserves a safe workplace that supports their health and wellbeing. To help create this environment, we seek to continue to evolve our programs and resources to support employees’ mental and physical wellbeing.
The COVID-19 pandemic has placed a continued emphasis on health and safety at Marvell, and we took various steps to promote the health, safety and wellness of our employees during the crisis.
While our workplaces are mainly office facilities with limited safety hazards, we recognize the importance of preventing and addressing any risks that may occur. As a company, we work to prevent injury by focusing on ergonomics, employee training, maintenance, hazard reporting mechanisms and developing emergency action plans. We encourage our employees to report unsafe conditions.
Climate Change
Climate change is an important topic for Marvell. We recognize that climate change may pose potential risks and may create potential opportunities to our organization and are taking steps to further identify and assess the nature and magnitude of these risks and opportunities. As such, Marvell is working to develop plans to mitigate and manage any potential material climate change risks and to benefit from any potential climate change opportunities.
Management is responsible for formulating and executing our climate strategy. Marvell also runs an executive-level ESG Committee to provide senior leadership and strategic guidance on ESG, as well as ESG Working Groups who are responsible for gathering data, setting strategy and goals, and supporting disclosure efforts on material ESG topics. Marvell’s Chief Operations Officer (the “COO”) is the executive sponsor of the Environment Working Groups and has overall responsibility at the executive level for climate strategy and related issues. The COO is responsible for assessing and leading the management of climate-related risks and opportunities, elevating stakeholder concerns and guiding the implementation of climate-related policies, programs and disclosures. The COO is also a member of the executive-level ESG Committee, and, in that capacity, is responsible for elevating climate topics to Marvell’s senior leadership and, ultimately, to the Board’s Nominating and Governance and Audit Committees. The Nominating and Governance Committee has oversight of our climate strategy and ESG matters and receives quarterly updates on our ESG performance. Our Board of Directors receives periodic updates on our ESG performance.
Marvell has an enterprise risk management process in place that may be leveraged to help identify potential climate-related risks and to assess the magnitude of such risks. We have already committed to and are in the process of setting a Science Based Target aligned with the latest climate science to remain within the 1.5°C warming limit established under the Paris Agreement. We have reported against the Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) framework in our Fiscal Year 2022 ESG Report and have conducted scenario analysis on the potential impacts of climate change to our business in alignment with the TCFD framework.
