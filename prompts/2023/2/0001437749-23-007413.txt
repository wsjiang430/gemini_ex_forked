Recent Developments
 
2021 Acquisitions
 
The Snelling Acquisition
 On March 1, 2021, we completed our acquisition of certain assets of Snelling Staffing ("Snelling") in accordance with the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement dated January 29, 2021 (the “Snelling Agreement”). At the time of acquisition, Snelling Staffing was an eminent staffing company headquartered in Richardson, TX. Pursuant to the Snelling Agreement, HQ Snelling Corporation (“HQ Snelling”), our wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired approximately 47 offices and substantially all of the operating assets, and assumed certain liabilities of the sellers for a purchase price of approximately $17.9 million (the "Snelling Acquisition"). Also on March 1, 2021, HQ Snelling entered into the First Amendment to the Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which HireQuest, Inc. agreed to advance $2.1 million to be paid to the sellers at closing to be used to pay accrued payroll liabilities that HQ Snelling assumed pursuant to the Snelling Agreement. We funded this acquisition with existing cash on hand and a draw on our then-existing line of credit with Truist Bank ("Truist").
The LINK Acquisition
 On March 22, 2021, we completed our acquisition of the franchise relationships and certain other assets of LINK Staffing (“LINK”) in accordance with the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement dated February 12, 2021 (the "LINK Agreement"). At the time of acquisition, LINK was a family-owned staffing company headquartered in Houston, TX. Pursuant to the LINK Agreement, HQ Link Corporation ("HQ Link"), our wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired approximately 35 franchised offices, customer lists and contracts, and other assets of LINK for a purchase price of approximately $11.1 million (the "LINK Acquisition"). We funded this acquisition with existing cash on hand.

 On October 1, 2021 we completed our acquisition of Recruit Media, Inc. (“Recruit Media”) in accordance with the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement dated October 1, 2021 (the “Recruit Agreement”). Pursuant to the Recruit Agreement, we purchased all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Recruit Media for approximately $4.4 million.

We funded this acquisition with existing cash on hand and a draw on our then-existing line of credit with Truist.
The Dental Power Acquisition
 On December 6, 2021 we completed our acquisition of the Dental Power Staffing division ("Dental Power") of Dental Power International, Inc. (“DPI”) in accordance with the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement dated November 2, 2021, for approximately $1.9 million. DPI is a 46-year-old dental staffing company headquartered in Carrboro, NC with long-standing client relationships in the dental industry providing temporary, long-term contract, and direct-hire staffing services to dental practices across the U.S. We funded this acquisition with existing cash on hand and a draw on our existing line of credit with Truist. We operated Dental Power as a company-owned location until the fourth quarter of 2022, when we classified it as held-for-sale. In the meantime, we continue to operate Dental Power as company-owned.
2022 Acquisitions
 
The Temporary Alternatives Acquisition
 On January 24, 2022 we completed our acquisition of certain assets of Temporary Alternatives in accordance with the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement dated  January 10, 2022 , including three locations in West Texas and New Mexico for approximately $7.0 million, inclusive of a prescribed amount of working capital. Temporary Alternatives is a staffing division of dmDickason Personnel Services, a family-owned company based in El Paso, TX. The acquisition of Temporary Alternatives will expand our national footprint into West Texas and grow our franchise base, and we immediately entered into a franchise agreement and sold the non-working capital assets acquired. We funded this acquisition with existing cash on hand and a draw on our existing line of credit with Truist.
The Dubin Acquisition
 On February 21, 2022 we completed our acquisition of the staffing operations of The Dubin Group, Inc., and Dubin Workforce Solutions, Inc. (collectively “Dubin”) in accordance with the terms of an Asset Purchase Agreement dated January 19, 2022 for approximately $2.5 million, inclusive of a prescribed amount of working capital. Dubin provides executive placement services and commercial staffing in the Philadelphia metropolitan area. The acquisition of Dubin will help expedite growth into a new staffing vertical, expand our national footprint, and grow our franchise base. We funded this acquisition with existing cash on hand, deferred purchase payments, and a draw on our existing line of credit with Truist. We divided Dubin into separate businesses and sold certain customer related assets of one of the acquired locations to a new franchisee. The remaining assets related to the operations of the other acquired locations have not been sold and as of December 31, 2022 and are classified as held-for-sale. In the meantime, we operate the Philadelphia franchise as company-owned.

Northbound provides executive placement and short-term consultant services primarily to blue chip clients in the financial services industry. The acquisition of Northbound will help expedite growth into a new staffing vertical, expand our national footprint, and grow our franchise base. We immediately entered into a franchise agreement and sold the customer-related assets acquired. We funded this acquisition with existing cash on hand, seller financing of $1.5 million, and a draw on our existing line of credit with Truist.
The MRINetwork Acquisition
 On December 12, 2022 we completed our acquisition of the certain assets of MRINetwork (“MRI”) in accordance with the terms of an Asset Purchase Agreement dated November 16, 2022, for approximately $13.3 million, inclusive of  a limited amount of working capital. MRI has been a leader in the recruitment industry since 1965 and has grown into one of the largest franchised executive search and recruitment organizations in the world.  As of December 31, 2022 there were approximately 210 active MRI franchises across the globe performing executive, managerial, and professional recruitment services. MRI also has a robust temporary / contract labor division with over $50 million in annual billings. We funded this acquisition with existing cash on hand, and a draw on our existing line of credit with Truist.

Our Model
 
We are a nationwide franchisor of temporary staffing offices providing direct-dispatch and commercial staffing solutions in the light industrial and blue-collar industries, and professional recruitment offices providing permanent placement services in the executive, managerial and administrative fields. Following the Merger, we began with a strong direct-dispatch program. With the Snelling Acquisition and the LINK Acquisition, we significantly expanded our traditional commercial staffing solutions. With the MRI Acquisition, we have added a third leg and firmly established ourselves as one of the top permanent placement firms in the United States. We are now able to offer total talent access to our clients and partners. 
 
Smaller acquisitions have helped us fill our map and provide our franchisees and customers more targeted offerings. Following the December 2021 acquisition of Dental Power, we used the platform to build a customer base in the dental-oriented sector of the staffing industry, which we believe benefits our entire system by increasing revenue opportunities under the HireQuest Health brand. In 2022, the Temporary Alternatives and Dubin acquisitions filled gaps in our geography. The Northbound acquisition did the same for New York City but also brought a high-class executive placement offering that we hope to leverage into other markets. 
 
In 2022, our franchisees operated under the trade names “HireQuest Direct,” “Snelling,” “HireQuest,” “DriverQuest,” “HireQuest Health,” "Northbound Executive Search," "Management Recruiters International," and "Sales Consultants." Many of the MRI franchises also operate under other brands specific to a locality. HireQuest Direct focuses on daily-work/daily-pay jobs primarily for construction and light industrial customers. Snelling and HireQuest focus on longer-term staffing positions in the light industrial and administrative arenas. DriverQuest specializes in both commercial and non-CDL drivers serving a variety of industries and applications. HireQuest Health specializes in skilled personnel in the healthcare and dental industries.  Northbound, MRI, and Sales Consultants focus on executive, managerial, and professional recruitment services, although many franchisees also offer short-term consultant and contract staffing services.
 
Our revenue, which is primarily comprised of royalty fees generated by the operations of our franchised offices, license fees, and interest charged to our franchisees on overdue accounts receivable, was $31.0 million in 2022. This does not include revenue from locations currently owned by us as those are classified as held-for-sale and reported as discontinued operations.  Our system-wide sales, which we define as sales at all offices, whether owned and operated by us or by our franchisees, were $472.2 million in 2022. Nearly all system-wide-sales originated from franchisee-owned offices. We employed approximately 82 thousand temporary employees and contracted with 120 independent contractors during 2022. At December 31, 2022, we had approximately 435 franchisee-owned offices operating in 45 states, the District of Columbia, and 13 countries outside the United States. On a net basis, we opened 218 offices in 2022 (acquiring 207, opening 16, and closing 5). We also licensed our tradenames to 10 locations in California. There were 12 MRI locations that provided contract staffing only which are not included in the office count.
 
We provide incentives to our existing franchisees, including assistance with start-up funding and acquisition costs, to encourage them to expand into new markets and industries. While staffing industry growth has outpaced overall economic and employment growth, the industry still employs only a small percentage of the United States’ non-farm workforce. We believe that the low percentage of the total workforce that is currently contingent, when combined with potential shifts towards a more contingent workforce in the overall economy, provides meaningful opportunities for future organic growth.
 
Our differentiated services are driven by three key elements:
 

● | Local ownership and dedicated responsiveness. Our offices are franchisee-owned. We believe that ownership at the local level, where the vast majority of customer interactions occur, allows our organization to be agile and responsive to customer needs. Since our franchisees have a personal financial interest in the success of their offices, our customers interact with a representative who is incentivized to deliver excellent customer service and resolve issues efficiently. In addition, franchise owners are able to develop long-term relationships due to the lack of turnover. We believe the combination of local ownership coupled with properly-aligned incentives results in enhanced customer satisfaction and greater customer retention.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Direct dispatch from our offices. The majority of our employees in our construction and light industrial segment are dispatched from our offices every day. This allows our franchisees and their staff to qualify the employees for work, provide them with any necessary personal protective equipment, assist them in arranging transportation amongst themselves, and ensure the right number of qualified individuals are dispatched at the right time. We believe that employee dispatch from franchise offices increases consistency as our employees are sent to a particular jobsite without having to rely on less reliable means of verification, such as telephone calls. Once we and our customers have developed a rapport with particular employees, we will sometimes dispatch these employees directly to a customer location.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Proprietary tools and processes. We have developed rigorous training, proprietary tools, and time-proven processes that empower our franchise offices to manage labor and place talent efficiently and effectively, and our varied brand portfolio and wide geographical presence brings diverse experiences and perspectives to the table. With our collaborative inter-office and inter-brand culture, franchisees have vast resources to draw up on to grow and scale their businesses.

Our Industry
 
Temporary Staffing and Permanent Recruiting 
 According to the American Staffing Association (ASA), the staffing and recruiting industry in the United States generated record annual revenue of $168 billion in 2021 (even after a revenue dip in 2020). Approximately 75% of industry revenue is generated by temporary and contract employee staffing services, with the remainder coming from executive recruiting and permanent placement, outsourcing / outplacement, and human resource consulting. Following the acquisitions completed in 2021 and 2022, we are expanding into or increasing our presence in several of the remaining segments of the staffing industry including permanent placement, health care, clerical and administrative, and professional.
 
The direct-dispatch and commercial staffing industry has developed based on a business need for flexible staffing solutions. The industry provides contingent workforce solutions as an alternative to the costs and efforts that are required for recruiting, hiring, and managing permanent employees. Many of the customers our franchisees target operate in a cyclical production environment and find it difficult to staff according to their changing business requirements. Companies also desire a way to maintain consistent staffing levels when full-time employees are absent due to illness, vacation, or unplanned terminations. Direct-dispatch staffing offers customers the opportunity to respond immediately to changes in staffing needs, to reduce the costs associated with recruiting and interviewing, to eliminate unemployment and workers’ compensation exposure, and to draw from a larger pool of potential employees. We have found that staffing firms provide particular value in assisting customers with filling mundane or repetitive jobs, high turnover positions, staffing for project specific needs, and filling other short duration positions such as special events, disaster recovery, and seasonal jobs.
 
Our permanent placement franchisees help businesses eliminate the costs and efforts that are required for sourcing and recruiting permanent employees. We have found that, particularly in times of low unemployment, permanent placement franchisees can assist customers in finding the right candidate for a specific role.
 
Historically, our business has been bolstered by declining unemployment rates as our customers find it more difficult and more expensive to recruit, interview, hire, and train qualified staff. As employers look for alternatives to combat these increasing costs and administrative burdens, opportunities arise for the temporary staffing and permanent placement industry. Worker attitudes have changed from one which idealized extended tenure with a single employer to one which is more open to temporary or transient employment. According to ASA reports, most staffing employees (73%) work full time, comparable to the overall workforce (75%). Six in 10 staffing employees (64%) work in the industry to fill in the gap between jobs or to help them find a job. One in five (20%) cite schedule flexibility as a reason for choosing temporary/contract work in the gap between jobs or to help them land a job. This shift has increased the availability of temporary workers in the economy as a whole.
 
Conversely, periods of declining unemployment are a challenge for our industry.
 
Government Regulation
 While the offices under our brands are operated by franchisees, three of our wholly-owned subsidiaries serve as the employer of record of the temporary employees. As a large employer, we are subject to a significant number of employment laws at the state, federal, and local levels. We are required to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to employment, including verification of eligibility for employment, occupational safety and health provisions, wage and hour requirements, employment insurance, and laws relating to equal opportunity employment. In addition to federal and state laws and regulations, many counties and cities have become active in regulating various aspects of employment, including minimum wages, living wages, paid sick leave, retirement savings programs, transportation benefits, application forms and background checks, mandatory training, and required notices to employees, among others.
 
In addition, fourteen states and the Federal Trade Commission impose pre-sale franchise registration or disclosure requirements on franchisors. A number of states also regulate substantive aspects of our relationship with our franchisees such as termination, nonrenewal, transfer, no-poach and non-competition provisions, discrimination among franchisees, and other aspects of the relationships between and with franchisees. Additional legislation, which we cannot predict, could expand these requirements imposed on us. Significant expansion could lead to a significant increase in compliance costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. 
 
Our Competitive Strengths
 
We attribute our success to the following strengths:
 

● | Nationwide footprint with differentiated business model. We believe we are one of the largest providers of direct-dispatch temporary staffing solutions in the light industrial and blue-collar segments of the staffing industry measured by number of offices. Our nationwide footprint allows us to compete for national account relationships not available to many of our local or regional competitors. Our size also allows us to obtain favorable terms on our workers’ compensation insurance program. Our franchise model has many advantages as well. Most of our competitors utilize a company-owned office model in which management of day-to-day interactions with customers is handled by individuals who do not have the same incentive to succeed as franchisees have as owners of their businesses. The company-owned model typically requires significant investment in middle management to overcome this lack of incentive. We largely avoid this expense because our franchisees are independent business owners responsible for their own financial well-being, and in doing so increase our store level economics.

● | A franchise system with expansion capabilities. We incentivize our franchisees to expand their own businesses through our Franchise Expansion Incentive Program. Under this program, we offer assistance overcoming the startup costs of an office in a new metropolitan area or industry by providing our existing franchisees with credits on the royalty fees they pay in their existing offices. In addition, under certain circumstances, we will provide assistance in acquisition funding or financing. Our acquisitions continue to offer new models for our existing franchisees who may be interested in exploring another segment of the temporary staffing and permanent placement industry. We also maintain a Risk Management Incentive Program which allows us to reward franchisees who are successful in keeping their workers' compensation loss ratios below certain thresholds by providing them a credit on their royalties. We believe that this incentivizes our franchisees to encourage workplace safety, while also providing franchisees with capital to reinvest in, or expand, their businesses.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Responsible capital allocation with very little debt. Financing our day-to-day needs largely with cash produced from operations allows us to continue building cash reserves which we can use, in addition to our bank line of credit, to finance significant transactions such as major reinvestments in our business, strategic acquisitions, share buybacks, or stockholder dividends, depending on the opportunities that present themselves. Compared to company-owned offices, our franchise model allows us to employ relatively fewer full-time staff at our corporate headquarters decreasing the working capital needed for operations. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Growth Strategy
 
We believe there are considerable opportunities to grow our business and brands. The following are key components of our growth strategy:
 

● | Make strategic acquisitions. We are continuously evaluating acquisition opportunities that will allow us to expand our franchisee base, expand the number of industries our franchisees service, and diversify our national footprint.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continue to grow the number of offices our franchisees operate. We believe attractive returns at the franchisee level position us to continue to attract new franchisees and encourage our existing franchisees to open new offices. In addition, we encourage our existing franchisees to explore new potential markets through our Franchise Expansion Incentive Program. When combined with the back-office support that we provide franchisees, we believe we are poised to expand into unserved or underserved markets.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Capitalize on our national footprint to grow same store and system-wide sales. We anticipate that our enhanced scale combined with our royalty-driven business model will contribute to growth in our access to and profitability from national accounts. Traditionally, these larger national accounts have the leverage to impose lower margins on their temporary staffing providers. Our royalty-driven business model, in which we earn a percentage of gross billings or funded payroll regardless of margins, partially insulates stockholders from short-term margin volatility inherent in the ownership of the traditional company-owned model for temporary staffing.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increase our brand awareness. As we continue to develop new markets and to serve our existing markets, we expect our brands to become more recognizable and a greater asset to us in driving repeat customers, encouraging customers to expand their use of our services across multiple markets, and increasing new customer development.

Our Offices
 
Domestic:
 
We had 435 offices located in 45 states, the District of Columbia, and 13 countries other than the United States as of December 31, 2022. All of these offices were franchised, except the Dental Power office (acquired in the DPI transaction) and the Philadelphia office (acquired as part of the Dubin transaction). There were also 12 MRI locations that provided contract staffing services only which we did not include in the office count. Finally, we licensed our trademarks for use in 10 locations in California. The map below provides the number of offices we had in each state.
Number of Offices By State
 December 31, 2022
 
  

We have a strong concentration of offices in established and emerging regions such as the Southeast, Florida, Texas, the Rust Belt, Colorado, and Washington. These regional office concentrations contribute to greater brand recognition while we continue to add offices in unserved and underserved regions. These concentrations also allow us to better recognize local and regional market trends. 
International:
 
In the MRI transaction we acquired 19 non-US offices located in 13 countries. International operations transact with us using US dollars, and currently only placement services are provided outside of the United States.
Our Franchise Program
 
Our franchised offices are a key component of our success. We urge our franchisees to customize their services according to the unique opportunities and assets available at each of their offices, while also leveraging the overall size of the organization whenever possible. This approach allows for each office to have a unique blend of customers and emphases while also reducing overhead costs, improving economies of scale, establishing procedural uniformity and controls, and creating a predictable internal environment for temporary employees.
 
A typical franchised office is managed by an owner with the assistance of in-office personnel employed directly by the franchise and not by us. Many offices hire business development staff and recruiters to help drive business to the offices. We provide advice and guidance from our corporate headquarters.
 
Franchising Strategy
 As of December 31, 2022, there were approximately 435 franchised Snelling, HireQuest, HireQuest Direct, and MRI offices operated by 363 franchisees. Approximately 15% of our franchisees owned multiple offices. Our largest franchisee owned 12 offices, and about 5% of our franchisees owned 4 or more offices. One individual owned significant interest in 7 franchisees that operated 25 offices. We also had 27 franchisees that share common ownership with significant stockholders, directors, and officers of the Company. We refer to these as the "Worlds Franchisees." These 27 Worlds Franchisees operated 67 offices as of December 31, 2022.
 
Our approach to the franchise model creates what we believe to be superior office-level economics. We finance many of the initial working capital needs of our franchisees, including costs of new office openings, through our ownership of franchisee accounts receivable which we acquire through our franchise agreements. This is a relatively inexpensive source of capital for our franchisees and allows them to expand more freely. In addition, our Risk Management Incentive Program lowers the effective cost of workers’ compensation insurance at the franchisee level – a significant expense for many of our competitors. We thereby eliminate two of the largest barriers to entry for our franchisees:  financing and workers’ compensation, and enable potentially higher operating margins at the office level.

Franchise Agreements - Temporary Staffing
 Our temporary staffing franchise agreements contain standard terms and conditions. In most cases, our franchisees are granted the exclusive right to operate their chosen brand, either Snelling, HireQuest or HireQuest Direct, in their protected territory. Typically, a protected territory corresponds with the metropolitan statistical area where the office is located. In a small number of densely populated cities, the protected territories are smaller.
 
As of December 31, 2022, our temporary staffing franchisees operated under 158 executed franchise agreements. For our HireQuest Direct brand we charge a royalty fee of between 6% and 8% of gross temporary labor sales, depending on sales volume. For temporary labor through our Snelling and HireQuest brands, including HireQuest franchisees, Snelling franchisees, LINK Franchisees, DriverQuest franchisees, HireQuest Health franchisees, and Northbound franchises, we charge a royalty fee of 4.5% of the payroll we fund plus 18% of the gross margin for the territory. Most franchise agreements require a royalty of 5% - 7% of direct  placement sales.
 
For the Snelling franchise agreements we assumed where the franchise owner did not execute a new HireQuest or HireQuest Direct franchise agreement, the royalty fee ranges from 5% to 8% of all sales.
 
Our typical temporary staffing franchise agreement has a term of five years, although some that we have assumed in acquisitions have longer terms. Our temporary staffing franchise agreement is designed to remove some of the most significant barriers to entry in our industry – access to working capital, access to affordable workers’ compensation insurance, and dedicated software. By entering into a franchisee agreement with us, our franchisees gain access to our proprietary software, HQ WebConnect©, which we update regularly through a dedicated staff of developers, and gain access to working capital by factoring their accounts receivable through us. Additionally, in states that do not require participation in a state-run program, our franchisees gain access to our "A++" rated workers’ compensation insurance coverage.
 
Franchise Agreements - Permanent Placement
 We assumed the vast majority of our permanent placement franchise agreements from Management Recruiters International, Inc. in December 2022. There are a significant number of variations among the agreements. The vast majority of franchisees are not granted any exclusive territory. Historically, the franchisees have been encouraged to focus on a particular demographic, industry, or geography. 
 
As of December 21, 2022, our MRI franchisees operated under 207 executed franchise agreements. We charge a royalty fee of between 1.0% of total cash in plus a minimum of at least $15,000 to 9.0% of total cash in. The MRI franchises with a lower royalty scale generally pay a flat annual fee plus a percentage-based royalty. For temporary labor, MRI franchises pay a royalty that ranges from 20% to 25% of payroll, depending on sales volume. Some customers that utilize qualified independent contractors cause the franchise to pay a royalty that ranges from 4% to 10% of contractor payments, depending on sales volume.
 
Our typical MRI franchise agreement has a term of ten years, although there is significant variability in the term with some being much longer. We plan to standardize our agreements as they come up for renewal. 
 
All Franchisees receive initial and ongoing training in our technology and methods of operation. We provide support personnel on an as-needed basis to our franchisees. We have a comprehensive brand standards manual which explains our policies on key operational, financial, and regulatory compliance issues. Under the franchise agreement, beneficial owners of our franchisees guaranty all debts and obligations of the franchise to us. Still, we have substantially less control over a franchisee’s operations than we would if we owned and operated an office ourselves. Franchisees are not required to provide full financial statements oHr other information that is outside of the royalty base.

Our Human Capital Resources
 
Temporary Employees
 Our temporary employees are a key component of our success. We consider them one of our most valuable assets as they perform the services our franchises provide. Hire Quest, LLC, DriverQuest 2, LLC, and HQ Medical, LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiaries, are the employer of record of all temporary employees of the HireQuest Direct, Snelling, HireQuest, DriverQuest, HireQuest Health, and Northbound brands. All temporary employees employed via contract staffing in the MRI brand are employed through People 2.0. In 2022, we employed approximately 82 thousand temporary employees and contracted with 120 independent contractors. Our systems generated approximately 1.5 million paychecks. The vast majority of these payments were made via electronic transfer or paycard. Given the nature of temporary employment, it is difficult for us to determine the exact number of full-time employees on a given day, however, approximately 670 temporary employees worked at least 1,800 hours in 2021.
 
    9 

  

These temporary employees served thousands of customers, primarily in the construction, industrial/manufacturing, warehousing, hospitality, recycling/waste management, and disaster recovery industries. Our customers range in size from small, local businesses to large, multi-national corporations. Most of our work assignments are short-term, and many are filled with little advance notice from customers.
 
We continuously recruit temporary staff so we can respond to customer needs quickly. We attract our employees through various means, including in-person recruitment, online resources, cell phone texting services, our large and ever-growing internal database, job fairs, word-of-mouth, digital and print advertisements, and a number of other methods. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain temporary employees. To that end, we have implemented a robust health insurance program giving qualifying temporary employees a list of plans to choose from, including Affordable Care Act (ACA) compliant coverage.
 
The safety of our temporary employees remains one of our highest priorities. We regularly provide safety and skills training. We also aggressively manage our workers' compensation program to identify trends in injuries and limit our losses and exposure. Through our Risk Management Incentive Program, our franchisees are incentivized to ensure safe working environments and to achieve quick resolutions of workers' compensation claims when they do arise.
 
Corporate Employees
 We believe our success also depends on our ability to attract, develop, and retain talented employees at our corporate headquarters. The skills, experience, and industry knowledge of our employees significantly benefit our operations and performance. We believe a strong, positive corporate culture and employee engagement is key to attracting and retaining talented employees. Executives of the company set this tone at the top, and we routinely have Company functions designed to engage and integrate our employees into our culture. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary HQ LTS Corporation, we employed 124 distinct corporate employees during 2022, with 103 active at December 31, 2022. Most of these individuals are employed at our corporate headquarters in Goose Creek, SC. The vast majority of these employees are full-time. These employees provide back-office support, including financing, insurance, accounting, operations, national sales, information technology, legal, and human resources services to our franchisees and temporary employees.

Our Competition
 
The staffing industry is highly fragmented and highly competitive, with relatively low barriers to entry aside from payroll funding, workers’ compensation premiums, and startup costs. No single staffing company dominates the industry. Our competitors range in size from small, local or regional operators with five or fewer offices to large, multi-national companies with hundreds or thousands of offices around the world. Some of our competitors are publicly traded corporations that have the same access to capital as we do. Our strongest competition in any market comes from companies that have established long-lasting relationships with their clients. Competition in the industry tends to track the overall strength of the economy and trends in workforce flexibility. As the economy grows, the number of competitors generally increases.
 
There are even fewer barriers to entry with recruiting and placement services. With little to no overhead required, no payroll funding, and no workers' compensation, the executive recruitment industry is extremely spread out and extremely competitive. In most areas, no single company has a dominant share of the market. In addition to us, several large publicly owned companies specialize in recruitment services, and we also compete against a variety of regional or specialized companies. 
 
The primary competitive factors in our market includes price, the ability to provide the requested workers on a timely basis, and success in meeting customer expectations. Secondary factors include customer relationships, name recognition, and established reputation. Businesses operating in these areas of the staffing industry require access to significant working capital to pay temporary employees, particularly in the spring and summer when seasonal staffing requirements are highest, and to fund workers' compensation premiums and claims. Lack of working capital can be a significant impediment to growth for small, local, and regional staffing service providers. A second barrier to entry is an affordable workers’ compensation policy. Small entrants usually do not have the scale necessary to secure a policy on terms similar to ours. Regulatory compliance is becoming more burdensome, particularly for smaller firms that cannot profitably comply with the increasing number of federal, state, and local employment laws and regulations.
 
Our Cyclicality and Seasonality
 
The temporary staffing industry has historically been cyclical. Success tends to track the economy. When our franchisees’ customers expect to have long-term permanent needs, they tend to increase their use of temporary employees. Our revenue tends to increase as the economy expands, and conversely, our revenue tends to decrease when the economy contracts.

Some of the industries in which we operate are subject to seasonal fluctuation. Many of the jobs filled by temporary employees are outdoors and generally performed during the warmer months of the year. As a result, activity increases in the spring and continues at higher levels through the summer, then begins to taper off during fall and through winter. In addition, demand by industrial customers tends to slow after the holiday season and pick up again in the third and fourth quarters – peaking in the third quarter. Our exposure to seasonality is mitigated, in part, by our strong presence in the Southern United States where seasonal fluctuations are typically less pronounced. In addition, we have noticed that our seasonality has been mitigated by the addition of Snelling, which focuses on weekly-paid employees. We expect seasonality to decrease even further as a result of the MRI Acquisition as the MRI franchisees are involved in permanent placement which may be subject to less seasonality than on-demand employment.
