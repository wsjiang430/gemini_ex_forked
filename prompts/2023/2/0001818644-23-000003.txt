Item 1. Business
General
We are a provider of high-performance, active lidar systems technology for vehicle autonomy, advanced driver-assistance systems, or ADAS, and robotic vision applications. We have developed an artificial intelligence technology that enables adaptive “intelligent sensing,” differentiating us in the marketplace from our competition. Our proprietary software-definable 4SightTM Intelligent Sensing Platform combines solid-state active lidar, an optionally fused low-light HD camera, and integrated deterministic artificial intelligence to capture more intelligent information with less data, enabling faster, more accurate, and more reliable perception of the surroundings.
We were founded in 2013 by Luis Dussan, our Chief Technology Officer, to create a deterministic AI-driven sensing system that performs better than the human eye and visual cortex. Mr. Dussan’s experience developing mission-critical targeting systems for fighter jets and ground troops on behalf of the U.S. military provided him with the background to develop a differentiated approach to visual sensing. While traditional sensing systems passively collect data, our active 4SightTM Intelligent Sensing Platform leverages principles from automated targeting systems and biomimicry to scan the environment, while intelligently focusing on what matters in order to enable safer, smarter, and faster decisions in complex scenarios. From our inception, our culture drew from esteemed scientists and electro-optics engineers from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or NASA, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, the U.S. Air Force, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, to create the highest performing sensing and perception system for the most challenging situations, ensuring the highest levels of safety for autonomous driving. 
As a result, our adaptive lidar is designed to enable higher levels of autonomy and functionality — SAE Levels 2 through 5 — with the goal of optimizing performance, power, and reducing cost. Our 4Sight Intelligent Sensing Platform is software-definable and network-optimized, and leverages deterministic artificial intelligence at the edge. We have made substantial investments in our R&D processes and deliver value to our customers through a combination of sales and direct channels. We perform the majority of our R&D activities in our 56,549 square foot corporate headquarters in Dublin, California. Our modular design facilitates product hardware updates as technologies evolve, and its small size and modest heat dissipation enable very flexible placement options on the interior or exterior of a vehicle. 4Sight also leverages a common architecture to create application-specific products across the Automotive and Industrial markets.
Our systems-based approach encourages partnership from the well-established automotive supply chain, including original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, as well as Tier 1 and Tier 2 OEM suppliers. There is strong alignment between us and our partners given what is required to produce high-performance automotive grade products at scale, including quality, reliability, and affordability. Our Tier 1 partners will add value with OEM customers through industrialization, manufacturing, integration, sales, marketing, product liability, and warranty. Our Tier 2 partners will provide automotive-grade sub-components, which are used not only in automotive lidar for ADAS use cases, but also for our products to be sold in the Industrial market. We expect the result will be a high-
quality, high-performance product at the right price point, which we believe to be a key enabler in accelerating adoption of lidar across various markets in Automotive and beyond.
In pursuing this strategy, we have partnered with leading Tier 1 automotive suppliers, including Continental, who is in the process of bidding for long range lidar series production awards with OEMs that are expected to represent a substantial portion of our future revenues. The main markets for lidar, including Automotive and Industrial, are projected to see significant growth in both the near and long term. We believe this expected growth will allow us to capture significant market share as well as pursue specialization opportunities like highway autonomous driving applications that benefit from our products. We expect that lidar will be a required sensing solution across many end markets, and we intend to be the leading solutions provider in these spaces. 
Market Outlook/Overview
We believe that lidar will be a required sensing solution across many end markets. We broadly define our two key end markets as Automotive and Industrial.
Automotive
We believe that lidar will be a critical component of ADAS and fully autonomous driving or self-driving systems. Applications for the Automotive end market include lidar sensors and software for passenger and commercial vehicles. Automotive and commercial vehicle OEMs are expected to introduce lidar sensors to add ADAS features and improve safety for passengers and pedestrians. For vehicles to achieve greater autonomous functionality and perform those functions at higher speeds, we believe long-range lidar will be necessary. Our sensors were designed to search, detect, acquire, and track small objects at long distances. We may also introduce other mid- and short-range lidar systems based on the same 4Sight Intelligent Sensing Platform. Our system is particularly well-suited to reduce the intensive compute (and associated power and latency) requirements of autonomous systems because our platform handles critical data processing at the sensor level, thereby allowing the self-driving system to focus limited compute resources on the vehicle's path planning. We believe that our strategy to partner with Tier 1 automotive suppliers to produce high-quality, long-range lidar at scale will drive adoption of lidar in series production across major global OEMs.
•Passenger vehicle ADAS — highway autonomy in passenger vehicles is a highly relevant use case for our technology, as passenger vehicle OEMs are actively in the process of adding new features that enhance the consumer driving experience. These highway systems rely on consistent detection of dangerous, often small, obstacles at long distances and high speeds, which our system can optimize for in software.
•Commercial vehicle ADAS — hub-to-hub autonomy in commercial vehicles, such as short- and long-range delivery vehicles, enabled by lidar, promises similar technological utility to that in passenger vehicles. Importantly, however, the value that a commercial vehicle operator derives from commercial ADAS is driven by increased utility and safety through reduced risk from driver fatigue. We believe that adoption rates for long-range lidar will be higher in commercial vehicles initially due to the significant share of time that highway driving represents for commercial customers.
Industrial
We believe there are a broad range of use cases for lidar in Industrial markets, including but not limited to rail, construction, mining, agriculture, aerospace, defense, and intelligent transportation systems.
•Rail — detecting and acquiring railway debris at long distances to stop the train to prevent derailment; assessing tracks for maintenance needs; and monitoring platform safety.
•Construction, Mining, & Agriculture — detecting and acquiring obstacles, pedestrians, and animals in the path of large, autonomous construction and mining vehicles and agricultural equipment.
•Aerospace & Defense — detecting wires or other obstacles above ground for helicopters; automating logistics vehicles for the military; enabling mid-air refueling.
•Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) — intersection traffic management, tolling automation, smart mobility infrastructure, autonomous/smart parking, and work zone safety.
Commercial
Overview
We employ two different go-to-market models: one model addresses the traditional Automotive end market and the other model addresses the Industrial end market.
We employ a channel model in the traditional Automotive market by working through Tier 1 suppliers that sell products to OEM customers. Those Tier 1 suppliers will industrialize, manufacture, and sell lidar sensor solution units to OEMs that incorporate our proprietary design and software. We expect that we will receive royalty payments from those Tier 1 suppliers for each unit they sell to their OEM customers. Royalties may take the form of a fixed amount per unit, a percentage of the average selling price of the sensor, profit-sharing, or some combination of these methods. We work alongside our Tier 1 supplier partners to quote new business according to the OEM’s specifications. Our announced Tier 1 supplier engagements include Continental. We are also currently engaged in partnership discussions with other Tier 1 suppliers.
For the Industrial market, we either sell directly to the customer or through systems integrators. Contract manufacturers with whom we have agreements, assemble, test, and deliver these products. Direct sales constitute sales of units to upgrade systems or otherwise add on to an existing product, while systems integrators will build our technology into mass produced systems, such as autonomous mining haulers, locomotives, or intelligent transportation systems.
Our lidar products employ a single product platform that is based on components sourced from an established Tier 2 automotive supply chain to drive down costs and increase reliability. We expect to utilize those same components to address the Industrial market, which enables us to leverage our volume in automotive, and drive costs down for the products made by our contract manufacturing partners.
Relationship with Continental
Continental, which refers to Continental AG together with its subsidiaries, is one of the largest Tier 1 automotive suppliers globally as measured by revenue. Continental is also a leading provider of ADAS products, supplying more than 25 OEMs, 50 brands, and 300 vehicle models globally, having shipped over 100 million ADAS products over the last three years, including radar, camera, autonomous driving compute units, and complementary flash lidar for short-range applications.
In October 2020, we and Continental publicly announced a strategic partnership whereby Continental will manufacture and integrate our lidar products into OEM model lines through long-term series production contracts with OEMs. Continental, after evaluating a wide range of competing solutions, entered into a Joint Development Agreement in 2021 with us setting forth the basis for a long-range lidar technology partnership.
Continental is currently engaged in multiple OEM purchasing processes using us as its technology design partner. Continental is planning a manufacturing facility with a 2024 anticipated start of production. It is expected that the full production line capacity will be contractually committed through Continental for various series production car models over the next few years.
For production lines that utilize our product design, Continental will purchase the hardware components from a group of approved automotive-grade Tier 2 suppliers manufacturing our component designs. We expect that for each unit that Continental sells based upon our licensed product design, Continental will pay us a royalty.
Technology
We developed the 4Sight Intelligent Sensing Platform, to combine solid-state active lidar, an optionally fused low-light HD camera, and integrated deterministic artificial intelligence to capture more intelligent information with less data, enabling faster, more accurate, and more reliable perception of the surroundings. The 4Sight Intelligent Sensing Platform enables the integration of various types of sensor inputs, including camera, lidar, and radar. Our 4Sight products are developed on this framework and incorporate both camera and lidar sensors.
The 4Sight Intelligent Sensing Platform leverages a bistatic architecture, allowing for physically separated transmit and receive paths. This improves range, refresh rate, and resolution over conventional coaxial architectures employed by our competitors, by allowing the transmitter to direct energy independently of the receiver’s focus. The lidar system employs time-of-flight based scanning, delivered with extremely low latency.
The laser we utilize is a 1550nm fiber laser. The 1550nm wavelength provides a photon budget far exceeding (>100x) 905nm lasers, and because 1550nm is a retina-safe wavelength, more energy can be utilized by lidar solutions using 1550nm lasers.
We leverage custom high resonance micro-electro-mechanical systems, or MEMS, for agile scanning over a wide field of view. The MEMS that we use are extremely small when compared to competing MEMS-based lidar solutions, and when coupled with the extremely high resonant frequency at which they can operate, our MEMS meet and exceed shock and vibration requirements for the Automotive and Industrial markets.
The bistatic architecture that we use is key to our proprietary camera-lidar system integration. By separating the send and receive paths, we can boresight align a camera imager with the laser transmitter. While the lidar delivers deterministic 3D data, the camera is additive for interpreting human-designed contextual clues, such as the color of stop lights or the words on a road sign. The camera integration is optional, therefore, we also intend to offer lidar-only solutions to our customers.
All of the data collected is processed directly on the system-on-a-chip, where our algorithms continually evaluate the certainty of object detection in order to direct system energy and focus.
4Sight Intelligent Sensing Platform
4Sight is our proprietary lidar intelligent sensing platform. This intelligence is enabled by our patented bistatic architecture, which keeps the transmit and receive channels separate, allowing 4Sight to optimize for both. As each laser pulse is transmitted, the receiver is told where and when to look for its return. Ultimately, this establishes the 4Sight platform as active — allowing it to focus on what matters most in a vehicle’s surroundings.
The result mimics how the human visual cortex conceptually focuses on and evaluates the environment around the vehicle, driving conditions, and road hazards, enabling smarter, more accurate decision making — radically improving the probability of detection and the accuracy of classification. The sensor captures more intelligent information with less data, enabling faster, more accurate and more reliable perception.
We have identified four increasingly complex levels of software which differentiate our system:
1.4Sight at Design: 4Sight at Design (software configured scan patterns) enables customers to create a single, deterministic scan pattern to deliver optimal information for any specific use case. This level is particularly beneficial for repetitive motion applications, such as power line or pipeline inspection (which cameras alone cannot achieve), or robots in a closed-loop environment that is unlikely to experience anything unexpected. Through 4Sight at Design, the customers’ unique, deterministic scan pattern will give them precisely the information they need for their repetitive pattern application.
2.Triggered 4Sight: With Triggered 4Sight, customers can create a library of deterministic, software-configurable scan patterns at design time, each one addressing a specific use case. Maps, IMU, speed, tilt, weather, and direction of the vehicle can all trigger the sensor to switch from one scan pattern to another. For example, a customer can create different scan patterns for highway, urban, and suburban driving, as well as an “exit ramp” pattern. In addition, the customer can create scan patterns for those same driving environments, but optimized for bad weather (e.g., “highway rain scan pattern” vs “highway sunlight scan pattern”).
3.Responsive 4Sight: With Responsive 4Sight, scan patterns are created at design and run time. In this level, the entire platform is completely software-configurable and situationally aware, adjusting, in real time, how it scans the scene, where to apply density and extra power, and what scan rate to employ. In this level, deterministic feedback loops or other sensors, such as camera and radar, inform the lidar to interrogate objects discretely or via dense, dynamic regions of interest, or ROIs, at various points throughout the scene. It can also dynamically alter its scan pattern on the fly. The system is intelligent, with the ability to interrogate the scene, and perpetually optimize its own scan patterns and data collection to focus on the information that matters most and respond based on firmware feedback.
4.Predictive 4Sight: Predictive 4Sight (motion forecasting) can take what is offered in Responsive 4Sight but look ahead enabling even smarter interrogation. In this level, basic perception can be distributed to the edge of the sensor network. Predictive 4Sight seeks to understand the motion of everything it sees, thereby enabling the system to deliver more information with less data by focusing its energy on the most important objects in a scene while paying attention to everything else in its periphery. Predictive 4Sight can “sense” (i.e., predict) where an object will be at different times in the future, enabling the vehicle to solve challenging edge cases.
4Sight for Automotive
Built on a modular architecture, the 4Sight series is easily customizable to address the specific design requirements for multiple Automotive OEMs. Industrialized, manufactured, tested, and validated by our Tier 1 partners, the 4Sight series features industry leading, long-range ADAS performance, designed to address the need for high-performance applications. 4Sight is built on our patented 1550nm, solid-state, active lidar. We expect that the 4Sight solutions for Automotive will generally utilize one of the first three software levels described above: 4Sight at Design, Triggered 4Sight, or Responsive 4Sight. 
We believe the unique combination of features of 4Sight include:
•Active lidar enables user’s choice of deterministic scan patterns catered to specific use cases and applications, such as highway autopilot;
•Feature-specific Fixed Regions of Interest (ROIs) designed to detect threats from various locations;
•Lidar perception made available through a software reference library;
•Windshield, grill, and other discreet vehicle integration options that are optimized by software configurability;
•Size, Weight, and Power (“SWaP”) optimized; and
•Functional Safety (“FuSa”)/Safety of the Intended Functionality (“SOTIF” or ISO 21448) compliant for signal path — providing necessary determinism for testing and validation.
4Sight for Industrial
Built on our unique 4Sight Intelligent Sensing Platform, 4Sight meets the diverse array of performance and functional requirements for the Industrial market with our industry-leading lidar performance, integrated intelligence, advanced vision capabilities, and unmatched reliability and safety. 4Sight is a cost-effective, customizable perception solution that leverages the complete 4Sight software platform and includes a comprehensive software development kit for an extensible roadmap to autonomous functionality. 4Sight for the Industrial market may utilize any of the four software levels described above: 4Sight at Design, Triggered 4Sight, Responsive 4Sight, or Predictive 4Sight.
Flexible sensor location within the car
Our design allows for unique flexibility with respect to sensor placement for two key reasons. First, our performance is not significantly impaired by first surfaces, such as stray light reflected off of a windshield or the plastic used in the fascia or headlight. Second, the unit’s power requirements and small form factor makes it easier for OEM designers to integrate our sensors into a variety of locations in a vehicle, such as behind the windshield. Competing solutions, on the other hand, may need to be integrated into the roof of the car in order to resolve challenges with excess heat or size. As a result, OEMs that install competing products may need to substantially alter the physical appearance of their vehicles to accommodate those products.
Competition
Lidar-based perception solutions for autonomous applications is an emerging market with a wide variety of possible applications across many different markets. We face competition from numerous companies worldwide that are developing lidar solutions, and some of these solutions may use a similar wavelength or scanning methodology. 
For example, we and at least one of our major competitors both use lasers that have a 1550nm wavelength. Other competitors use MEMS-based scanning technologies, but we believe our MEMS solution is uniquely robust due its small size and high resonant frequency. In addition to companies focused specifically on developing lidar solutions, we also face competition from current or potential partners and customers that may be developing lidar solutions internally. We believe that many of the other companies developing lidar solutions are focused on shorter-range sensors that passively collect data, and most of these sensors utilize 905nm lasers that limit their performance. We believe that we are differentiated from competitors by virtue of our active, embedded artificial intelligence approach that enables our lidar sensors to dynamically adapt to changing environments. In addition, we believe that our product design delivers longer range and higher resolution than many of our competitors. This is possible, in part, because we utilize 1550nm lasers that enable our lidar solutions to achieve a higher photon budget than many of our competitors that rely upon 905nm lasers. While 1550nm lasers are more costly than 905nm lasers on a per unit basis, 1550nm lasers have much higher performance and our product only requires one such laser. Some 905nm systems utilize up to 128 lasers and still don’t attain the performance results we achieve with a single 1550 nm laser. As a result, we believe that we are able to compete favorably in the lidar market, particularly in market segments such as highway autonomous driving applications that can benefit from our active, long-range, high-resolution capabilities.
We believe that our modular, patented design, our embedded artificial intelligence, which is inherently enabled by our unique product, and our strong R&D capabilities will enable us to remain a technology leader in the lidar market.
Research and Development
We have made substantial investments into our R&D efforts historically, and we expect to substantially increase our investments in this area in the future. We believe that this is essential to maintain our position as a provider of one of the most advanced lidar solutions in the market. While our R&D activities occur primarily at our headquarters in Dublin, California, we work with technology developers on a worldwide basis. Our engineers located in Dublin, California focus on developing sensor hardware, firmware, and perception software.
Our R&D team is responsible for both developing new technology, as well as enhancing the capabilities and performance of our lidar hardware, firmware, and perception software. Our R&D team also has responsibility for identifying, defining, and prototyping advanced components that we may utilize from key suppliers, as well as for our design-for-manufacturability, or DFM, and other critical capabilities. Additionally, this team works alongside our operations team to assist our Tier 1 and contract manufacturer partners as they develop large-scale manufacturing processes based on our lidar design.
Intellectual Property
We believe that our competitive advantage and our success depend in part upon our ability to develop and protect both our intellectual property and our technology. We own a portfolio of intellectual property which includes patents (issued and pending), registered trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and expertise in the development of our lidar solutions.
We have filed patent and trademark applications in order to further secure these rights and strengthen our ability to defend against third parties who may infringe on our rights. We also rely on trade secrets, design and manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations, and licensing and exclusivity opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. Additionally, we protect our proprietary rights through agreements with our commercial partners, vendors, employees, and consultants, as well as close monitoring of the developments, components, products, and competitors in the industry.
As of March 1, 2023, we owned 60 U.S. and foreign issued patents and we had 83 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications, with three patent applications in the drafting stage. In addition, we have two registered and two pending trademark applications. Our patents and patent applications cover a broad range of system level and component level aspects of our key technology including, among other things, bistatic lidar system architecture, laser, scanner, receiver, and perception technology.
Sales and Marketing
We utilize a combination of channel (indirect) sales and direct sales methods. In the Automotive market, we work with Tier 1 partners that are suppliers to OEMs. We intend to license our lidar designs and other intellectual property to these Tier 1 partners, who will then industrialize and sell our technology to their OEM 
customers. While we intend to use Tier 1 partners as our sales channel, we also maintain direct contact with the OEMs, which better enables us to understand their specific product requirements and facilitate the implementation of our product design into their vehicles. Working with Tier 1 partners allows us to use this existing automotive value chain and provides us with an opportunity to increase our penetration of the Automotive market more rapidly than would otherwise be possible. This, in turn, will substantially reduce our investment in sales and marketing, and it will also substantially reduce the associated costs for manufacturing, working capital, validation, and testing, as well as the overhead of product liability and warranty over the life of the multiyear series production programs with OEMs. In the Industrial market, we use the same supply chain to manufacture through global contract manufacturers, and we will sell our products primarily through system integrator channel partners that may integrate our lidar sensor and software as part of a larger solution for an end customer. We also intend to sell directly to certain customers for situations in which a system integrator relationship is either not present or not required.
We solicit feedback directly from partners and customers in order to identify opportunities to improve our product design. Our sales and marketing team works with industry analysts, universities, and independent labs to conduct studies and performance tests, which provides third-party validation of our solutions to current and potential customers and partners. Our marketing team also drives our brand management and increases our public visibility through news releases, advertising campaigns, events, industry panels, and other public relations programs.
Government Regulation
We believe that the U.S. has provided a constructive legal environment to enable the testing and development of autonomous capabilities. We do not expect any federal rules or regulations in the near future that would impact the use or demand for our lidar technology. The states of California and New York, however, do enforce operational or registration requirements for some autonomous functions. U.S. federal regulations generally allow higher levels of safe and responsible autonomous functionality to be deployed. The European Union, China, and other foreign markets are also developing standards to define the requirements for deploying higher levels of autonomy.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, is the principal legal and regulatory authority that has oversight of vehicles equipped with our sensors as they are deployed on public roadways. The obligations of motor vehicle equipment manufacturers include regular reporting under the Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability and Documentation Act, or TREAD, as well as strict recall and reporting requirements for any defects related to highway safety or any non-compliance with the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Similar such reporting and recall requirements exist in foreign markets. As the development of federal, state, and foreign legal frameworks around autonomous vehicles continue to evolve, we may be subject to additional regulatory schemes.
Lidar technology, such as ours, is subject to the Electronic Product Radiation Control Provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. These requirements are enforced by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. Electronic product radiation includes laser technology. Regulations governing these products are intended to protect the public from hazardous or unnecessary exposure. Manufacturers are required to certify in product labeling and reports to the FDA that their products comply with applicable performance standards as well as maintain manufacturing, testing, and distribution records for their products.
We are also subject to import and export regulations of the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. In addition, our operations are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations. We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, as amended, and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety.
Like all companies operating in similar industries, we are subject to environmental regulation, including water use; air emissions; use of recycled materials; energy sources; the storage, handling, treatment, transportation, and disposal of hazardous materials; and the remediation of environmental contamination. Compliance with these rules may include permits, licenses, and inspections of our facilities and products.
Human Capital Resources
We believe that our culture is one of our competitive advantages. We have emphasized a collaborative, team-oriented, performance-based culture with a strong focus on both the development of differentiated technology and the success of our customers. Our leadership team has come from sectors including aerospace and defense, semiconductors, software, computer hardware, management consulting, and private equity. As of December 31, 2022, we had over 160 employees worldwide. The majority of our employees are in the R&D function. We also engage numerous consultants and contractors to supplement our regular full-time workforce. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good. To date, we have not experienced any work stoppages.
Facilities
Our corporate headquarters is located in Dublin, California, where we lease 56,549 square feet pursuant to a lease that expires on December 1, 2026. The Dublin facility contains engineering, R&D, operations, customer support, marketing, and administrative functions. We also lease 10,198 square feet of office space in a facility in Palm Bay, Florida pursuant to a lease which expires on August 14, 2027. The Florida facility contains R&D functions. In addition, we also lease office/building space around the world, primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia. We believe our existing facilities are in good condition and suitable for the conduct of our business.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we may become involved in actions, claims, suits, and other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, including assertions by third parties relating to intellectual property infringement, breaches of contract or warranties, or employment-related matters. We are not currently a party to any actions, claims, suits, or other legal proceedings the outcome of which, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate have a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
Recent Developments 
DGCL 205 Petition
On August 12, 2021, CF Finance Acquisition Corp. III, or the Pre-Merger Company, our predecessor, held a special meeting of stockholders to approve certain matters related to the business combination between the Pre-Merger Company and AEye Technologies, Inc. Among the proposals presented to the Pre-Merger Company stockholders were proposals to (i) adopt a certificate of amendment to the Pre-Merger Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of its Class A Common Stock from 200,000,000 to 300,000,000, or the Authorized Share Amendment, and (ii) amend and restate the charter in connection with the business combination, which included eliminating its Class B Common Stock immediately prior to the closing of the business combination after giving effect to the conversion of each outstanding share of Class B Common Stock into one share of its Class A Common Stock, or the Class B Elimination Amendment. The proposals each received approval from the holders of a majority of the Pre-Merger Company’s outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, voting together as a single class, that were outstanding as of the record date for such special meeting. Following the special meeting, the business combination was closed and the Pre-Merger Company changed its name to "AEye, Inc."
A recent ruling by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or Chancery Court, introduced uncertainty as to whether Section 242(b)(2) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or DGCL, would have required the Authorized Share Amendment to be approved by a separate vote of the majority of the Pre-Merger Company’s then-outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and the Class B Elimination Amendment to be approved by a separate vote of the majority of the Pre-Merger Company’s then-outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock.
Although we received no demands or inquiries from our stockholders regarding the potential uncertainty surrounding our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, or our Charter, which was adopted at the special meeting, and our own analysis determined that a separate class vote to adopt the Charter was not necessary, in light of the recent Chancery Court decision, and to resolve any potential uncertainty with respect to our Charter, or our capital structure, on February 23, 2023, we filed a petition in the Chancery Court under Section 205 of the DGCL, our Section 205 Petition, to seek validation of the Authorized Share Amendment, our Charter, and the shares we issued in reliance thereon. Section 205 permits the Chancery Court, in its discretion, to validate 
potentially defective corporate acts after considering a variety of factors. Concurrently with the filing of our Section 205 Petition, we filed a motion to expedite the hearing, which was granted. The hearing was set for March 14, 2023.
At the March 14, 2023 hearing on our Section 205 Petition, no objections were filed and the court granted our petition. The court order declared our Charter to be valid and effective as of the date and time it was originally filed and that all shares of our capital stock that we have issued in reliance on our Charter were valid as of the date such shares were issued, thereby eliminating any uncertainty with respect to our Charter or any shares we have issued or may issue in the future in reliance thereon.
Silicon Valley Bank Closure
On March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, was appointed as receiver. We have deposit accounts at SVB. The standard deposit insurance amount is up to $250 thousand per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category. As of March 10, 2023, we had approximately $9.6 million in deposit accounts at SVB, of which approximately $2.2 million was held as collateral for letters of credit under our lease agreement. We do not maintain any other material accounts or lines of credit with SVB. On March 12, 2023, the U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve, and FDIC announced that SVB depositors will have access to all of their money starting March 13, 2023. We began the process of withdrawing our deposits from SVB on March 13, 2023.
