Overview
 Viracta Therapeutics, Inc. (“Viracta”) or (the “Company”) is a clinical-stage, precision oncology company focused on the treatment and prevention of virus-associated cancers that impact patients worldwide. The association of viruses and cancer has been well characterized, and Viracta’s lead program is focused on cancers associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (“EBV”). EBV has been recognized as a Group 1 human carcinogen by the World Health Organization (“WHO”). Despite the association of EBV with cancer, there are currently no approved therapies in the United States specifically for EBV-associated cancers and attempts to develop vaccines have not proven successful. EBV enters periods of latency during which most viral genes are epigenetically suppressed. Likewise, the latently infected cell can evade the body’s immune surveillance mechanisms. In some stages of latency, viral proteins are not expressed on the cell surface, making it difficult to develop effective immunotherapies. EBV is estimated to be associated with approximately 2% of the global cancer burden with over 310,000 new cases of EBV-associated lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma (“NPC”) and gastric carcinoma (“GC”) cancers annually, which are responsible for over 180,000 deaths each year. Viracta’s novel Kick and Kill approach targets the EBV genome to enable the killing of the tumor cells by inducing the expression of certain viral kinase genes, which in-turn, activate an antiviral drug. The activated antiviral drug disrupts the DNA replication cycle of the target cells resulting in chain termination and killing of the tumor cells by inducing apoptosis, also known as programmed cell death. This approach may also be applicable to other cancers associated with the herpes family of viruses, to which EBV belongs, such as glioblastoma associated with cytomegalovirus (“CMV”), Kaposi’s sarcoma with Kaposi’s sarcoma virus (“KSV”), and gastrointestinal carcinomas with Human Herpesvirus 6 (“HHV6”).
 Viracta’s lead product candidate is an all-oral combination therapy of its proprietary investigational drug, nanatinostat, and the antiviral agent valganciclovir (collectively referred to as “Nana-val”). Nana-val is currently being evaluated in multiple ongoing clinical trials. In June 2021, Viracta initiated NAVAL-1, a pivotal, global, multicenter, open-label Phase 2 basket trial of Nana-val for the treatment of multiple subtypes of relapsed/refractory (“R/R”) EBV-positive (“EBV+”) lymphoma. In October 2021, the Company

initiated a multinational, open-label Phase 1b/2 trial of Nana-val for the treatment of EBV+ recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (“R/M NPC”) and other EBV+ solid tumors.
Viracta also conducted a Phase 1b/2 trial of Nana-val for the treatment of EBV+ R/R lymphoma, and final results from this trial were presented in an oral presentation at the 63rd American Society of Hematology (“ASH”) Annual Meeting in December 2021. The data demonstrated promising activity in multiple subtypes of heavily pre-treated, R/R EBV+ lymphoma patients, and a generally well-tolerated safety profile. Complete responses were observed in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”), T/NK-cell lymphoma (“T/NK-NHL”), and immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorders (“IA-LPD”). The median duration of response was 10.4 months.
 Viracta has received Fast Track Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) for the treatment of R/R EBV+ lymphoid malignancies. In addition, the FDA has granted orphan drug designations for the treatment of EBV+ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (“EBV+ DLBCL, NOS”), post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (“PTLD”), plasmablastic lymphoma, and T-cell lymphomas. In addition, the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) has granted orphan drug designations for DLBCL and Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma (“PTCL”).
The Viracta team possesses deep, cross-functional experience and a longstanding commitment to developing new medicines to benefit patients. Collectively, the Viracta management team has extensive industry experience in both private and publicly-traded companies, has raised substantial debt and equity capital, conducted significant research and gained expertise on the role of viral biology in cancer, and discovered, developed or launched multiple therapies in oncology and other rare/orphan disease treatments at companies such as Novartis, Genentech, Medivation, MorphoSys, Orchard Therapeutics, PTC Therapeutics, Aegerion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Shire Human Genetic Therapies.
 Merger Transaction between Private Viracta Therapeutics, Inc. and Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Name Change
 On November 29, 2020, the Company, then operating as Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., entered into an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”) with privately-held Viracta Therapeutics, Inc. (“Private Viracta”) and Sol Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”). On February 24, 2021, the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were completed, and Merger Sub merged into Private Viracta, with Private Viracta surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”). Sunesis changed its name to Viracta Therapeutics, Inc. On February 25, 2021, the combined company’s common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “VIRX”.
 Except as otherwise indicated, references herein to “Viracta,” the “Company,” or the “combined company”, refer to Viracta Therapeutics, Inc. on a post-Merger basis, and the term “Private Viracta” refers to the business of privately-held Viracta Therapeutics, Inc., prior to the completion of the Merger. References to “Sunesis” refer to Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. prior to completion of the Merger.
 Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of Private Viracta common stock outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Merger was converted into approximately 0.1119 shares of Company common stock (the “Exchange Ratio”), after taking into account the Reverse Stock Split, as defined below. Immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, all shares of Private Viracta preferred stock then outstanding were exchanged into shares of common stock of Private Viracta. In addition, all outstanding options exercisable for common stock of Private Viracta and warrants exercisable for capital stock of Private Viracta became options and warrants exercisable for the same number of shares of common stock of the Company multiplied by the Exchange Ratio at an exercise price equal to the pre-Merger price divided by the Exchange Ratio. Immediately following the Merger, stockholders of Private Viracta owned approximately 86% of the outstanding common stock of the combined company.
 This transaction was accounted for as a reverse asset acquisition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”), as Viracta was considered to be acquiring Sunesis and the Merger was accounted for as an asset acquisition, even though Sunesis was the legal acquirer and the issuer of the common stock in the Merger. This determination was primarily based on the facts that, immediately following the Merger: (i) Private Viracta’s stockholders owned a substantial majority of the voting rights in the combined company, (ii) Private Viracta designated a majority of the members of the initial board of directors of the combined company, and (iii) Private Viracta’s senior management holds all key positions in the senior management of the combined company. As a result, as of the closing date of the Merger, the net assets of Sunesis were recorded at their acquisition-date relative fair values in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company and the reported operating results prior to the Merger are those of Private Viracta.
 To determine the accounting for this transaction under GAAP, a company must assess whether an integrated set of assets and activities should be accounted for as an acquisition of a business or an asset acquisition. The guidance required an initial screen test to determine if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired was concentrated in a single asset or group of similar assets.

The initial screen test was not met as there was no single asset or group of similar assets for Sunesis that represented a significant majority in this acquisition. However, at the time of the closing of the Merger, Sunesis did not have processes or an organized workforce that significantly contributed to its ability to create outputs, and substantially all of its fair value was concentrated in cash, working capital, and in-process research and development (“IPR&D”). As such, the acquisition was treated as an asset acquisition.
 Concurrent with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Private Viracta entered into an agreement for the sale of common stock in a private placement, which was completed immediately prior to the close of the Merger and resulted in gross proceeds of approximately $65.0 million. In connection with the closing of the Merger and the concurrent private placement of common stock, the holders of the Company’s preferred stock waived their right to exchange their shares into any class of the Company’s stock other than common stock.
 On February 24, 2021, in connection with, and prior to the completion of, the Merger, the Company effected a 3.5-for-one reverse stock split of its then outstanding common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). The par value and the authorized shares of the common stock were not adjusted as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Unless otherwise noted herein, references to share and per-share amounts give retroactive effect to the Reverse Stock Split and the Exchange Ratio which was effected upon the Merger.
 Strategy
 Viracta’s strategy is to build a leading precision oncology company focused on the treatment and prevention of virus-associated cancers that impact patients worldwide. While the association between viruses and cancer has been well characterized, there are currently no FDA approved therapies that specifically target Epstein-Barr virus-harboring cancer cells. Viracta’s lead program targets multiple therapeutic areas of high unmet medical need. Viracta’s current pipeline is derived from its ability to leverage its targeted Kick and Kill mechanism of action across multiple potential tumor types. Viracta prioritizes virus-associated targets that it believes have the potential to change the paradigm of treatment in virus-associated cancers.
 
Key elements of Viracta’s strategy are as follows:
 •Rapidly advance Viracta’s lead product candidate, Nana-val, through clinical development, initially in EBV+ lymphomas;
 •Expand development of Nana-val in other EBV+ malignancies, beginning with solid tumors harboring the EBV genome;
 •Leverage its Kick and Kill approach and evaluate other malignancies associated with other viruses in the herpes family;
 •Evaluate opportunities to combine Nana-val or nanatinostat with other therapeutic modalities; and
 •Evaluate other opportunities to expand Viracta’s pipeline through licensing, acquisitions and/or partnerships.

Scientific Background
 Overview of Virus-associated Malignancies
 The association of viruses and cancer has been well characterized. Despite knowing of EBV’s association with cancer for over half a century, attempts to develop vaccines have not proven successful. The figure below illustrates the association of a number of viruses with various cancers.
Figure 2: Viral Infection and Cancer
 

EBV, a member of the g-herpesvirus family, was the first virus directly implicated in the development of a human tumor and is formally classified as a Group 1 human carcinogen by the WHO. Primary infection with EBV typically occurs in childhood and is generally asymptomatic; however, infection later in life may manifest as infectious mononucleosis. Once infected, individuals remain life-long carriers of the virus, with approximately 95% of the world’s adult population asymptomatically infected with EBV. The EBV genome can be detected in approximately one out of one million circulating B lymphocytes.
 EBV Latency
 EBV enters periods of latency during which most viral genes are epigenetically suppressed, as depicted in the figure below. In some stages, no viral proteins are expressed on the cell surface, making it difficult to develop broadly effective immunotherapies.
 
Figure 3: EBV Latency in Cells
 



Latent infection and intermittent reactivation are two important characteristics of the EBV lifecycle. The maintenance of latent EBV infection requires the expression of a small subset of genes, and specific expression patterns (Types I – III) of these genes are associated with specific EBV-driven malignancies. EBV has been shown to infect B-cells, T-cells, T/NK-cells and epithelial cells, though its greatest predilection is for B-cells. EBV has been associated with a wide spectrum of human malignancies, with B-cell lymphomas being the most common, and include EBV+ diffuse large B cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (“EBV+ DLBCL, NOS”), Burkitt’s lymphoma (“BL”), post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (“PTLD”), and lymphomas associated with congenital and acquired immunodeficiencies, including HIV-related lymphomas.
 Mechanism of Action of Nana-val
 Nana-val utilizes a combination of Viracta’s oral proprietary epigenetic drug, nanatinostat, in combination with the oral antiviral drug valganciclovir. Nanatinostat targets the EBV genome and induces the expression of certain viral kinase genes. Valganciclovir is converted to ganciclovir in the gut, and these EBV kinases then activate ganciclovir, which disrupts the DNA replication cycle, leading to DNA chain termination and killing of the tumor cells by inducing apoptosis. This type of killing can be considered a form of synthetic lethality, where neither drug alone would be as effective in killing the tumor cells, but together the two drugs are lethal to the tumor cells.
 Epigenetic Re-Programming
 EBV gene products can drive aberrant cell proliferation, inhibit programmed cell death and other mechanisms that promote formation of cancer. Viruses and cancers have also evolved mechanisms to evade immune detection by up-regulating immunosuppressive signals, including the induction of PD-L1. Due to these pleiotropic effects, so-called molecularly targeted approaches that target only one oncogenic activity have shown limited ability to impact these cancers.
 Epigenetics refers to mechanisms that control which genes or gene programs are turned on or which ones are silenced. Modification of gene promoter or histones, around which DNA is coiled, are major mechanisms by which gene expression is controlled.
 EBV-Associated Lymphomas
 EBV-associated lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that harbor latent EBV within the tumor cells. Within a specific histologic subtype of lymphoma, the frequency of EBV positivity may vary considerably. EBV is associated with approximately 5% of DLBCL in Western countries and approximately 10%-15% in Asia and South America, whereas approximately 30% of peripheral T cell lymphoma (“PTCL”) and HL within North America are EBV+, and endemic BL are EBV+ in approximately 95% of the cases. The risk for developing an EBV+ lymphoma has been observed to be higher in the setting of immunodeficiency, including in patients with HIV, congenital immunodeficiencies and post-transplant immunosuppression. EBV-related lymphomas express a limited number of viral genes, with latency expression patterns associated with specific lymphoma subtypes. The limited expression of EBV genes may allow for persistence of the viral DNA in cells by restricting the visibility of the virus to the immune system. The observation that lymphomas in patients with impaired immune function are more likely to express a greater number of viral genes is supportive of this concept. EBV-related lymphoproliferative disease in immunosuppressed patients may respond to therapies that improve immune function, such as reduced immunosuppression (e.g., transplant patients) or adoptive immunotherapy. In contrast, EBV-related lymphomas that arise in immunocompetent patients generally express fewer viral genes and proteins, and as a result are less prone to immune attack.


While outcomes vary based on the specific malignancy, EBV-associated lymphomas (e.g., DLBCL, HL, BL, and a number of T-cell lymphomas) often present a treatment challenge as clinical outcomes such as progression free survival and overall survival are worse for some lymphoma subtypes following standard of care regimens as compared to those for EBV-negative patients. The presence of EBV in lymphomas is therefore generally considered to be a poor prognostic indicator. As shown in the figure below, in a series of patients with DLBCL and PTCL, respectively, those who were EBV+ generally presented with more aggressive disease, had lower response rates to first-line therapy, and poorer progression free survival and overall survival. In a meta-analysis evaluating survival outcomes across several lymphoma types (HL, DLBCL, T/NKCL, PTCL), EBV+ disease was associated with significantly worse overall survival.

 EBV-positivity in tumor cells can be detected using in situ hybridization for EBV-encoded RNA (EBER-ISH). This is a clinical laboratory test that detects the presence of EBV in the cancer cell. This test is currently most often used to assist in the diagnosis of lymphoma subtypes. Because there has been a lack of actionable targeted therapies in the past, EBER-ISH has not been routinely used to guide course of treatment.
 The evaluation of EBV utilizing either EBER-ISH and/or LMP-1 immunohistochemistry (“IHC”) in the diagnostic workup of B and T cell lymphomas is included in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (“NCCN”) guidelines. Additionally, protocols established by the College of American Pathologists for both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma include the evaluation of EBV status. These laboratory developed tests are widely available in pathology labs, however the frequency at which the testing is performed varies by treatment center and disease type and is lower in community treatment centers compared to academic institutions. This is likely primarily due to the absence of an available EBV targeted therapy, which impacts the evaluation of treatment options for these patients.
 Antivirals, including acyclovir and ganciclovir, are prodrugs that are specifically activated by herpesvirus kinases, such as thymidine kinase (“TK”) and protein kinase (“PK”). These viral kinases are strictly expressed in the lytic phase of the viral life but not in the latent phase, which is the predominant phase in EBV associated tumors. To overcome this barrier, Viracta utilizes its proprietary epigenetic drug candidate, nanatinostat, to induce the expression of these viral kinase genes. Once induced, the viral kinases phosphorylate and activate the antiviral prodrug in the tumor cell, resulting in the killing of the tumor cell. Viracta has determined that for EBV-associated malignancies, oral valganciclovir, which is converted to ganciclovir in the gut, is its preferred antiviral drug.
 Nanatinostat belongs to a class of drugs known as histone deacetylase (“HDAC”) inhibitors. HDAC inhibitors have been explored as anti-tumor agents. They were shown to have, in general, limited activity and in general, the efficacy they did exhibit was compromised by their adverse event profile. Nanatinostat is a highly potent class I HDAC inhibitor, specifically targeting those few HDAC isozymes required for silencing of EBV gene expression in tumors. Viracta has evaluated nanatinostat doses approximately 20-25% of the maximally tolerated dose (as determined in a previous Phase 1 study) to re-activate the latent EBV gene expression; the combination of nanatinostat with valganciclovir has thus far demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile in a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in patients with recurrent EBV+ lymphoma.
 HDAC Enzymes and Inhibitors


Currently, 18 HDAC enzymes have been identified in mammalian cells, varying in function, localization, and substrates. They are subdivided into four main classes based on homology to yeast proteins. Three of the four classes (Classes I, II, and IV) are zinc (“Zn2+”) dependent enzymes and are inhibited by the pan-HDAC inhibitors.
 Epigenetic modulation of gene expression is an essential biological process, with chromatin structure and gene transcription tightly regulated by the acetylation state of histones in the nucleosome. Histone acetylation is a balance of the actions of histone acetyltransferases (“HATs”) and HDACs, with acetylation of histones generally associated with induction of gene transcription and deacetylation with decreases in transcription. Though a seemingly simple concept, it belies the complexity of the effects of HDAC inhibition on chromatin structure. Exposure to HDAC inhibitors rapidly leads to compensating changes in histone methylation and changes in expression of histone modulators. In tumor cells, the most commonly reported effects of HDAC inhibitors relate to induction of apoptosis, though they have also been shown to interfere with cell growth and differentiation and inhibit angiogenesis. In addition, HDAC inhibitors have been shown to modulate immune responses which, in turn, affect many diverse cellular functions.
To date, more than 15 HDAC inhibitors have been tested in nonclinical and clinical studies. HDAC inhibitors are broadly classified into four main groups based on their structure: hydroxamic acids, cyclic peptides/depsipeptides, benzamides, and short-chain fatty acids. A common mechanism of action of these drugs is to bind a critical Zn2+ ion required for catalytic function of the HDAC enzyme.
 Several HDAC inhibitors have demonstrated clinical antitumor activity when dosed at or near the maximum tolerated dose, with three currently marketed in the U.S. for relapsed/refractory oncology indications. These are vorinostat for the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma, romidepsin for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and belinostat for the treatment of peripheral T-cell lymphoma.
 Common side effects seen with these HDAC inhibitors include thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, fatigue and diarrhea. While HDAC inhibitors have displayed some antitumor activity as single agents, data suggest that the HDAC inhibitors may have a greater role as part of combination regimens.
 Rationale for the Combination of HDAC Inhibitors and Antivirals for the Treatment of EBV-Associated Lymphomas
Induction of virus-encoded kinases within EBV+ lymphomas results in the sensitization of tumor cells to the antiviral agent ganciclovir, a prodrug that is modified and activated by the EBV kinases. The modified ganciclovir serves as a nucleotide analog that blocks the process of DNA synthesis leading to tumor cell death. We believe this approach is likely to have high tumor specificity as only EBV containing tumor cells would be targeted by the activated ganciclovir. The potential for this approach was initially demonstrated in a transplant patient who had developed an EBV+ immunoblastic lymphoma four months after transplantation. In a cell line derived from the patient’s tumor, treatment with arginine butyrate, a pan-HDAC inhibitor, induced expression of EBV lytic phase proteins, which include the viral enzymes that modify ganciclovir, and resulted in halting cell proliferation and reduction in cell viability. Arginine butyrate was added to the patient’s existing treatment with ganciclovir with no apparent additional toxicity. Though the patient succumbed to a systemic Aspergillus infection that had preceded arginine butyrate therapy, subsequent pathologic examination of the tumor showed substantial necrosis compared to pre-therapy histology. However, a definitive causal relationship between arginine butyrate/ganciclovir therapy and antitumor effect was confounded by prior treatment with chemotherapy.
 Additional clinical support was demonstrated in a Phase 1/2 investigator sponsored trial that combined the HDAC inhibitor arginine butyrate with intravenous ganciclovir in 15 patients with recurrent EBV+ lymphomas. Arginine butyrate was administered as a continuous intravenous infusion daily on an escalating dose schedule within each patient for 21 days of a 28-day treatment course, combined with a fixed daily dose of ganciclovir that was not interrupted. Eleven patients received at least one full cycle of therapy, and all 15 patients were evaluable for response. Antitumor activity was reported in 10 patients, with 4 complete responses and 6 partial responses.
 Development Programs
 Viracta’s Combination Approach
 The use of Nana-val is a novel therapeutic approach to target EBV+ malignancies, using a low-dose of Viracta’s oral proprietary epigenetic drug, nanatinostat, to target the EBV genome and induce the expression of certain viral kinase genes. These viral genes then activate the antiviral prodrug, valganciclovir, which is converted to ganciclovir in the gut, and disrupts the DNA replication cycle. This disruption then leads to chain termination and killing of the tumor cells by inducing apoptosis. This type of killing can be considered a form of synthetic lethality, where neither drug alone would be as effective in killing the tumor cells, but together the two drugs are lethal to the tumor cells.


Nanatinostat is a hydroxamic acid-based Class 1 HDAC inhibitor and is a more than 2,000 times more potent inducer of the latent EBV genes targeted by this approach than arginine butyrate, the first generation HDAC inhibitor previously investigated in an academic setting. Additionally, the class specificity of nanatinostat is critical for both the targeted efficacy and safety of the approach. As a class, HDACs control the acetylation status of a range of histone and non-histone proteins, giving these enzymes a key role in a number of vital cellular processes. HDAC inhibition alters gene expression at many levels, including gene transcription, protein expression, and signal transduction pathways. Cellular effects include control of the cell cycle, cell differentiation and senescence, inflammation, angiogenesis and apoptosis. Nanatinostat has demonstrated pleiotropic activity both in vitro and in vivo across a range of human cancers in nonclinical studies.
 Nanatinostat was initially evaluated as a single agent in a Phase 1 clinical trial at oral doses ranging from 5 to 160 mg daily in 39 patients with advanced solid tumors. The maximum tolerated dose (“MTD”) of nanatinostat was 80 mg daily, and the recommended Phase 2 dose was determined to be 40 mg daily. This program was beneficial in establishing the early safety and tolerability profiles of nanatinostat before it was acquired by Viracta from Chroma Therapeutics in 2016 for the development of Nana-val.
 Nanatinostat induces the expression of EBV kinase genes to activate ganciclovir, rather than acting directly as a cytotoxic agent. In clinical trials, nanatinostat at doses below 40 mg daily in combination with valganciclovir has demonstrated clinical activity in patients with recurrent EBV+ lymphomas. In the concluded Phase 1b/2 trial, 35 patients with R/R EBV+ lymphomas received the recommended Phase 2 dose regimen of nanatinostat (20 mg p.o. (orally) daily (“QD”) for four days/week, i.e., 4 days on, 3 days off), with valganciclovir 900 mg p.o. daily. The combination was generally well-tolerated in the trial with the most common grade 3/4 adverse events being reversible cytopenias.
 Nana-val in Relapsed/Refractory EBV+ Lymphoma
 Phase 1b/2 Clinical Trial in Relapsed/Refractory EBV+ Lymphomas
 In 2018, Viracta initiated a Phase 1b/2 dose escalation and expansion trial to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy and define a recommended Phase 2 dose (“RP2D”) of Nana-val in patients with relapsed/refractory EBV+ lymphomas who had received one or more prior therapies and had exhausted standard therapies. Patients were enrolled from approximately 20 centers in the US and 6 centers in Brazil.
 Figure 5: Design of Phase 1b/2 Trial in R/R EBV+ Lymphomas
 

Twenty-five patients were enrolled in the Phase 1b portion of the trial, and the RP2D was determined to be nanatinostat 20 mg p.o. daily for four days/week, i.e., 4 days on, 3 days off, with valganciclovir 900 mg p.o. daily. Thirty patients were enrolled in a Phase 2 expansion arm. In December 2021, the final results of the Phase 1b/2 study were presented at the ASH congress. Nana-val was generally well-tolerated and demonstrated promising activity in multiple lymphoma subtypes, with complete responses in DLBCL, T/NK-NHL, and IA-LPD, and a median duration of response of 10.4 months.
 In 55 patients evaluable for safety, the most common grade 3/4 adverse events were reversible cytopenias (Figure 7). Serious adverse events (“SAEs”) occurred in 16 patients (29%); SAEs occurring in ≥2 patients were febrile neutropenia and pneumonia (both n=2). No study drug related deaths occurred in the treatment period.

NAVAL-1
 An Open-Label, Phase 2 Trial of Nanatinostat in Combination With Valganciclovir in Patients With Epstein-Barr Virus-Positive (“EBV+”) Relapsed/Refractory Lymphomas
 In June 2021, Viracta initiated NAVAL-1, a global, multicenter, open-label Phase 2 basket trial utilizing a Simon 2-stage design that will evaluate the combination of nanatinostat with valganciclovir in patients with R/R EBV+ lymphoma. Lymphoma subtypes demonstrating promising activity may be further expanded to assess potential support of future new drug application filings. NAVAL-1 is anticipated to enroll approximately 140 patients at centers in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. The primary endpoint of the trial is objective response rate, with key secondary endpoints including duration of response, survival outcomes, and the safety profile of the combined treatment. Patients with EBV+ R/R disease following two or more prior therapies (one or more for extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma and PTCL) without curative treatment options will be eligible for enrollment.
Nana-val in EBV+ Solid Tumors
An Open-Label, Multicenter Phase 1b/2 Study of Nanatinostat and Valganciclovir in Patients with Advanced Epstein-Barr Virus-Positive (“EBV+”) Solid Tumors and in Combination with Pembrolizumab in Patients with Recurrent/Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
 Viracta is also evaluating Nana-val in solid tumors, having received FDA clearance of an IND in July of 2021 for a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in patients with EBV+ solid tumors. In October 2021, Viracta initiated a multinational Phase 1b/2 trial in patients with EBV+ recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (“R/M NPC”) and other EBV+ solid tumors. The trial is designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of Nana-val alone and in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab (Keytruda). The Phase 1b dose escalation portion is designed to determine the recommended RP2D of Nana-val in patients with EBV+ R/M NPC. In January

2023, Viracta announced it had observed its first clinical response in the third dose level of the Phase 1b dose escalation study. Viracta plans to select its RP2D in 2023. In Phase 2, up to sixty patients with EBV+ R/M NPC will be randomized to receive Nana-val at the RP2D with or without pembrolizumab, to evaluate safety, overall response rate, and potential pharmacodynamic markers. Additionally, patients with other EBV+ solid tumors will be enrolled to receive Nana-val at the RP2D in a Phase 1b dose expansion cohort. Both the Phase 2 study and the Phase 1b dose expansion cohort are anticipated to be initiated in the second half of 2023.
 Preliminary safety data from the first 3 dose levels (10 patients) demonstrated no dose limiting toxicities. Related adverse events were all mild-moderate in nature, most commonly fatigue, nausea, and increased creatinine. Dose escalation in phase 1b is ongoing.
 The global annual incidence of NPC and GC is estimated to be approximately 100,000 cases for each of the two malignancy types. Although some treatment options are available, there remains a high unmet need, particularly in patients with relapsed/refractory disease.
 As shown in the figure below, the combination of the class I HDAC inhibitor romidepsin with ganciclovir in human tumor murine xenograft mouse models of EBV+ NPC and GC has demonstrated a greater effect upon tumor growth than the administration of either agent alone, providing the nonclinical proof of concept for combining an HDAC inhibitor with an antiviral agent in solid tumors. High tumor uptake of nanatinostat has been demonstrated in murine xenograft mouse models of colorectal cancer.

 About Vecabrutinib
 Vecabrutinib is a well-tolerated, selective, reversible, non-covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (“BTK”) and interleukin-2-inducible kinase (“ITK”). In December 2021, new preclinical data on vecabrutinib was presented in oral and poster presentations at the 2021 American Society of Hematology (“ASH”) Annual Meeting. The oral presentation featured preclinical data indicating that vecabrutinib may enhance the efficacy and safety of CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T (“CART19”) cell therapy. Though CART19 cell therapy has been shown to effectively treat certain hematological malignancies, rates of long-term durable response after therapy are low and the majority of patients develop resistance. Additionally, CAR T-cell therapies are associated with significant safety concerns such as cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity. Viracta is evaluating future development and collaboration opportunities for vecabrutinib in combination with CAR T-cell therapies.
 About VRx-510 (formerly SNS-510)
 VRx-510 is a preclinical-stage PDK-1 inhibitor. Viracta is evaluating future development and collaboration opportunities for VRx-510 in multiple oncology indications.
 Other Preclinical Programs


In addition to current studies aimed at assessing the efficacy of the nanatinostat/valganciclovir modality in treatment of EBV-linked malignancies, Viracta is also investigating in pre-clinical studies the use of its proprietary epigenetic drug candidate, nanatinostat, and its potential therapeutic application in other virus-associated malignancies (e.g., HPV) and EBV-associated diseases.
License Agreements
 Boston University License Agreement
 In October 2007, Viracta entered into a license agreement with Trustees of Boston University (“Boston University”), pursuant to which Boston University granted Viracta an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize certain product candidates for blood disorders (the “Original BU License Agreement”). In connection with the Original BU License agreement, Viracta sold to Boston University 100 shares of special preferred stock and 12,448 shares of Viracta Common Stock (all pre-merger share values).
 Between 2009 and 2012, Viracta and Boston University entered into a series of amendments to the Original BU License Agreement, and in August 2018, the parties entered into an amended and restated license agreement, which amended and restated all prior agreements between the parties and superseded all prior agreements and amendments (the “Restated BU License Agreement”). Under the Restated BU License Agreement, Boston University granted Viracta an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license to Boston University’s patent and other related technology rights to develop and commercialize certain product candidates for the treatment of viral or virally induced conditions, including but not limited to nanatinostat in combination with valganciclovir for the treatment of EBV-associated malignancies. Viracta’s obligations under the Restated BU License Agreement include, among other things, using commercially reasonable efforts to bring at least one licensed product to market in the United States and using commercially reasonable efforts to continue development and marketing.
 Pursuant to the Restated BU License Agreement, Viracta is required to pay royalties to Boston University ranging from the low single digits as a percentage of net sales for products covered by the licensed patent rights and royalties of less than one percent on net sales for product covered by or developed using the licensed technology. For each year during the term of the Restated BU License Agreement, Viracta is required to pay Boston University an annual minimum royalty of $30,000. In addition, Viracta is required to pay a percentage of certain payments received from sublicensees of the license granted by Boston University, ranging from mid-teens to low single digits as a percentage of the respective payments.
 Unless earlier terminated as provided for in the Restated BU License Agreement, the agreement will remain in effect on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until Viracta’s royalty obligations expire. Boston University has certain termination rights in the circumstances of uncured material breach by Viracta, Viracta’s insolvency or a challenge of Boston University’s patent rights by Viracta.
 In August 2018, in connection with the execution of the Restated BU License Agreement, Viracta and Boston University agreed to exchange all 100 shares of special preferred stock for 1,679,186 shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock (all pre-merger share values). In connection with the Merger, all of the outstanding shares of Private Viracta's convertible preferred stock were converted into shares of the Company's common stock.
ImmunityBio License Agreement
 In May 2017, Viracta entered into a license agreement with ImmunityBio, Inc., formerly NantKwest, Inc. (“ImmunityBio”), which was amended by the parties in November 2018 (as amended, the “NK License Agreement”). Pursuant to the NK License Agreement, Viracta granted an exclusive worldwide license to ImmunityBio and its affiliates to develop and commercialize nanatinostat for use in combination with natural killer cell immunotherapies (“NK Covered Products”).
 Under the NK License Agreement, Viracta is eligible to receive up to a total of $100.0 million in regulatory and commercial milestone payments upon the occurrence of certain milestone events. Viracta is also eligible to earn tiered royalties as a percentage of net sales of licensed NK Covered Products, ranging from the low to mid-single digits.
 ImmunityBio is responsible for conducting all necessary studies, including safety studies and clinical trials necessary in connection with seeking regulatory approvals to market NK Covered Products under the NK License Agreement in any territory.
 Unless earlier terminated, the NK License Agreement will continue until the expiration of all applicable royalty terms on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis. Both parties have certain termination rights in the circumstances of an uncured material breach by or insolvency of the other party. ImmunityBio has the right to terminate the NK License Agreement in whole or on a product-by-product and/or country-by-country basis without cause upon 90 days prior written notice to Viracta.


Shenzhen Salubris Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd. License Agreement
 In November 2018, Viracta entered into a License Agreement with Shenzhen Salubris Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., (“Salubris”), pursuant to which the Company granted an exclusive, royalty-bearing license, with the right to grant sublicenses to Salubris to research, develop, use, make, have made, sell, offer for sale, have sold, import, and otherwise commercialize nanatinostat in combination with an antiviral drug such as valganciclovir in the Republic of China, excluding Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.
In August 2021, Viracta, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Viracta Subsidiary, Inc., entered into a Mutual Termination Agreement with Salubris (the “Termination Agreement”), pursuant to which the parties agreed to terminate the exclusive collaboration and license agreement entered into by the parties in November 2018. Under the terms of the Termination Agreement, the Company paid Salubris a payment in the amount of $4.0 million on the effective date of the Termination Agreement, and all licenses granted by the Company to Salubris automatically terminated.
Manufacturing
 Viracta uses third party contract labs and facilities for the manufacture and testing of drug substance, drug product, and clinical trial material while providing internal oversight on technical development, quality and regulatory compliance. This outsourcing model allows Viracta to maintain a flexible infrastructure and capital efficiency while focusing its expertise on developing its products.
Viracta expects to continue to rely on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any product candidates. There are no complicated biochemistries or unusual equipment required in the manufacturing process for either nanatinostat or valganciclovir.
 Viracta has established a quality control and quality assurance program, which includes a set of standard operating procedures and specifications designed to ensure that Viracta’s products are manufactured in accordance with cGMPs, and other applicable domestic and foreign regulations.
 Competition
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapid technological advancement technologies, significant competition and an emphasis on intellectual property. Although Viracta believes that its technology, the expertise of its executive and scientific team, research, clinical capabilities, development experience and scientific knowledge provide it with competitive advantages, Viracta faces increasing competition from many different sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Product candidates that Viracta successfully develops and commercializes may be required to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future to be successful.
 Many of Viracta’s competitors, either alone or with their collaborators, have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market, expertise in research and development, manufacturing, nonclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement and marketing approved products than Viracta does. These competitors also compete with Viracta in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, Viracta’s programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Additional mergers and acquisitions may result in even more resources being concentrated in Viracta’s competitors.
 Viracta’s commercial potential could be reduced or eliminated if its competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than products that Viracta may develop. Viracta’s competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than Viracta may obtain approval for its products, which could result in Viracta’s competitors establishing a strong market position before Viracta is able to enter the market or make Viracta’s product development more complicated. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of Viracta’s programs are likely to be efficacy, safety, convenience, cost, level or promotional activity devoted to them and intellectual property protection.
 For Nana-val, Viracta’s proprietary HDAC inhibitor, nanatinostat, in combination with valganciclovir, Viracta is aware of several other approved and clinical-stage HDAC inhibitors being developed by competitors. To Viracta’s knowledge, there are no HDAC inhibitors approved for the treatment of EBV+ lymphoma. However, there are several marketed products and product candidates in development for the treatment of various lymphoma types that do not consider the EBV status of the patients. Some marketed products and therapies are used in the treatment of lymphomas, including EBV+ lymphomas. In addition, a number of companies and

academic institutions are developing drug candidates for EBV-associated PTLD and other EBV-associated diseases including: Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc., which recently obtained regulatory marking approval in the EU for Tab‐cel® (tabelecleucel), a product for virus-associated EBV+ PTLD. AlloVir, which is conducting clinical trials for Viralym-M (“ALVR105”), its allogeneic, multi-virus T-cell product that targets six viruses including EBV, is planning to initiate several Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials for the treatment of various viruses, including EBV. Tessa Therapeutics, which has an allogeneic CD30-Chimeric Antigen Receptor (“CAR”) EBV-specific T cells (“EBVSTs”) for CD30 positive lymphomas in Phase 1, and multiple companies are investigating the use of anti-PD1/PD-L1 antibodies for the treatment of EBV-associated malignancies.
 Intellectual property
Viracta endeavors to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to its business, including seeking, maintaining and defending its patent rights. Viracta owns and licenses issued patents and patent applications relating to its lead product candidate Nana-val, as well as its other product candidates. Viracta’s policy is to seek to protect its proprietary position by, among other methods, filing patent applications in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States directed to its proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of its business. Viracta also relies on trade secrets and know-how relating to its proprietary technology and product candidates and continuing innovation to develop, strengthen and maintain its proprietary position in the field of oncology. Viracta also plans to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions when available. Viracta’s commercial success will depend in part on its ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for its technology, inventions and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of its trade secrets; to defend and enforce its proprietary rights, including any patents that it may own or license in the future; and to operate without infringing on the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.
 As of December 31, 2022, Viracta’s patent portfolio consisted of issued patents and pending patent applications that Viracta owns or licenses related to its Nana-val product candidate and various other compounds and programs. With respect to the programs directed to virus-associated malignancies and other diseases. Viracta owns or licenses four issued U.S. patents, and approximately eleven pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications and approximately 62 pending foreign patent applications and issued foreign patents, two of which are international patent applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT application”) and seven of which are European regional patent applications.
 More specifically with respect to Nana-val, Viracta owns one issued U.S. patent in its owned portfolio described above that has claims directed to nanatinostat as a composition of matter, as well as claims directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising nanatinostat. This U.S. patent is expected to expire in January 2027, absent any patent term extensions for regulatory delay. In addition, and specifically with respect to Nana-val, Viracta licenses one issued U.S. patent in its portfolio described above that has claims directed to methods of treatment with Nana-val for the treatment of viral or virally-induced conditions caused by a DNA virus, including EBV. This U.S. patent is expected to expire in March 2031, absent any patent term extensions for regulatory delay. Viracta owns an additional patent related to the dosing schedule for Nana-val for the treatment of lymphoid malignancies that will expire in May 2040, again absent any patent term extensions for regulatory delay.
 Viracta also possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of its product candidates, including related manufacturing processes and technology.
 With respect to its product candidates and processes it intends to develop and commercialize in the normal course of business, Viracta intends to pursue patent protection covering, when possible, compositions, methods of use, dosing and formulations. Viracta may also pursue patent protection with respect to manufacturing and drug development processes and technologies.
 Issued patents can provide protection for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In general, patents issued for applications filed in the United States can provide exclusionary rights for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In addition, in certain instances, the term of an issued U.S. patent that covers or claims an FDA approved product can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, which is called patent term extension. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The term of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with the laws of the foreign jurisdiction, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.


The patent positions of companies like Viracta’s are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of oncology has emerged in the United States. The relevant patent laws and their interpretation outside of the United States is also uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish Viracta’s ability to protect its technology or product candidates and could affect the value of such intellectual property. In particular, Viracta’s ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing products that infringe its intellectual property will depend in part on Viracta’s success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover Viracta’s technology, inventions and improvements. Viracta cannot guarantee that patents will be granted with respect to any of its pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications it may file in the future, nor can Viracta be sure that any patents that may be granted to it in the future will be commercially useful in protecting its products, the methods of use or manufacture of those products. Moreover, even Viracta’s issued patents may not guarantee it the right to practice its technology in relation to the commercialization of its product candidates and products. Patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology space are evolving and involve many risks and uncertainties. For example, third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent Viracta from commercializing its product and practicing its proprietary technology, and Viracta’s issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit its ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or could limit the term of patent protection that otherwise may exist for Viracta’s product candidates. In addition, the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide Viracta with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, Viracta’s competitors may independently develop similar technologies that are outside the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents. For these reasons, Viracta may face competition with respect to its product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any patent protection for such product may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides.
 Government regulation
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
 U.S. drug development
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”) and its implementing regulations. FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. Drugs also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources, and the expenditure of such resources does not assure that regulatory approval will ultimately be obtained. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-marketing may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, voluntary or mandatory product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal fines or penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on Viracta, market acceptance of Viracta’s products, and Viracta’s reputation.
 Viracta’s product candidates are considered small molecule drugs and must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application (“NDA”) process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following:
•completion of nonclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice (“GLP”) requirements and International Council for Harmonization (“ICH”);
 •submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (“IND”), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
 •approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;


•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice (“GCP”) requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
 •submission to the FDA of an NDA;
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept the filing for review;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
 •potential FDA audit of the Sponsor company, contract research organizations, and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA filing;
 •payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA;
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States; and
 •compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), a Risk Management Plan and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
 The data required to support an NDA are generated in two distinct developmental stages: preclinical and clinical, both of which may include non-clinical (animal) studies. The preclinical and clinical testing and approval processes require substantial time, effort and financial resources, and Viracta cannot be certain that any approvals for any current and future product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.
 Preclinical studies and IND submission
 Before testing any drug product candidate in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP and ICH regulations for safety/toxicology studies. The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, among other things, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and transport investigational drug across state lines and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials, which are generally required for FDA approval of an NDA, to commence. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development along with any subsequent changes to the investigational plan. Some long-term nonclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 Pediatric Information
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data.
 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity—patent or non-patent—for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.


Clinical trials
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which are designed to protect the rights, integrity, and confidentiality of research subjects and include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries, including the website maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, ClinicalTrials.gov.
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA. The FDA will generally accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with GCP and ICH requirements and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection, if deemed necessary, and the practice of medicine in the foreign country is consistent with the United States.
 Clinical trials in the United States generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, that may overlap or be combined in certain circumstances.
 •Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, tolerability and safety of the drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
 •Phase 2 clinical trials generally involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose and dosing schedule required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified, and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.
 •Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the product for its intended use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product to provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of confirmatory clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. The sponsor is also responsible for submitting written IND safety reports, including reports of serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, and any clinically significant increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
 Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or steering committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check-points based on access to certain data from the trial.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal safety studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in

commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process, as performed by the manufacturing facility, must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of Viracta’s product candidates. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that Viracta’s product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their labeled shelf life.
 NDA review process
 Following completion of the clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of nonclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information in a request for approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications.
 The application must include both negative and ambiguous results of nonclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of FDA. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be legally marketed in the United States.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by an application user fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for each marketed human drug. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a qualifying small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
 The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs before it accepts them for filing to determine if they are sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, and the FDA may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular-entity NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular-entity NDA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA also closely analyzes the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies and/or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than Viracta interprets the same data.
 Orphan drugs
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.


Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. However, competitors may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of Viracta’s products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before Viracta does for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication Viracta is seeking approval, or if a product candidate is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication. If one of Viracta’s products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.
 Expedited development and review programs
 The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for fast track status any time before receiving NDA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-NDA meeting with the FDA.
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies.
 A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval, if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (“IMM”), which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA generally requires that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. FDA may withdraw drug approval or require changes to the labeled indication of the drug if confirmatory post-marketing trials fail to verify clinical benefit or do not demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit to justify the risks associated with the drug. If the FDA concludes that a drug shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it may require such post-marketing restrictions as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product.
 Additionally, a drug may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate a substantial improvement over currently available therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. Fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. However, all promotional materials for products receiving such accelerated approval must be precleared by FDA’s Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (“OPDP”).
Post-approval requirements
Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to facility registration and drug listing, monitoring and record-keeping requirements, adverse event and other periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and product promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations, known as “off-label use,” and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion

of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the development of additional manufacturing data or nonclinical studies and clinical trials.
 The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes that a REMS is needed, the NDA sponsor must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
 FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations. Manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation, and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, its manufacturer or the NDA holder, including recalls.
 The FDA may withdraw approval of a product if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Corrective action could delay drug distribution and require significant time and financial expenditures. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-marketing studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 •restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls;
 •fines, warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;
 •suspension or revocation of product approvals;
 •product seizure or detention;
 •refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 FDA regulation of companion diagnostics
Safe and effective use of a drug may rely upon an in vitro companion diagnostic for use in selecting the patients that will be more likely to respond to that therapy. FDA officials have issued guidance that addresses issues critical to developing in vitro companion diagnostics, such as when the FDA will require that the diagnostic and the drug be approved simultaneously. The guidance issued in August 2014 states that if safe and effective use of a therapeutic product depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product.
 The FDA requires that devices, or in vitro companion diagnostics, intended to select the patients who will respond to the treatment to obtain premarket approval, 510(k) clearance, or authorization of a De Novo application, depending on the level of risk presented by the companion diagnostic together with available controls to mitigate the risk. Based on the guidance, and the FDA’s past treatment of companion diagnostics, the FDA may require premarket approval, 510(k) clearance, or authorization of a De Novo application of one or more in vitro companion diagnostics to identify patient populations suitable for Viracta’s therapeutic drug candidates. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of Viracta’s therapeutic drug candidates involves coordination

of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, and by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, or CDRH, Office of In Vitro Diagnostics Device Evaluation and Safety.
 The premarket approval, or PMA, process, including the gathering of clinical and manufacturing data and the submission to and review by the FDA involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are also subject to an application fee.
 To obtain 510(k) clearance, a pre-market notification is submitted to the FDA demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, which is a previously-cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet required the submission of a PMA application. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process is subject to an application fee and may take more than 12 months from the date the application is submitted and filed with the FDA, but may take longer if FDA requests additional information, among other reasons. In some cases, the FDA may require clinical data to support substantial equivalence. In reviewing a 510(k) clearance application, the FDA may request additional information, which may significantly prolong the review process. Notwithstanding compliance with all these requirements, clearance is never assured.
 If a new medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) clearance process because no predicate device to which it is substantially equivalent can be identified, the device must submit a PMA application unless the device is eligible for De Novo authorization. The De Novo process allows a manufacturer whose novel device would otherwise require premarket approval to request a risk-based assessment of its medical device to determine whether regulatory controls mitigate the risks of the device to provide a reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness. The FDA may reject the De Novo application if the FDA identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk and requires PMA or that adequate controls cannot be developed to mitigate the device’s risks.
 Obtaining FDA premarket approval, 510(k) clearance, or De Novo authorization for medical devices is expensive and uncertain, and may take several years, and generally requires significant scientific and clinical data.
 After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Among other requirements, medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved, device manufacturers must establish registration and device listings with the FDA and a medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA and the FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the U.S.
 Other U.S. regulatory matters
Viracta’s current and future arrangements with healthcare providers, third-party payors, customers, and others may expose Viracta to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which may affect the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which Viracta researches, sells, markets, and distributes any products for which Viracta obtains marketing approval. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that may affect Viracta ability to operate include, but are not limited to:
 •the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug or medical device manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim for health care items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act;
 •the federal criminal False Claims Act and Civil Monetary Penalties Laws, and the civil False Claims Act, which can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government, and/or impose exclusions from federal health care programs and/or penalties for parties who engage in such prohibited conduct;


•the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), prohibits, among other things, executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
 •HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their implementing regulations, also imposes obligations including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
 •federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;
 •the FD&C Act, which prohibits, among other things, the adulteration or misbranding of drugs, biologics and medical devices;
 •the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) information regarding payments and other transfers of value to physicians, teaching hospitals, and other healthcare professionals as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
 •analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, state laws that require biotechnology companies to comply with the biotechnology industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and require the registration of their sales representatives, state laws that require biotechnology companies to report information on the pricing of certain drug products, and state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Pricing and rebate programs must also comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”). If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. In addition, the distribution of pharmaceutical and/or medical device products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical and/or medical device products. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act as well as other applicable consumer safety requirements.
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participating in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.
 U.S. patent-term restoration and marketing exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of any future product candidates, some of Viracta’s U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, Viracta may apply for restoration of

patent term for its currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
Market exclusivity provisions under the FD&C Act also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FD&C Act provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for a generic version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FD&C Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical studies, chemistry, manufacturing and controls data and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness or generate such data themselves.
 European Union drug development
Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research (including any non-clinical research) in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated, it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority (“NCA”), and one or more Ethics Committees (“ECs”). Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
The EU clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical-trial authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. Recently enacted Clinical Trials Regulation EU No 536/2014 ensures that the rules for conducting clinical trials in the EU will be identical. In the meantime, Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC continues to govern all clinical trials performed in the EU.
 European Union drug review and approval
 In the European Economic Area (“EEA”), which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union and three European Free Trade Association States (Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (“MA”). There are two types of marketing authorizations.
 •The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”), of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.
 •National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the European Union, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (“RMS”). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft 


summary of the product characteristics (“SPC”), and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).
 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Union make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. Similar to the U.S. patent term-restoration, Supplementary Protection Certificates (“SPCs”) serve as an extension to a patent right in Europe for up to five years. SPCs apply to specific pharmaceutical products to offset the loss of patent protection due to the lengthy testing and clinical trials these products require prior to obtaining regulatory marketing approval.
 Coverage and reimbursement
Sales of Viracta’s products will depend, in part, on the extent to which its products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. There is significant uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, for example, principal decisions about reimbursement of new products are typically made by CMS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private third-party payors often follow CMS’s decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement to a substantial degree. However, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of Viracta’s products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis.
Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Further, such payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of medical product candidates. There may be especially significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific product candidates on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Viracta may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of its products. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require Viracta to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of its products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of Viracta placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of Viracta’s products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
 Healthcare reform
The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, in March 2010, the ACA, was passed which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the HHS Secretary as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price (“AMP”), to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded

the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. Additionally, for a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer.
 Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial, Congressional and executive branch challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare Part D drug plans. In December 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA-qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. Although Viracta is aware of no pending constitutional challenges to the ACA, there is no certainty that further legal challenges will not be brought nor can there be any certainty of their outcome.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, effective April 1, 2013, which, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for Viracta’s products, if approved, and accordingly, Viracta’s financial operations.
 Additionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, at the federal level, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out-of-pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out-of-pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. Additionally, on November 20, 2020, HHS Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) issued a final rule eliminating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors for rebates paid by manufactures to Medicare Part D plan sponsors, Medicaid managed care organizations, and those entities’ pharmacy benefit managers, the purpose of which is to further reduce the cost of drug products to consumers. The OIG created two new safe harbors for certain point-of-sale reductions in price on prescription pharmaceutical products and certain pharmacy benefit manager service fees. On December 2, 2020, OIG and CMS each issued a final rule that set forth modifications to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, Civil Monetary Penalties Law and Physician Self-Referral Law (or the Stark Law) (respectively) regulations to remove regulatory barriers to value-based care arrangements. CMS’s final rule also clarifies and updates certain long-standing terms that appear throughout the Stark Law regulations. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”), established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which Viracta receives marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for Viracta’s products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices Viracta might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private third-party payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. In addition, in September 2020, President Trump signed an executive order entitled “Lowering Drug Prices by Putting America First” (the “MFN Executive Order”). The MFN Executive Order provides that it is “the policy of the United States that the Medicare program should not pay more for costly Part B or Part D prescription drugs or biological products than the most-favored-nation price” within the member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (the “MFN Price”); and directs the Secretary of the HHS to implement rulemaking to test a payment model pursuant to which Medicare would pay no more than the MFN Price for certain drugs covered by Medicare Parts B and D. While the scope, details, and implementation of these contemplated

executive actions (including whether and how their mechanism may differ from that of the proposed IPI drug pricing program discussed above) are not clear, this continues to signal that the U.S. administration intends to pursue new measures to constrain drug costs and Medicare payments for drugs. Similarly, various members of the current U.S. Congress have indicated that lowering drug prices continues to be a legislative and political priority, and some have introduced proposals aimed at drug pricing.
