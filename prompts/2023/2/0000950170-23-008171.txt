Overview
 Our mission is to slow, halt, or reverse diseases of aging. Our initial focus is on creating senolytic medicines to selectively eliminate senescent cells and thereby treat diseases of aging, such as ophthalmologic diseases, with the opportunity to explore neurology and other therapeutic areas.
Diseases of aging cause considerable economic, personal, and societal burden. As individuals age, the prevalence of chronic disease increases, with 80% of older Americans having at least one chronic disease and 50% having two or more. Diseases of aging negatively impact quality of life, are typically chronic, and progress from the time of onset until death. It is estimated that providing healthcare for people over the age of 65 costs four to five times more than for younger individuals. According to the United States Census Bureau, this elderly population of Americans is expected to increase nearly 50% by 2050, increasing the economic burden of aging dramatically. Any success increasing longevity without treating underlying diseases of aging would only serve to increase this burden.
We believe that by creating medicines that target fundamental aging mechanisms, we can reduce the economic, personal, and societal burden of aging and enhance quality of life.
 In February 2022, we announced a restructuring to align resources to focus on our ongoing clinical programs and deliver on key development milestones. These actions to prioritize our ophthalmology programs and implement cost saving measures were designed to enable us to achieve multiple key clinical data readouts for UBX1325 as well as support the Tie2 and Tie2/VEGF bispecific program through advanced candidate nomination, with all other pipeline programs paused to focus resources on these advanced programs.
 Targeting Cellular Senescence and Other Biologies of Aging
 We believe that the accumulation of senescent cells is a fundamental mechanism of aging and a driver of many common diseases of aging. Cellular senescence is a natural biological state in which a cell permanently halts division. These cells are referred to as senescent. Senescent cells accumulate with age, secreting large quantities of more than 100 proteins, including inflammatory factors, proteases, fibrotic factors, and growth factors, that disturb the tissue micro-environment. This collection of secreted proteins is referred to as the Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype, or SASP. In addition to its effects on tissue function, the SASP contains factors that induce senescence in neighboring cells, setting off a cascade of events that culminates in the formation of the functionally aged and/or diseased tissue that underlies a variety of age-related diseases.
We are developing senolytic medicines to eliminate senescent cells and thereby lower the production of the SASP, which we believe addresses a root cause of age-related diseases. Many existing therapeutics, such as antibodies, target single SASP factors, but fail to remove the cells that continually produce these factors. By stopping the production of the SASP at it source, we believe senolytic medicines could have a more durable impact by slowing, halting, or reversing particular diseases of aging, and shift the treatment paradigm from chronic to intermittent dosing. Less frequent dosing may also improve drug tolerability and patient adherence. 
While our primary focus is on programs targeting cellular senescence, we are exploring other biologies of aging that may have a major impact on diseases of aging. For instance, we have a preclinical program targeting Tie2 signaling. Tie2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is implicated in regulating barrier function in blood vessels of the eye, which are affected in several prevalent eye diseases. Tie2 is also implicated in kidney disease. We also have a preclinical program targeting both Tie2 and VEGF (Tie2/VEGF bispecific) designed to neutralize VEGF and activate Tie2, two major pathways involved in retinal disease. We have outlicensed our program in α-Klotho, a protein that has been implicated in human cognition and may provide benefits in age-related cognitive dysfunctions.
Our Pipeline
We are targeting specific biological mechanisms implicated in diseases of aging. Our core therapeutic approach targets cellular senescence, and we are currently advancing senolytic programs primarily in ophthalmologic disorders. In addition, we are advancing other programs based on other biologies of aging to include an agonistic antibody to the Tie2 receptor and a Tie2/VEGF bispecific to treat vascular eye disease.
Ophthalmology Program
 
UBX1325 is our most advanced lead drug candidate for age-related diseases of the eye, including diabetic macular edema, or DME, age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, and diabetic retinopathy, or DR. UBX1967 is our back-up compound to UBX1325. Each of these drug candidates are potent small molecule inhibitors of Bcl-xL, a member of the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis regulating proteins, and has shown distinct tissue residence time profiles in preclinical studies. UBX1325 and UBX1967 are designed to inhibit the function of proteins that senescent cells rely on for survival. In our preclinical studies, we have demonstrated that targeting Bcl-xL with UBX1325 and UBX1967 preferentially eliminated senescent cells from diseased tissue while sparing cells in healthy tissue.

In July 2020, we filed an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, to commence a Phase 1, first-in-human, open-label, single-ascending dose study of UBX1325 in patients with advanced diabetic macular edema, or DME, and neovascular age-related macular degeneration, or nAMD. Our goal with UBX1325 is to transformationally improve outcomes for patients with DME, nAMD, and diabetic retinopathy, or DR. In October 2020, the Phase 1, first-in-human, clinical study of UBX1325 commenced. That study, an open-label, single ascending dose clinical trial, evaluated doses from 0.5 – 10 µg administered as a single intra-vitreal injection in up to 8 patients with DME and 11 patients with nAMD all of whom had been off all anti-VEGF treatment due to lack of benefit for at least 6 months. The results of this study demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerability without any dose-limiting toxicities; no evidence of intraocular inflammation; and mean improvement in BCVA of up to 9.5 ETDRS letters in those patients with DME receiving higher doses (5 and 10 µg) and a mean improvement in BCVA of 3.2 ETDRS letters in evaluable patients with nAMD at all doses, both at 24 weeks after treatment with UBX1325.
 
In May 2021, we initiated our Phase 2 proof-of-concept study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and durability of a single intravitreal injection of UBX1325 in a broader population of patients with DME, or the BEHOLD study, and dosed our first patient in June 2021. This study is a multi-center, randomized, double-masked, sham-controlled study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy and durability of a single 10 µg dose of UBX1325 in patients with DME evaluated though 24 weeks. Patients have the option of rolling over to a 48-week long term extension and a majority of patients who have completed their 24-week visits have opted to remain in the study. A total of 65 patients were enrolled, randomized evenly between UBX1325 and sham-injected patients. These patients were being actively treated with anti-VEGF for at least 6 months prior to being randomized into the BEHOLD study (mean of 4.03 injections in the 6 months preceding randomization), and had persistent visual acuity deficits (73 ETDRS letters or worse, approximately 20/40 or worse, mean of 61.4 letters at baseline) and residual retinal fluid (≥300 µm of central subfield thickness on optical coherence tomography, mean of approximately 439.6 µm). At the time of randomization, patients were taken off of their anti-VEGF treatment, and instead treated with UBX1325 or a sham procedure. Endpoints being explored in the study include safety and tolerability, changes in BCVA, CST, SRF/IRF, proportion of patients requiring rescue treatment, and durability of effects.
 
In August 2022, we announced positive 12- and 18-week data in our Phase 2 BEHOLD study of UBX1325 in patients with DME, including that a single injection of UBX1325 led to a progressive, statistically significant, and clinically meaningful improvement in mean best-corrected visual acuity compared to sham treatment. At Week 18, the mean change from baseline of BCVA for UBX1325-treated subjects was an increase of 6.1 ETDRS letters that represents a difference of +5.0 ETDRS letters compared to sham-treated subjects (p=0.0368). In addition, patients treated with UBX1325 maintained central subfield thickness (CST) (+3.2 microns) compared to sham-treated patients who had progressive worsening (increase) in CST through 18 weeks (+53.5 microns) (p=0.0719).

In November 2022, we announced positive 24-week data in our BEHOLD study, showing that a single injection of UBX1325 led to a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in BCVA of +6.2 ETDRS letters from baseline and +7.6 ETDRS letters compared to sham treatment (p=0.0084). Inclusive of rescue data, patients treated with UBX1325 had a mean improvement in BCVA of +6.4 ETDRS letters from baseline and +5.2 ETDRS letters compared to sham (p=0.0068). At 24 weeks, patients treated with UBX1325 had a mean change

in CST of -5.4 microns from baseline compared to a worsening (increase) of +34.6 microns in sham-treated patients (p=0.1244). The proportion of rescue-free patients at 24 weeks was greater on UBX1325 (59.4%) as compared to sham (37.5%) with fewer total rescues and longer time-to-rescue in UBX1325-treated patients as compared to sham. UBX1325 demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile with no cases of intraocular inflammation, retinal artery occlusion, endophthalmitis, or vasculitis. Patients will continue to be followed through 48 weeks post-treatment in a long-term follow-up, with data expected in the second quarter of 2023.
 
In March 2022, we enrolled our first patient in our Phase 2 proof-of-concept study in nAMD, or the ENVISION study. In September 2022, the study completed enrollment of patients with nAMD who have had at least two intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF therapy in the preceding six months and who still have active choroidal neovascularization and residual sub- or intra-retinal fluid. Patients have received their last anti-VEGF treatment approximately 4-8 weeks prior to screening, and all patients will be followed for approximately 24 weeks after dosing with either UBX1325 or aflibercept. We expect to announce both 16-week and 24-week data from this Phase 2 proof-of-concept study in nAMD in late March 2023. In addition, we amended the Phase 2 ENVISION study including a Part B portion of the study to explore the benefit of a second cycle of two doses of UBX1325 treatment 4 weeks apart, administered at Weeks 24 and 28 weeks and the potential benefit of combination treatment with anti-VEGF therapy at Weeks 24 and 32 with all patients followed through Week 48. Data from Part B of the 48-week extension study is expected in the third quarter of 2023.
 Under our current amended license agreement with Ascentage Pharma Group Corp. Limited, or Ascentage, we have, among other things, exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights and non-exclusive manufacturing rights to UBX1325 outside of Greater China (China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) in all non-oncology indications. Inside Greater China, we have the right to negotiate a joint venture with Ascentage to develop, manufacture and commercialize UBX1325. See “Licenses and Collaborations.”
We also have a Tie2/VEGF bispecific program. Tie2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is implicated in regulating barrier function in blood vessels of the eye, which are affected in several prevalent eye diseases. Tie2 is an important key regulator of the vascular endothelium in the eye and dysregulation of this pathway leads to loss of barrier integrity and healthy vasculature. Preliminary studies suggest that cellular senescence in aging eyes may induce Ang-2 and therefore deactivate Tie2, leading to ocular edema.
 The Tie2/VEGF bispecific has dual functionality on two validated targets for retinal diseases. In addition to direct activation of Tie2, the bispecific candidate is designed to neutralize VEGF-A and VEGF-B. We believe that direct agonism of Tie2 may be superior to antagonism of Ang2 which relies on adequate levels of endogenous Ang1 to activate the Tie2 pathway. We have identified Tie2/VEGF bispecific molecules that have pharmacological activity on Tie2 and VEGF with potencies relevant for clinical benefit. Based on supporting preclinical data, we designated an Advanced Candidate in July 2022. We are currently seeking to initiate pilot preclinical toxicology experiments and other work to support nomination of a Development Candidate that should enable initiation of IND-enabling studies by the end of 2023.
 UBX2050 is our investigational, fully human anti-Tie2 agonist monoclonal antibody. Tie2 dysregulation is implicated in eye disease as well as other indications. UBX2050 is derived from an asset that was acquired from Achaogen, Inc. in June 2020 through an Asset Purchase Agreement. UBX2050 was selected based on its potential to activate the Tie2 receptor in vitro and has demonstrated encouraging activity in preclinical models of ocular disease. We believe UBX2050 may be an orthogonal approach to restoring barrier function and vascular function and have explored a number of indications for UBX2050.
 Neurology Program
 
We believe cellular senescence may play a fundamental role in neurodegeneration. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that senescent cells accumulate in the nervous system during normal aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Several third-party preclinical proof of concept studies in mouse models of aging and neurodegeneration have provided preliminary evidence that the removal of senescent cells via senolytic drugs or genetic methods have the potential to improve brain function.
UBX2089, an α-Klotho hormone drug candidate, is a circulating hormone primarily produced in the kidneys and choroid plexus of the brain, which is being researched for multiple neurology indications. Human genetic evidence

links α-Klotho to cognitive function, and we have observed pro-cognitive activity of recombinant α-Klotho in multiple preclinical rodent and non-human primate models. Our work focused on investigating the effect of UBX2089 on engaging CNS circuits in preclinical animal models with the intent of advancement to clinical studies, and in December 2021, we announced an exclusive licensing agreement of our α-Klotho asset to Jocasta Neuroscience, Inc. for development and commercialization.
 Our Approach to Slowing, Halting, or Reversing Diseases of Aging
 Targeting Cellular Senescence
Cellular senescence is a natural biological state in which a cell permanently halts division. Cells become senescent when they experience some form of unresolvable cellular stress. These cellular stress events result in the activation of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which drives the production of two cell-cycle dependent kinase inhibitors, or CDK inhibitors, p21 and p16. These two molecules are required for the establishment and subsequent maintenance of the senescent cell state. The first CDK inhibitor to be produced is p21, which works through subsequent pathways to block the production of numerous proteins that cells need to divide. The initial p21-driven signal is an acute response to cell damage and eventually decreases. In contrast, p16 permanently locks the cell into a non-dividing state and the production of p16 continues as long as the cell lives. Given that p16 production, in most cases, continues indefinitely and is believed to be produced almost exclusively in senescent cells, it is a widely used marker to identify and quantify senescent cells.
The process through which stress mechanisms can induce cells to become senescent is illustrated in the figure below.


Figure 1: Illustration of induction of the senescent state and secretion of factors that can damage the microenvironment
 How Senescent Cells Drive Diseases of Aging
Once cells become senescent, they begin secreting large quantities of proteins, including pro-inflammatory factors that recruit the immune system, proteases that remodel the extra-cellular matrix, pro-fibrotic factors that drive the formation of dysfunctional matrix, and growth factors that perturb the function of the tissue micro-environment. This collection of secreted proteins is referred to as the Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype, or SASP. In addition to affecting normal tissue function, the SASP contains factors that induce senescence in neighboring cells, setting off a cascade of events that ultimately culminates in the formation of a functionally aged and/or diseased tissue that underlies a variety of age-related diseases.

Numerous SASP factors have been implicated as potentially contributing to human disease and it is now believed that the SASP is the primary means by which senescent cells drive specific diseases of aging. For example, a variety of single SASP factors (e.g., TNF-α and VEGF-A) have been demonstrated to drive human diseases by themselves and have been the target of well-known antibody therapeutics, including HUMIRA® and EYLEA®. While these antibodies are able to modify human disease by removing the activity of a single factor, we believe the clearance of senescent cells will remove the source of numerous SASP factors, providing improvement in both efficacy and duration-of-effect.
Our Therapeutic Paradigm
We were founded on the principle that the selective elimination of senescent cells and their accompanying SASP has the potential to slow, halt, or reverse diseases of aging. Our insights into senescent cell biology allow us to identify senescence-driven diseases, target the senescent cells driving a particular disease, and selectively eliminate these cells. The figure below illustrates this process.



Figure 2: Illustration of the senolytic therapeutic hypothesis
 In developing this approach, we have acquired significant expertise with respect to senescent cell survival pathways, which are the signaling systems that senescent cells rely on for survival. When these pathways are targeted with specifically designed molecules, senescent cells undergo programmed cell death. Through our research, we have identified several of these mechanistically distinct survival pathways, which differ depending on cell type and the tissue in which the senescent cells reside.
Advantages of Our Approach
We believe that senolytic medicines that selectively eliminate senescent cells from diseased tissues may have several advantages over other efforts to treat diseases of aging:
•Senolytic medicines target a root cause of diseases of aging. We believe that the accumulation of senescent cells is a root cause of many diseases of aging. Unlike treatments that inhibit the activity of a single factor (such as antibodies targeting single pro-inflammatory proteins), we believe a senolytic medicine that eliminates accumulated senescent cells and consequently also their associated SASP, could blunt the activity of numerous factors contributing to disease. As a result, senolytic medicines could have improved efficacy because they target diseases at their source and therefore may be able to normalize tissue levels of numerous disease-causing factors simultaneously. 


•Senolytic medicines can be dosed intermittently. The administration of senolytic medicines would remove senescent cells from diseased tissue. As new senescent cells may take months or perhaps years to re-accumulate, senolytic medicines could potentially be dosed infrequently. Intermittent dosing may also improve drug tolerability and patient adherence when compared to chronic therapies.
 •Senolytic medicines restore tissues to a healthy state. We believe senescent cells generally do not accumulate in young individuals and that the accumulation of senescent cells in older individuals interferes with normal tissue function. Our goal for the administration of senolytic medicines is to restore tissue to a functionally younger state. 
 Our Programs
 Ophthalmology Programs Targeting Cellular Senescence
 Unmet Need and Therapeutic Rationale
The majority of significant eye diseases are age-related, with the prevalence of vision-threatening disease increasing significantly over the age of 75. Of the 285 million individuals worldwide living with visual impairment, 65% are over the age of 50. The individual diseases that are associated with these figures include age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema, and diabetic eye diseases, all of which have a high prevalence and significant unmet need in either prevention or therapeutic options. The diseases we are evaluating as initial target indications for local administration of senolytic therapy in the eye are age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema, and diabetic retinopathy.
Diabetic Macular Edema
Diabetic macular edema is a condition in which the metabolic abnormalities associated with diabetes, including high levels of blood glucose, or hyperglycemia, damage blood vessels in the central portion of the retina, or the macula, causing those vessels to leak fluid. The leaking fluid leads to swelling and subsequently to abnormalities of vision. The prevalence of diabetic macular edema, or DME, in the United States ranges from approximately 4.0% to 6.8% of people with diabetes who are 40 years of age or older. In 2019, it was estimated that more than 20 million people worldwide are affected by DME. There is a high burden of DME among non-Hispanic blacks and robust associations with higher hemoglobin A1c and longer duration of underlying diabetes.
 Despite the success achieved with anti-VEGF treatment for retinal disease like AMD that involve the proliferation of abnormal blood vessels, or neovascularization, the impact of such treatment in DME has been more limited. This is due to the challenging nature of the therapeutic regimen (which entails monthly and or bimonthly IVT injections for up to two years), the number of cases that are refractory to anti-VEGF treatment (approximately 50% of DME patients), and the long-term complications of increased ischemia and retinal fibrosis associated with long-term treatment with anti-VEGF injections. As a result, there is an unmet need in this group of patients. Although VEGF has been identified as a major factor for neovascular disease, other factors, which we believe include SASP factors, are present in DME, including IL-1ß, TNF-, IL-6, and TGF-ß, among others. Due to the multifactorial nature of the disease, a significant opportunity exists to develop a more comprehensive approach to the treatment of DME, such as senolysis, that targets the root cause of the disease.
 Age-Related Macular Degeneration
Age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss in developed countries, particularly in people older than 60 years. In 2014, it was projected that by 2020 the number of people worldwide with AMD would be 196 million and could increase to 288 million by 2040. The prevalence of AMD increases significantly with advancing age, with a prevalence rate of 1.63% in those aged 65 to 69 years which increases to 11.73% in those aged 80 years or older. AMD affects central vision, impairing functions such as reading, driving, and facial recognition, and has a major impact on quality of life and the ability to live independently. AMD is defined in three stages: (i) “early,” in which visual function is affected in the presence of signs of age-related changes in the retina such as drusen and pigmentary changes; (ii) “intermediate,” in which increasing degrees of macular lipid

deposition and structural changes are noted; and (iii) “late,” in which central vision is compromised due to abnormal blood vessel growth (known as “wet” AMD) or advanced atrophy of the retina (known as “dry” AMD). AMD is a heterogenous, complex, multifactorial disease, with inflammatory, degenerative, genetic, and vascular factors all contributing to its development and progression. The potential role of senescent cells and the associated SASP in driving the two main presentations of the disease, both wet and dry forms, could prove a unifying mechanism across this complex disorder.
Current standard of care for wet AMD is the administration of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor, or anti-VEGF, antibody drugs that control aspects of the wet form of the disease only. The development of therapeutic options for dry AMD has proven to be challenging in that all current development candidates are aimed at slowing the progression of disease, with none able to halt or reverse the inevitable loss of functional retinal segments. Several agents that slow the progression of disease via inhibition of various factors within the complement system are in advanced stages, with EMPAVELI® (pegcetoplan) by Apellis having been approved. While there may be limited potential options for geographic atrophy (an advanced form of dry AMD), there are no approved therapies available to fully halt progression or reverse the disease. And while wet AMD has been significantly impacted by anti-VEGF therapy, that approach is limited by the need for frequent eye injections over a long period of time, a significant percentage of patients not completing or being non-responsive or poorly-responsive to anti-VEGF therapy, and the contribution of multiple other mechanisms at play in the disease beyond VEGF. Thus, there is considerable potential for a senolytic approach to impact disease progression and achieve stabilization in AMD via modulation of senescent cell burden and the accompanying SASP. SASP factors in AMD include molecules that promote abnormal blood vessel growth, inflammation, and fibrosis, all of which have been implicated in various stages of the disease. We believe that a senolytic medicine could have a meaningful and prolonged impact on the AMD disease state and help restore the cellular microenvironment to a more normal, pre-senescent state.
 Diabetic Retinopathy
Diabetic retinopathy, or DR, is estimated to affect over 90 million people globally and approximately 28 million have vision-threatening stages of disease. It is a leading cause of vision loss in middle-aged and elderly people and impacts 8% of the U.S. population over age 65. Due to the increasing diabetic population arising from lifestyle changes in developing countries, the disease incidence is predicted to climb.
Diabetic retinopathy is a complex multifactorial disease, characterized by progression through a series of stages of increasing severity. The metabolic abnormalities associated with diabetes incite a variety of inflammatory and metabolic stress-induced events which leads to proliferation of new blood vessels and subsequent bleeding and swelling, which in turn causes scarring and vision loss or may lead to blood vessel occlusion, limiting blood flow and leading to damage to the retinal photoreceptors and nerves supplied by those vessels. The risk of developing diabetic retinopathy and its severity increase with the duration of underlying diabetes. It is also associated with poor glycemic control and the presence of additional coexistent diseases, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, and impaired kidney function.
Current standard of care for diabetic retinopathy, which includes blood sugar control, anti-VEGF drugs, steroid injections, and laser therapy, is modestly effective. The limitations of existing therapy include general challenges with achieving diabetes control, the need for frequent intravitreal injections for the administration of anti-VEGF therapy, a significant percentage of patients not completing or being non-responsive to anti-VEGF therapy, and tissue destruction with permanent side effects from laser therapy. This presents a significant opportunity to design and develop a treatment paradigm, such as senolytic medications like UBX1325, that treats a root cause of the disease.
Evidence suggests that diabetic retinopathy is driven by the accumulation of senescent cells that are a direct result of elevated glucose levels in patients with diabetes. These senescent cells are triggered by local stresses in the retina and their accumulation drives the production of the accompanying ocular SASP factors, VEGF and platelet-derived growth factor, or PDGF. Overproduction of VEGF and IL-6 leads to ocular inflammation and abnormal blood vessel growth, key signatures of diabetic retinopathy. Thus, a senolytic approach could target multiple aspects of the underlying causes of diabetic retinopathy and ideally lead to greater therapeutic coverage in a wider range of patients. This elimination of senescent cell accumulation and accompanying SASP factors could limit further disease progression, reduce vessel leakage and inflammation, and prevent vision loss.

Evidence for Senescence Burden in Human Disease and Human Biomarker Discovery: AMD, DR and DME
 We evaluated the presence of senescent cells by IHC staining for p16 in post-mortem retinal donor tissue from individuals who carried a pre-mortem diagnosis of AMD, DR/DME, or neither. We believe the resulting data support our hypothesis that the accumulation of senescent cells is linked to AMD and DR/DME. Quantification of IHC images indicated a significant increase in senescent cell burden (as measured by p16+ cells) in both AMD and DR patient globes (Figure 3).


Figure 3: Quantification of senescent cell burden in AMD and DR/DME
 We also compared the presence of senescence in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells, or HRMEC, versus retinal donor tissue from human DME/DR patients by evaluating the gene expression of several disease-relevant factors. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction, or qPCR, demonstrated elevations in the SASP factors VEGF, PDGF, IL1B, and TNF in senescent HRMEC, relative to non-senescent cells. These disease-relevant mediators have been reported to be elevated in DME/DR patients. We believe this data is consistent with our hypothesis that senescent cell accumulation and SASP factors play a central role in both DME and DR.
Mechanism of Action of UBX1325 (Inhibitors of the Bcl-2 Family)
UBX1325, our lead drug candidate (along with our backup compound in our ophthalmology program, UBX1967) is a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of Bcl-xL, a specific member of the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis regulating proteins. The B-cell lymphoma 2, or Bcl-2, gene family encodes more than 20 proteins that regulate the intrinsic apoptosis pathway and are fundamental to the balance between cell survival and cell death. Inhibition of certain Bcl-2 family proteins results in cell death in certain cell types. Targeting this pathway has been studied extensively in connection with the search for new oncology medicines.

In Vitro and In Vivo Pharmacology Studies with UBX1325
We conducted an in vitro assessment of binding and efficacy of UBX1325 to determine both its potency for the Bcl-2 family protein targets and its potency at eliminating senescent cells. Biochemical assays for Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w yielded binding affinities in the sub-nanomolar range, but with a higher affinity for Bcl-xL. UBX1325 is a phosphate pro-drug that releases the active parent molecule known as UBX0601. In order to assess the activity of UBX0601 on senescent cells, we used a cell-based assay with radiation-induced senescence. Senescent cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of UBX0601 for 72 hours. In this study, UBX0601 showed potent, concentration-dependent senolytic activity against human fetal lung cells, or IMR90, primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells, or HUVEC, and HRMEC as measured by reduction of senescent cell survival. UBX0601 also demonstrated selectivity for elimination of senescent HRMEC over non-senescent HRMEC which is observed as decreased potency in the non-senescent HRMEC (Figure 4).
 
Figure 4: Concentration- dependent induction of apoptosis in HRMEC cells by UBX0601 in vitro
 We next studied the effects of UBX1325 in the retina in an in vivo model. We employed the mouse oxygen-induced retinopathy, or OIR, model, which provides an in vivo model of retinopathy of prematurity, or ROP, and DR. In this model, UBX1325 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the degree of retinal neovascularization (Figure 5).
 

Figure 5: Intravitreal injection of UBX1325 reduced retinal neovascularization in the mouse OIR model
 Based on these results in this key OIR model, we believe a single ocular injection of UBX1325 has the potential to functionally inhibit neovascularization and promote vascular repair. We believe the efficacy of UBX1325 in this OIR model is due to elimination of senescent cells and accompanying SASP that propagates senescence in retinal cells and promotes neovascularization of retinal vessels.


We then studied the in vivo efficacy of UBX1325 in a streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse, or STZ, model to understand its effects in a diabetic retina, which shows phenotypes similar to the human diseased condition. In this STZ model, UBX1325 demonstrated a significant reduction in vascular leakage as measured by Evans Blue dye permeation (Figure 6A). UBX1325 also demonstrated an improvement in the electroretinogram, or ERG, as a measure of retinal/photoreceptor function (Figure 6B). At a dose of 200 pmol delivered per eye, UBX1325 led to significant increase in the amplitude of both the A- and B-waves (p<0.01 and p<0.0001, respectively) of the ERG when compared to the vehicle control group. Lastly, the expression of several disease-relevant cytokines was elevated in the diabetic retina, but attenuation of those factors was not observed after administration of UBX1325.
 

Figure 6: Streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice have increased retinal vascular leakage (6A) and decreased A-wave amplitude in ERG (6B). Administration of UBX1325 attenuated each of these disease-relevant endpoints.
 Non-clinical toxicology studies of UBX1325, as well as its manufacturing and associated testing, have been completed to support the evaluation of the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of this molecule in further clinical studies.
UBX1325 Clinical Data and Development Plan

In July 2020, we filed an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, to commence a Phase 1, first-in-human, open-label, single-ascending dose study of UBX1325 in patients with advanced diabetic macular edema, or DME, and neovascular age-related macular degeneration, or nAMD. Our goal with UBX1325 is to transformationally improve outcomes for patients with DME, nAMD, and diabetic retinopathy, or DR. In October 2020, the Phase 1, first-in-human, clinical study of UBX1325 commenced. That study, an open-label, single ascending dose clinical trial, evaluated doses from 0.5 – 10 µg administered as a single intra-vitreal injection in up to 8 patients with DME and 11 patients with nAMD all of whom had been off all anti-VEGF treatment due to lack of benefit for at least 6 months. The results of this study demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerability without any dose-limiting toxicities; no evidence of intraocular inflammation; and mean improvement in BCVA of up to 9.5 ETDRS letters in those patients with DME receiving higher doses (5 and 10 µg) and a mean improvement in BCVA of 3.2 ETDRS letters in evaluable patients with nAMD at all doses, both at 24 weeks after treatment with UBX1325.
 
In May 2021, we initiated Phase 2 of the BEHOLD study and dosed our first patient in June 2021. This study is a multi-center, randomized, double-masked, sham- controlled study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy and durability of a single 10 µg dose of UBX1325 in patients with DME evaluated though 24 weeks. Patients have the option of rolling over to a 48-week long term extension and a majority of patients who have completed their 24-week visits have opted to remain in the study. A total of 65 patients were enrolled, randomized evenly between UBX1325 and sham-injected patients. These patients were being actively treated with anti-VEGF for at least 6 months prior to being randomized into the BEHOLD study (mean of 4.03 injections in the 6 months preceding randomization), and had persistent visual acuity deficits (73 ETDRS letters or worse, approximately 20/40 or worse) and residual retinal fluid (≥300 µm of central subfield thickness on optical coherence tomography, mean of approximately 439.6 µm). At the time of randomization, patients were taken off of their anti-VEGF treatment, and instead treated with

UBX1325 or a sham procedure. Endpoints being explored in the study include safety and tolerability, changes in BCVA, CST, SRF/IRF, proportion of patients requiring rescue treatment, and durability of effects.
 
In August 2022, we announced positive 12- and 18-week data in our Phase 2 BEHOLD study of UBX1325 in patients with DME, including that a single injection of UBX1325 led to a progressive, statistically significant, and clinically meaningful improvement in mean best-corrected visual acuity compared to sham treatment. At Week 18, the mean change from baseline of BCVA for UBX1325-treated subjects was an increase of 6.1 ETDRS letters that represents a difference of +5.0 ETDRS letters compared to sham-treated subjects (p=0.0368). In addition, patients treated with UBX1325 maintained central subfield thickness (CST) (+3.2 microns) compared to sham-treated patients who had progressive worsening (increase) in CST through 18 weeks (+53.5 microns) (p=0.0719).
 
In November 2022, we announced positive 24-week data in our BEHOLD study, showing that a single injection of UBX1325 led to a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in BCVA of +6.2 ETDRS letters from baseline and +7.6 ETDRS letters compared to sham treatment (p=0.0084). Inclusive of rescue data, patients treated with UBX1325 had a mean improvement in BCVA of +6.4 ETDRS letters from baseline and +5.2 ETDRS letters compared to sham (p=0.0068). At 24 weeks, patients treated with UBX1325 had a mean change in CST of -5.4 microns from baseline compared to a worsening (increase) of +34.6 microns in sham-treated patients (p=0.1244). The proportion of rescue-free patients at 24 weeks was greater on UBX1325 (59.4%) as compared to sham (37.5%) with fewer total rescues and longer time-to-rescue in UBX1325-treated patients as compared to sham. UBX1325 demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile with no cases of intraocular inflammation, retinal artery occlusion, endophthalmitis, or vasculitis. Patients will continue to be followed through 48 weeks post-treatment in a long-term follow-up, with data expected in the second quarter of 2023.
 
In March 2022, we enrolled our first patient in Phase 2 of the ENVISION study. In September 2022, the study has completed enrollment of patients with nAMD who have had at least two intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF therapy in the preceding six months and who still have active choroidal neovascularization and residual sub- or intra-retinal fluid. Patients have received their last anti-VEGF treatment approximately 4-8 weeks prior to screening, and all patients will be followed for approximately 24 weeks after dosing with either UBX1325 or aflibercept. We expect to announce both 16-week and 24-week data from this Phase 2 proof-of-concept study in nAMD in late March 2023. In addition, we amended the Phase 2 ENVISION study including a Part B portion of the study to explore the benefit of a second cycle of two doses of UBX1325 treatment 4 weeks apart, administered at Weeks 24 and 28 and the

potential benefit of combination treatment with anti-VEGF therapy at Weeks 24 and 32 with all patients followed through Week 48. Data from Part B of the 48-week extension study is expected in the third quarter of 2023.
 In addition to UBX1325, which targets Bcl-xL, we have preclinical stage molecules that target senescent cells via alternate mechanisms and could be the basis of future pipeline programs.
 Ophthalmology Program Targeting Tie2 Signaling
 The angiopoietin-Tie2 signaling axis is believed to play a fundamental role in vascular biology. Dysregulation of the expression of Tie2-regulating ligands angiopoietin-2 (a context dependent Tie2 antagonist ligand) and angiopoietin-1 (a Tie2 agonist ligand) has been observed in the vitreous of patients with DME, AMD, and other ocular diseases. We believe that a highly specific and potent Tie2-activating antibody will restore Tie2 signaling in ocular tissues, potentially leading to decreased vascular leak, lower levels of pathogenic angiogenesis, and a restoration of healthy blood vessels in ischemic areas of the eye. UBX2050 is an investigational Tie2-specific agonist monoclonal antibody that was selected based on its optimal binding and functional properties observed in in vitro assays. In primary human endothelial cells, or HUVECs, UBX2050 treatment activated Tie2 as measured by increased levels of cellular phospho-Tie2, and potently activated downstream signal transduction pathways as measured by increased levels of phospho-Akt and phospho-Erk1/2 by western blotting (Figure 7).
 
Figure 7. Anti-Tie2 agonist antibody Tie2-3 (UBX2050) activated Tie2 signaling with a potency comparable to angiopoietin-1 in primary endothelial cells in vitro.


The in vivo activity of UBX2050 has been explored in a laser-induced choroidal neovascularization model in mice. In this model, UBX2050 was administered to mice via the intraperitoneal route at a dose of 10 mg/kg, one day prior to laser-induced rupture of Bruch’s membrane. UBX2050 treatment, but not treatment with a non-specific isotype control antibody, significantly inhibited the area of choroidal neovascularization nine days post-injury as measured in retina/choroid flat mounts from treated animals (Figure 8). Based on this data, we believe UBX2050 has the potential to address pathogenic angiogenesis in the eyes of patients with ocular diseases such as AMD and DME.
 
Figure 8. UBX2050 treatment significantly inhibited choroidal neovascularization in a laser-induced injury model in mice.
 
We believe that the investigational Tie2 antibody (UBX2050) may be an orthogonal approach to restoring barrier function and vascular function. We are exploring a number of indications for UBX2050 and expect to nominate a Development Candidate by the end of 2023.
 Tie2/VEGF bispecific program
 Tie2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is implicated in regulating barrier function in blood vessels of the eye, which are affected in several prevalent eye diseases. Tie2 is an important key regulator of the vascular endothelium in the eye and dysregulation of this pathway leads to loss of barrier integrity and healthy vasculature. Preliminary studies suggest that cellular senescence in aging eyes may induce Ang-2 and therefore deactivate Tie2, leading to ocular edema. The Tie2/VEGF bispecific has dual functionality on two validated targets for retinal diseases. In addition to direct activation of Tie2, the bispecific candidate is designed to neutralize VEGF-A and VEGF-B. We believe that direct agonism of Tie2 may be superior to antagonism of Ang2 which relies on adequate levels of endogenous Ang1 to activate the Tie2 pathway. We have identified Tie2/VEGF bispecific molecules that have pharmacological activity on Tie2 and VEGF with potencies relevant for clinical benefit. Based on supporting preclinical data, we designated an Advanced Candidate in July 2022. We are currently seeking to initiate pilot preclinical toxicology experiments and other work to support nomination of a Development Candidate that should enable initiation of IND-enabling studies by the end of 2023.
Neurology Program
 
UBX2089, a α-Klotho hormone drug candidate, is a circulating hormone primarily produced in the kidneys and choroid plexus of the brain, which is being researched for multiple neurology indications. Human genetic evidence links α-Klotho to cognitive function, and we have observed pro-cognitive activity of recombinant α-Klotho in multiple preclinical rodent and non-human primate models. Our work focused on investigating the effect of UBX2089 on engaging CNS circuits in preclinical animal models with the intent of advancement to clinical studies, and in December 2021, we announced an exclusive licensing agreement of our α-Klotho asset to Jocasta Neuroscience, Inc. for development and commercialization.
Manufacturing
 Our success will depend on our ability to deliver reliable, high-quality preclinical and clinical drug supply. As we mature and approach commercial stage operations, securing reliable high-quality commercial drug supply will be critical. We contract with third parties for the manufacture of our drug candidates for clinical studies. Because we rely on contract manufacturers, we employ personnel with extensive technical, manufacturing, analytical, and quality experience. Our staff has strong project management discipline to oversee contract manufacturing and testing activities, and to compile manufacturing and quality information for our regulatory submissions.
Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulation that imposes various procedural and documentation requirements and that governs record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, and more. Our systems and our contractors are required to be in compliance with these regulations, and compliance is assessed regularly through monitoring of performance and a formal audit program.
Our current supply chains for our lead drug candidates involve several manufacturers that specialize in specific operations of the manufacturing process, specifically, raw materials manufacturing, drug substance manufacturing, drug product manufacturing, and drug product labeling, packaging, and storage. We currently operate under purchase order programs for our drug candidates with Material Service Agreements in place, and we intend to establish long-term supply agreements in the future. We believe our current manufacturers have the scale, the systems, and the experience to supply all planned clinical studies.
We do not currently require commercial manufacturing capabilities. Should our needs change, we will likely need to scale up our manufacturing processes to enable commercial launch. To ensure continuity in our supply chain, we plan to establish supply arrangements with alternative larger scale suppliers for certain portions of our supply chain, as appropriate.
Commercialization Plan
 We do not currently have, nor do we expect to have in the near term, any FDA-approved drugs in our portfolio. Therefore, we have not yet built an infrastructure for sales, marketing, or commercial distribution.
Should any of our drug candidates move into pivotal clinical trials intended to support an application for market authorization, we intend to develop a plan to commercialize them in the United States and other key markets, through an internal infrastructure or external partnerships.
Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including the field of research in aging, are typically rife with rapid technological developments, bold competition, and dependence on intellectual property. Like any biotechnology company, we face competition from multiple sources, including large or established pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and wellness companies, academic research institutions, government agencies, and private institutions. We believe our drug candidates will prevail amid the competitive landscape through their efficacy, safety, administration methods and convenience, cost, public and institutional demand, intellectual property portfolio, and treatment of the root cause of many diseases of aging.
We are aware of other companies seeking to develop treatments to prevent or treat diseases of aging through various biological pathways, including several large pharmaceutical companies that have exploratory programs as well as a number of earlier-stage companies. Most of these companies are either in early stages of discovery research in senescence or have not yet disclosed pipeline candidates or mechanisms of interest, and those companies that have disclosed pipeline candidates are targeting other pathways. Hence, we believe that we currently have the most advanced program addressing cellular senescence.
Our drug candidates are likely to compete against current therapies from a wide range of companies and technologies, including therapies for ophthalmology diseases: current standard of care treatments include anti-VEGF

antibodies (bevacizumab, ranibizumab, aflibercept, brolucizumab); VEGF/Ang2 bispecific antibodies (faricimab); intravitreal steroid (dexamethasone); pan-retinal photocoagulation by laser for both neovascular AMD, DR, and DME; and possibly complement inhibitors (e.g., pegcetacoplan) for the geographic atrophy form of AMD.
  Many of our competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance, rendering our treatments obsolete or non-competitive. Accelerated merger and acquisition activity in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical study sites, patient registration for clinical studies, and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our commercial opportunity could be substantially limited in the event that our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, more tolerable, more convenient, or less expensive than our comparable products. In geographies that are critical to our commercial success, competitors may also obtain regulatory approvals before us, resulting in our competitors building a strong market position in advance of our products’ entry. We believe the factors determining the success of our programs will be the efficacy, safety, and convenience of our drug candidates.
Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in large part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products and technologies and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Our policy is to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications that relate to our proprietary technologies, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trademarks, know-how, continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
Patent Portfolio
Our patent portfolio consists of a combination of issued and allowed patents and pending patent applications that are owned or co-owned by us and/or licensed to us from third parties. The majority of these patents and applications cover our cellular senescence program, and others pertain to our programs that target aging mechanisms beyond cellular senescence, including the administration of a Tie2 receptor agonist or α-Klotho hormone. As of March 1, 2023, we own, co-own, or have an exclusive license in certain fields of use to more than 150 patents and pending applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. This portfolio includes 37 issued and allowed U.S. patents and applications and 46 granted and allowed foreign patents and applications, respectively.
In general, patents have a term of 20 years from the earliest claimed non-provisional priority date. The patent term may be extendible by up to five years in certain countries by means of patent term extension depending on the regulatory pathway and the remaining term upon marketing approval. Certain other patents and patent applications directed to our patent portfolio, if they were to issue, may have later expiration dates. Any pending U.S. provisional application is not eligible to become an issued patent until, among other things, we file a non-provisional patent application within 12 months of filing the related provisional patent application. If we do not timely file any non-provisional patent application, we may lose our priority date with respect to our provisional patent application and any patent protection on the inventions disclosed in our provisional patent application.
 Ophthalmology Programs
We have a license with Ascentage to two patent families of issued and pending composition of matter patents directed to specific Bcl-xL inhibitors including UBX0601, the active parent molecule of our lead drug candidate, UBX1325. This license grants us exclusive development and commercialization rights and non-exclusive manufacturing rights to UBX1325 for all non-oncology indications outside of Greater China (China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan).

manufacture and commercialize UBX1325. Patents in these two patent families have been granted in the United States, South Korea, New Zealand, South Africa, Australia, Canada, China, India, Singapore, Japan and Europe, and others are pending in India and Singapore. Patents that issue from these two patent families are expected to expire in 2032 and 2034, excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions.
Our license agreement with Ascentage also grants us the right to continue our preclinical development efforts with UBX1967 (our back-up compound to UBX1325) until the time we wish to submit an IND for UBX1967, at which point we would be required to enter into a separate license agreement with Ascentage covering UBX1967.
We co-own a patent family encompassing the use of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL inhibitors generally to treat various age-related eye diseases by targeting senescent cells (which also covers aspects of our neurology programs) with the Buck Institute and the Mayo Clinic. We have exclusive licenses from each of the Buck Institute and the Mayo Clinic to this patent family in the field of senescence. To date, three U.S. patents and a European, a New Zealand, a Hong Kong, and a South Africa patent have issued in this patent family which are directed to treating age related eye diseases, including age-related macular degeneration. Other patent applications are pending in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Singapore and South Korea. Patents that issue from this family are expected to expire in 2035, excluding any patent term adjustments and patent term extensions.
 We also solely own a patent family that specifically claims the composition of matter of UBX1325 and closely related compounds, as well as general methods of use of UBX1325. As of March 1, 2023 we have two issued U.S. patents and one pending U.S. application as well as pending applications in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan, Hong Kong, and South Korea. Future patents issued from this family are expected to expire in 2039, excluding any patent term adjustments and patent term extensions.
 We solely own a patent family that specifically covers the sequence, epitope, alternative antibody formats, and use of UBX2050 not only for ophthalmic diseases, but also other indications, including kidney. Future patents issuing from this family are expected to expire in 2040, excluding any patent term adjustments and patent term extensions. We also solely own a U.S. provisional patent application that specifically covers the sequences of our Tie2/VEGF bispecific UBX2048 and variants for many indications, including ocular. Future patents issuing from this family are expected to expire in 2043, excluding any patent term adjustments and patent term extensions.

 Licenses and Collaborations
 Description of Ascentage Agreements
We were a party to three agreements, or the Commercial Agreements, with Ascentage Pharma: (a) a compound library and option agreement executed in February 2016, the Library Agreement, granting the Company the right to research and nominate an active compound from Ascentage’s library of Bcl compounds and subsequently nominate a development candidate from any active compound in order to begin GLP toxicology work for indications outside of oncology, which expired in February 2022; (b) a license agreement executed in February 2016 granting the Company rights to an Ascentage Pharma compound known as APG1252, or the APG1252 License Agreement, which the Company terminated in July 2020 due to the Company’s decision to prioritize the progression of UBX1325;and (c) a second license agreement executed in January 2019 granting the Company world-wide rights to develop and commercialize UBX0601, the active parent molecule of our lead drug candidate UBX1325, outside of Greater China, or the Original Bcl Agreement, for indications outside of oncology.
The Commercial Agreements referenced above include cash payments of up to $70.3 million as well as the equity payments of up to an aggregate of (a) 93,333 shares of common stock in the event there is only one licensed product; and (b) 133,333 shares of common stock in the event there are two or more licensed products, in each case to be issued based on the Company’s achievement of certain preclinical and clinical development and sales milestone events. The Company is required to make 80% of all equity payments to Ascentage Pharma and the remaining 20% to an academic institution from whom Ascentage Pharma had previously licensed the technology. The milestones include the advancement of additional compounds into Investigational New Drug application , or IND, enabling studies, the filing of an IND, the commencement of clinical studies, Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and/or European Medicines Agency approval, and a net sales threshold. The Original Bcl License Agreement also includes tiered royalties in the low-single digits based on sales of licensed products.

The Original Bcl License Agreement also includes tiered royalties in the low-single digits based on sales of licensed products.
As of December 31, 2022, pursuant to the Commercial Agreements, the Company had issued 126,975 shares of common stock to Ascentage Pharma and 29,194 shares of common stock to the academic institution from whom Ascentage Pharma had previously licensed the technology. The Company had issued no additional shares pursuant to the Commercial Agreements during the year ended December 31, 2022. In May 2021, the Company initiated a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study of UBX1325 in patients with diabetic macular edema. As a result of the first patient dosed in the Phase 2 proof-of-concept UBX1325 study in June 2021, the Company triggered a milestone payment of $2.0 million for Ascentage Pharma, which the Company elected to settle in shares of the Company’s common stock. At the instruction of Ascentage Pharma, the Company issued 29,477 shares of its common stock to Ascentage Pharma as of August 2021 with a fair market value of $1.1 million net of withholding taxes, and 10,527 shares of its common

stock to the academic institution with a fair market value of $0.4 million at settlement date. The milestone payment was recognized as research and development expense in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company had previously issued 36,166 shares of its common stock with a value of $2.3 million to Ascentage Pharma as of December 31, 2020.
 The Commercial Agreements included contingent consideration in the form of additional issuances of shares of the Company’s common stock based on the achievement of the specified milestones. Upon the July 2020 termination of the license to APG1252, the Company determined that the contingency no longer applied and adjusted the fair value of the contingent consideration liability to zero. To date, no royalties were due from the sales of licensed products.
 Under the terms of the Original Bcl Agreement, Ascentage granted us the following rights for all non-oncology indications outside of Greater China (China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan): (i) exclusive worldwide development rights, and (ii) exclusive commercialization rights. Inside Greater China we have the right to negotiate a joint venture with Ascentage to develop, manufacture and commercialize UBX1325. The Original Bcl Agreement also stipulates that Ascentage has the right to manufacture at least 50% of our supply requirements of the licensed compound, provided they achieve and maintain certain manufacturing quality standards. This Original Bcl Agreement was amended in the fourth quarter of 2019 to remove certain field and territory limitations and to amend the schedule of licensed patents related to UBX1967, and then amended again in the first quarter of 2020 to further amend and restate the schedule of licensed patents. This Original Bcl Agreement was amended a third time in June 2020 to switch the status of UBX1967 from Licensed Compound to back-up compound, and conversely the status of UBX1325 from back-up to Licensed Compound.
Additional License Agreements
We are party to two additional license agreements that support our senescence-related patent portfolio. These agreements are with an entity affiliated with the Mayo Clinic, or Mayo, and the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, or Buck, and provide us with a worldwide, exclusive, sublicensable license under those counter-parties’ rights to a patent family that is co-owned by Buck, Mayo and us to develop and commercialize licensed products, including for the treatment of senescence-related diseases in therapeutic areas including ophthalmology and neurological diseases.
Under our June 2013 license with Mayo, we may be obligated to make development and sales milestone payments to Mayo of up to $10.8 million in the aggregate, to pay Mayo a percentage of certain sublicensing revenue that is between the high-single digits and the low-teens, and to pay Mayo running royalty payments ranging from less than 1% to low-single digit percentages on net sales of licensed products. Our obligation to pay running royalties to Mayo under the agreement is subject to a non-material minimum annual royalty and could potentially extend until January 1, 2037. We also issued 67,796 shares of our common stock to Mayo under this agreement. Our agreement with Mayo continues until the later of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim within the licensed patents and (ii) 13 years after first commercial sale of the first licensed product. We may terminate the agreement for convenience, and either party may terminate the agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach.
Under our January 2017 license with Buck, which includes similar rights to a second patent family that is co-owned only by Buck and us, we may be obligated to make development and sales milestone payments to Buck of up to $5.4 million in the aggregate, to pay Buck a mid-single digit percentage of certain sublicensing revenue, and to pay Buck running royalty payments ranging from less than 1% to low-single digit percentages on net sales of licensed products. Our obligation to pay running royalties to Buck under the agreement is subject to a non-material minimum annual royalty and could potentially extend until January 1, 2037. We also issued 13,220 shares of our common stock to Buck under this agreement. The term of our license agreement with Buck continues until the expiration of all our payment obligations to Buck thereunder. We may terminate the agreement for convenience, and either party may terminate the agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach.
We are also party to license agreements relating to our α-Klotho program. In May 2019, we entered into an exclusive license with The Regents of the University of California for intellectual property and know-how for the development of human therapeutics to treat cognitive decline in exchange for development and sales milestones and low single-digit percentages on net sales of licensed products. In December 2021, we signed an exclusive license

agreement licensing our rights in the α-Klotho asset to Jocasta Neuroscience, Inc. for development and commercialization, under which we received a $5 million upfront cash payment from Jocasta, and we will also receive additional payments based on development milestones, approval milestones, and sales-based royalties, per indication.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States (including federal, state and local authorities) and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, pricing, and export and import of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Government Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations, and biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and its implementing regulations. FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. Drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during the drug development process, clinical testing, the approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
The process required by the FDA before drug candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with GLP regulations; 
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin; 
 •approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee representing each clinical site before each clinical study may be initiated; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies to establish the safety and efficacy, or in the case of a biologic, the safety, purity and potency, of the drug candidate for each proposed indication; 
 •preparation of and submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, or biologics license application, or BLA, after completion of all pivotal clinical studies; 
 •review of the product application by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate and if applicable; 
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to file the application for review; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities where the drug candidate is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP; and 
 •FDA review and approval of an NDA or BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug or biologic in the United States. 
 An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational new drug. An IND

must become effective before human clinical studies may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical studies. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical studies can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to commence.
Clinical Studies
Clinical studies involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with Good Clinical Practice regulations, or GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical study and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical study site’s IRB before the studies may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the study until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
The clinical investigation of a drug or biologic is generally divided into three or four phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined.
•Phase 1. The drug or biologic is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational new drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. 
 •Phase 2. The drug or biologic is administered to a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks and preliminarily evaluate efficacy. 
 •Phase 3. The drug or biologic is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites to generate enough data to statistically evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. 
 •Phase 4. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA or BLA for a drug candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical studies after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical studies after approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies. 
 A pivotal study is a clinical study that adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidate’s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the product. Generally, pivotal studies are Phase 3 studies, but the FDA may accept results from Phase 2 studies if the study design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need and the results are sufficiently robust.
The FDA, the IRB or the clinical study sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical studies are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. A sponsor may also suspend or terminate a clinical study based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
Submission of an NDA or BLA to the FDA
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational new drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA

or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs and BLAs is subject to a substantial application user fee. Applications for orphan drug products are exempted from the NDA and BLA application user fees.
An NDA or BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA.
Once an NDA or BLA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review the application within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application receives priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug or biologic to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions and typically follows such recommendations.
The FDA’s Decision on an NDA or BLA
After the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical study(ies), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical studies, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA could also approve the NDA or BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical studies. Such post-market testing may include Phase 4 clinical studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
Expedited Review and Accelerated Approval Programs
The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval, and priority review, that are intended to expedite the development and approval of new drugs and biologics that address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases and conditions. To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet

medical need. The FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast-track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs or biologics that are designed to treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months. These six- and 10-month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Products that are eligible for fast-track designation may also be eligible for priority review.
In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug or biologic may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies, or such post-marketing studies fail to confirm the predicted clinical benefit.
Moreover, under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, passed in July 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biologic that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. This designation includes all of the features of fast track designation, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The breakthrough therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, but these can also be granted to the same product candidate if the relevant criteria are met. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
 Fast track designation, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs and biologics marketed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements.
Manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to

expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product; 
 •complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 •fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies; 
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or BLAs or supplements to approved NDAs or BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product licenses or approvals; 
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA or NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA or BLA, to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA or NDA application user fee.

A designated orphan drug many not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or, as noted above, if the second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with orphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Biosimilars and Exclusivity
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. To date, only a handful of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, although numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars.
Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical studies to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
Hatch-Waxman Amendments and Exclusivity
Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use

from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product. ANDAs are termed “abbreviated” because they are generally not required to include preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo or other testing. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a subject’s bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug. In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s drug or a method of using the drug. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA.
Upon submission of an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA, an applicant must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except where the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent through the last type of certification, also known as a paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all of the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the paragraph IV certification. If the paragraph IV certification is challenged by an NDA holder or the patent owner(s) asserts a patent challenge to the paragraph IV certification, the FDA may not approve that application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the notice of the paragraph IV certification, the expiration of the patent, when the infringement case concerning each such patent was favorably decided in the applicant’s favor or settled, or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay. In instances where an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant files a paragraph IV certification, the NDA holder or patent owner(s) regularly take action to trigger the 30-month stay, recognizing that the related patent litigation may take many months or years to resolve.
The FDA also cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until all applicable non-patent exclusivities listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug have expired. For example, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may obtain five years of non-patent exclusivity upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug containing an active moiety that has not been approved by FDA in any other NDA. An “active moiety” is defined as the molecule responsible for the drug substance’s physiological or pharmacologic action. During that five-year exclusivity period, the FDA cannot accept for filing (and therefore cannot approve) any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any 505(b)(2) NDA that relies on the FDA’s approval of the drug, provided that that the FDA may accept an ANDA four years into the NCE exclusivity period if the ANDA applicant also files a Paragraph IV certification.
A drug, including one approved under Section 505(b)(2), may obtain a three-year period of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, the FDA would be precluded from approving any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for the protected modification until after that three-year exclusivity period has run. However, unlike NCE exclusivity, the FDA can accept an application and begin the review process during the exclusivity period.


Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, and physician sunshine laws and regulations. If their operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, they may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and individual imprisonment.
Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of any product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products, drugs and services. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product and also have a material adverse effect on sales.
Healthcare Reform
 In March 2010, former President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments and fraud and abuse changes. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act increases the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; requires collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; requires manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 70 percent point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and imposes a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect there will be additional challenges and other efforts to repeal or replace the Affordable Care Act in the future. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
 Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of personal information, including health-related information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information and could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 32 employees, all of whom were full-time. Approximately 41% of our employees hold advanced degrees. On February 2, 2022, we implemented a corporate restructuring to align our resources to focus on its UBX1325 program while further extending operating capital. The restructuring resulted in an elimination of approximately half of our workforce by the middle of 2022.
The majority of our employees work in our corporate headquarters. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 Our human capital resources objectives are, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. As such, we expend considerable time, attention, and financial resources on these activities. Our corporate culture, which is underpinned by our company values, is the overarching framework we use to make decisions related to people practices, including total compensation, short and long-term incentives, health and wellness, and employee engagement.
 Facilities
 Our corporate headquarters are located in South San Francisco, California, where we currently lease approximately 62,000 square feet of office and laboratory space pursuant to a lease dated February 28, 2019, of which approximately 23,000 square feet was subleased as of June 2021 through August 2024, and approximately 15,000 square feet was subleased as of July 2022 through June 2024. The majority of our employees work at our corporate headquarters.
Legal Proceedings
 We are not currently involved in any litigation or legal proceedings that, in management’s opinion, are likely to have any material adverse effect on our company. While we know of no imminent legal action in which we are likely to be involved, we may in the future become engaged in litigation or other legal proceedings. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact due to defense fees, settlement costs, demands on management attention, and other concerns.
