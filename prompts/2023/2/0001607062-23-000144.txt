Loyalty
 The Group spent over two years building a cutting edge, proprietary IT architecture to effectively scale and support our ecosystem’s companies, consumers and merchants (the “Platform”). Using our Society Pass loyalty platform, which we plan to introduce in 2023, consumers may earn, and merchants may issue, loyalty points or “Society Points” across our subsidiaries. The Company aggregates data generated across various touch points, builds a realistic view of consumer behavior and uses this data to increase sales across our ecosystem by: cross-pollinating acquired companies with other existing verticals, customer re-targeting, offline and online behavior prediction and cross promotions and loyalty points. The Company ecosystem becomes a key enabler for our users by converting this aggregation of data into creation of loyalty for our ecosystem companies to generate revenue:

• | More revenue generation for merchants leads to creation of customer loyalty;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | More customer loyalty creation leads to more consumers for merchants;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | More consumers for merchants lead to greater revenues for merchants, which results in
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Virtuous cycle of revenue generation and loyalty creation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

Lifestyle
 The Group operates an online lifestyle business in Vietnam to enable the consumers to purchase high-end brands of all categories under its own brand name of “Leflair”. Consumers search or review their favorite brands among hundreds of choices in Apparel, Bags & Shoes, Accessories, Health & Beauty, Home & Lifestyle, International, Women, Men and Kids & Babies categories. The platform also allows consumers to order from hundreds of vendor choices with personalized promotions based on purchase history and location. The platform has also partnered up with a Vietnam-based delivery company, Amilo, to offer seamless delivery of product from merchant to consumer’s home or office at the touch of a button. Consumers can place orders for delivery or collect at the Company’s logistics center.
Grocery and Food Delivery
 The Group operates several online platforms in Vietnam, under the brand name of “Handycart”, and in the Philippines, under the brand names of “Pushkart” and “Mangan”, to enable the consumers to purchase meals from restaurants and food from local grocery and food merchants and deliver to them in their area.
Telecommunications
 The Company operates a Singapore-based online telecommunication reseller platform under the brand name of “Gorilla” to enable the consumers to subscribe local mobile data and overseas internet data in a different subscription package. Established in Singapore in 2019, Gorilla offers a full suite of mobile communication services such as local calls, international roaming, data, and SMS texting and network coverage in over 150 countries. Gorilla temporarily suspended providing local service in Singapore while it updates its operating software.
Digital Media 
 The acquisition of a digital media platform, TMG, amplifies the reach and engagement of the Company’s e-commerce ecosystem and retail partners. Originally founded in 2010, TMG today creates and distributes digital advertising campaigns across its multi-channel network in both SEA and the US. With its intimate knowledge of local markets, digital marketing technology tools and social commerce business focus, advertisers leverage TMG’s wide influencer network throughout SEA to market and sell advertising inventory exclusively with specific placement and effect.
 As a result, Thoughtful Media’s content creator partners earn a larger share of advertising revenues from international consumer brands. Thoughtful Media’s data-rich multi-channel network has uploaded over 675,000 videos with over 80 billion video views. The current network of 263 YouTube channels has onboarded over 85 million subscribers with an average monthly viewership of over 600 million views.

Travel
 The Company purchased the Nusatrip Group, a leading Jakarta-based Online Travel Agency (“OTA”) in Indonesia and across SEA. The Nusatrip acquisition extended SoPa’s business reach into SEA regional travel industry and marked the Company’s first foray into Indonesia. Established in 2013 as the first Indonesian OTA accredited by the International Air Transport Association, Nusatrip pioneered offering a comprehensive range of airlines and hotels to Indonesian corporate and retail customers. With its first mover advantage, Nusatrip has onboarded over 1.2 million registered users, over 500 airlines and over 200,000 hotels around the world as well as connected with over 80 million unique visitors.
 As of March 21, 2023, we have onboarded over 3.3 million registered consumers and over 200,000 registered merchants/brands on our Platform.

 Follow-on Public Offering
 On February 11, 2022, we closed a public offering of 3,484,845 shares of our common and warrants to purchase 3,484,845 shares of our common stock (including the full exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option) at a public offering price of $3.30 per share and warrant to purchase one share of common stock. We received aggregate proceeds from the public offering of $11.5 million before deducting underwriting fees and commission and other offering expenses.
Our Market Opportunity
 We expect that continued strong economic expansion, robust population growth, rising level of urbanization, the emergence of the middle class and the increasing rate of adoption of mobile technology provide market opportunities for our Company in SEA. As of 2020, SEA gross domestic product (“GDP”) totaled $3.1 trillion. In comparison, the respective GDP for both the European Union (“EU”) and the United States (“US”) totaled $15 trillion and $20.8 trillion in 2020. SEA has experienced rapid economic growth rates in recent years, far exceeding growth in major world economies such as Japan, the EU and the US. According to the International Monetary Fund (“IMF”) since 2010, SEA has averaged 4.6% GDP growth, compared to 0.7% for Japan, 0.8% for the EU and 1.7% for the US.
 SEA continues to enjoy robust population growth. The United Nations Population Division estimates that the population of the SEA countries in 2000 was approximately 525 million people growing to 668 million in 2020.

And despite the ongoing effects from the Covid-19 pandemic, the Internet economy continues to boom in SEA. According to Google Temasek e-Conomy SEA 2020 Report, Internet usage in the region increased with 40 million new users added in 2020 for a total of 400 million compared to 360 million in 2019. Seventy percent of SEA’s population is now online, compared to approximately twenty percent in 2009. In addition, SEA mobile Internet penetration now reaches more than 67%. E-commerce, online media and food delivery adoption and usage surged with the total value of goods and services sold via the Internet, or gross merchandise value (“GMV”), in SEA, expected to reach more than $100 billion by year end 2020 according to Google, Temasek, Bain SEA Report 2020. In fact, the SEA Internet sector GMV is forecast to grow to over $300 billion by 2025.
 We believe that these ongoing positive economic and demographic trends in SEA propelled demand for our Platform.
 We incurred net losses of $34,015,022 and $34,864,740 in fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
 Our Growth Strategy
 Acquiring other e-Commerce companies and applications in SEA
 To complement our organic growth strategy, we will continue to opportunistically acquire regional e-commerce companies and applications to drive revenues and increase the number of registered consumers and merchants in our SoPa ecosystem throughout SEA with particular focuses on Vietnam, Philippines and Indonesia. Our anticipated investments and acquisitions of other e-commerce platforms and applications in different verticals are expected to expand our service offerings and attract new consumers and merchants.
Launching our Loyalty System
 In 2023, we intend to market our unique merchant agnostic and universal Society Points to generate additional revenues for merchants and create permanent customer loyalty in SEA. For consumers, Society Points will offer them both a cashless payment option and the ability to spend bonus points accumulated from one consumer vertical such as lifestyle to a separate one such as travel.
Entering into Strategic Partnerships
 In 2022, the Company entered into agreements to expand its e-commerce business. Strategic partnerships are vital to the strategy and operations of Society Pass ecosystem as they enable our Platform to offer more value-added services to both our consumers and merchants. We are constructing a regional loyalty alliance comprising of synergistic merchant partners. Through our partnerships, we gain access to our partners’ clients and users at minimal cost where possible and to proliferate the usage of Society Points (when available). From our partnerships, we also enhance our offerings like reliable delivery services through our relationships with delivery service providers and vendor financing options through our partnerships with financial institutions. Our marketing approach to engage strategic partners focuses on the benefits of joining our Loyalty Alliance, stressing the ability to access a larger pool of consumers and clients while reducing marketing expenses via joint marketing efforts like press interviews, brochures and co-branding initiatives with merchants.
 Maximizing the value of consumer transactions
 Growing our consumer base, converting registered consumers into active ones, increasing transaction frequency, and maximizing basket sizes are key growth drivers for our verticals. We are growing our base of registered consumers through a multi-pronged marketing approach across social media, emails, SMS, QR codes, tailored promotional campaigns and public relations engagement. We believe that by serving consumers in all aspects of their daily lives, we create more opportunities to cross-sell and thus maximize our consumer wallet share.

Expanding service offerings to merchants
 Merchants are a critical component of our business, thus growing our registered merchant base and serving them with desirable technology and marketing solutions to improve sales, cut costs, and realize operational efficiencies. We onboard merchants through marketing outreach tools such as our websites, public relations, social media and focused sales efforts. In our marketing messages, we attract merchants to our ecosystem by offering them access to our growing consumer base as well as numerous opportunities to optimize their sales, including enhanced customer loyalty through the expected launch of our Society Points in 2023.
 Expectation of Competition
 We operate a loyalty-focused e-commerce ecosystem operates in several verticals. Across these verticals, we compete with other online platforms for merchants, who can sell their products on other platforms or marketplaces.
 We also compete with other e-commerce platforms, fashion retailers and restaurants for the attention of the consumer. Consumers have the choice of shopping with any online or offline retailers, large marketplaces or restaurant chains that may also have the ability to build their own independent online platforms. We are able to compete for consumers based on our ability to deliver a personalized e-commerce experience with easy-to-use mobile apps, well-integrated payments and a reliable platform.
