 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Overview
We are a targeted oncology company developing precision medicines tailored to biomarker-defined patient groups with specific unmet needs. With our robust biomarker and translational approach, we aim to develop targeted treatments and define patient populations who are most likely to respond to treatment. Our current programs are across the Hippo pathway, RAS pathway, and key immune signaling pathways in the tumor-microenvironment (“TME”). Our approach in each of our programs is to target both cancer-driving targets and mechanisms of resistance to other targeted therapies. Our most advanced targeted oncology program, IK-930, is a paralog-selective inhibitor of the transcriptional enhanced associate domain (“TEAD”). The TEAD transcription factors execute the ultimate step in the Hippo signaling pathway, a known tumor suppressor pathway that also drives resistance to multiple targeted and chemo therapies. Our first program in the RAS pathways, IK-595, is designed to trap MEK and RAF in an inactive complex, more completely inhibiting RAS signals than existing inhibitors. In addition, we are developing IK-175, an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (“AHR”) antagonist in collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb. Our focus on patient-driven development allows us to research both known and novel targets, with a shared guiding principle of aiming to address the unmet needs of biomarker-defined patient populations. Since we commenced operations in 2016, we have advanced multiple product candidates into clinical development. In addition, we have a robust discovery engine and a portfolio of early stage targeted oncology programs. Across the entirety of our pipeline, shown below, we aim to utilize our depth of institutional knowledge and breadth of tools to efficiently develop the right drug using the right modality for the right patient.
 

Our most advanced targeted oncology product candidate, IK-930, is an oral, paralog-selective, small molecule inhibitor of TEAD, a transcription factor in the Hippo signaling pathway. The Hippo pathway is genetically altered in approximately 10% of human cancers and is widely accepted as a prevalent driver of cancer pathogenesis and a mediator of poor outcomes for patients. In our ongoing first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial, we are focusing on indications that provide the potential to achieve rapid proof-of-concept, such as NF2 deficient mesothelioma and solid tumors with YAP1 or TAZ gene fusions, including epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (“EHE”). Approximately 40% of mesothelioma patients are genetically deficient for the tumor suppressor NF2 and 100% of EHE patients have oncogenic YAP1 or TAZ gene fusions. In October 2021, our Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) for IK-930 was cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and we subsequently initiated a first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of IK-930 as a monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors with or without gene alterations in the Hippo pathway. The first patient was dosed in January 2022. IK-930 received orphan drug designation for the treatment of mesothelioma from the FDA in March 2022. In June 2022, IK-930 was granted fast track designation from the FDA for the treatment of unresectable NF2-deficient mesothelioma. In addition to the monotherapy approach, we plan to assess IK-930 in combination with other targeted therapies across several indications with multiple targeted therapies. Based on the role that the Hippo pathway plays in resistance to other targeted therapies, we believe that IK-930 may expand the patient populations that could benefit from therapies like EGFR inhibitors, KRAS inhibitors, and MEK inhibitors, among others. We have an established clinical collaboration with AstraZeneca for the evaluation of osimertinib
in combination with IK-930 for patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancers as a cohort in the clinical program. Initial data from the monotherapy IK-930 clinical program is expected in the second half of 2023.
 We nominated a development candidate in our RAS pathway program in November 2022. The RAS pathway is implicated in at least half a million new cancer diagnoses each year in the United States alone. We aim to target the pathway on multiple levels, including preventing known resistance mechanisms to achieve deep and sustained responses. Our first program in the space, IK-595, is designed to achieve novel inhibition of MEK-RAF by trapping MEK and RAF in an inactive complex, more completely inhibiting RAS signals than existing inhibitors. IK-595’s potential ability to complex CRAF, in particular, prevents a well-recognized signaling bypass mechanism that cancer cells employ to drive therapeutic resistance to other drugs in this class. In addition, trapping CRAF in an inactive complex prevents the kinase independent anti-apoptotic function in RAS and RAF mutant cancers, a mechanism that cannot be addressed with first generation MEK inhibitors or pan-RAF inhibitors. We are developing IK-595 as an oral therapy, with a half-life designed to enable a pharmacokinetic profile that we believe can be potentially superior to other pathway inhibitors, with the goal of optimizing the therapeutic window for patients. We plan to submit an IND to the FDA for IK-595 in the second half of 2023.
These two programs, IK-930 and IK-595, stemmed from our internal discovery engine, which continues its focus on discovering and developing novel targeted oncology programs. Our early research follows our philosophy of designing treatments for selected patient populations identified through the genetic make-up of their tumors and with the potential to expand the patient population that can benefit from targeted oncology through tackling mechanisms of therapeutic resistance. Our pipeline also includes our immune-signaling program targeting AHR with our novel inhibitor, IK-175. The ongoing Phase 1a/1b clinical trial is evaluating IK-175 as a monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including urothelial carcinomas, for which current standard-of-care therapy is no longer effective or is intolerable. Initial clinical data from the program was presented in November 2022 at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer Annual Meeting. These initial data included a 40% disease control rate and 20% overall response rate in urothelial carcinoma patients who received IK-175 in combination with nivolumab, with the majority of combination patients experiencing reduction in their target lesions. The study is ongoing, and we plan to share updates from the program in 2023.
Our Strategy
We are dedicated to bringing next generation targeted oncology therapies to cancer patients. In order to achieve this goal, we will continue to rely on our deep understanding of complex biologic pathways, multi-modality drug discovery, structure-guided and computer-aided drug design, experience and skills in drugging novel and previously intractable targets, and robust biomarker-driven translational research informing clinical development. Our current pipeline consists of programs based entirely on internally discovered compounds from our robust research efforts. The key components of our current strategy are as follows:
•Continue to advance IK-930 through clinical development as both a monotherapy and in combination with other targeted agents. We are developing IK-930, an oral, paralog-selective small molecule inhibitor of TEAD, to evaluate its potential to bring therapeutic benefit to patients. We plan to continue advancing the ongoing monotherapy Phase 1 clinical trial of IK-930 in tumors harboring genetic mutations in the Hippo signaling pathway. Our clinical development strategy is designed to achieve clinical proof-of-concept in genetically defined subsets of solid tumors where significant unmet medical need exists and to leverage the potential for fast-to-market opportunities in orphan indications. In addition, we plan to evaluate the combination of IK-930 with other targeted therapies to address therapeutic resistance, including EGFR inhibitors and inhibitors in the RAS pathway. The first of these planned combinations is supported by our clinical supply collaboration with AstraZeneca evaluating IK-930 impact on osimertinib resistance in EGFR mutated cancers. 
 •Advance IK-595 to IND and the clinic. Our most recent development candidate, IK-595, is a dual MEK-RAF complex inhibitor designed to trap MEK and RAF in an inactive complex, thereby more completely inhibiting RAS signals than existing inhibitors. We plan to advance IK-595 rapidly towards the clinic to evaluate its potential best-in-class capabilities and differentiation for patients. IK-595 is being developed as an oral therapy, with a half-life designed to enable pharmacokinetic profile that we believe has the potential to lead to an optimal therapeutic window for patients relative to other agents in this class.
 •Continue to progress our research in both the Hippo pathway and RAS pathway towards identification of additional potential development candidates and furthering our leadership in the space. We have a robust discovery effort ongoing towards identifying opportunities for targeted oncology pipeline growth, including additional work within the Hippo and RAS pathways. This work, which resulted in IK-595’s selection as a development candidate, currently includes targeting multiple nodes in the RAS pathway. Our research team is also dedicated to generating additional data to further our knowledge in the both the RAS and Hippo spaces as our current programs continue to evolve and novel approaches to targeting the pathways emerge.

•Continue advancing IK-175 by generating additional clinical data in urothelial carcinoma. IK-175 is being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial as a monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab in urothelial carcinoma. In November 2022, we presented initial clinical data at the Society for Immunotherapy and Cancer Conference and showed encouraging anti-tumor activity. The study is ongoing and we plan to provide clinical updates in 2023. If Bristol Myers Squibb exercises their option to exclusively license IK-175, we would receive $50 million in opt-in fees, which would provide a meaningful source of non-dilutive capital. Additionally, we would be eligible to receive up to $450 million in clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments and royalties on worldwide net sales.
 •Maximize the value of our pipeline through continued discovery efforts and growth; generate a pipeline of programs supported by robust translational research and designed for biomarker-defined patient populations. Our internal discovery engine has resulted in the three candidates we are currently advancing in clinical trials. As we seek to expand our targeted oncology pipeline and advance it through proof-of-concept clinical trials, we plan to continue building a fully integrated biotechnology company. As we grow, we plan to advance programs that fit with our philosophy of patient-focused development by identifying biomarker-defined populations with significant unmet need that can benefit from targeted therapeutics. We hold worldwide development and commercial rights to our targeted oncology programs, and we intend to continue to develop our capabilities in late-stage clinical development and commercialization to maximize the potential value of these programs. As we continue to build the Company, we remain open to partnering opportunities in which we can leverage our expertise in drug discovery and development that add value to the Company and our stakeholders. 

Our Programs
Targeted Oncology Programs
Our targeted oncology discovery efforts include programs that target the Hippo and RAS pathways, emphasizing our philosophy of designing treatments tailored for specific patient populations identified through the genetic makeup of their tumors. Our pipeline is built on the Hippo and RAS oncosignaling network, where nodes are often connected through orthogonal mechanisms and compensatory pathways.
As a result of working within these interconnected signaling networks, our targeted oncology programs are designed to address multiple patient populations. First, they are designed to serve patient populations with genetically defined tumors by targeting mutations in the oncogenic pathways that drive their cancers. Second, they aim to address patient populations in which the target is involved in therapeutic resistance to other targeted therapies.


IK-930, a TEAD inhibitor
IK-930 is an internally discovered, oral, paralog-selective, small molecule inhibitor of a TEAD transcription factor. TEAD functions as the ultimate step in the Hippo signal transduction pathway by driving expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and survival. TEAD consists of a family of four paralogs and IK-930 is designed to selectively inhibit one of these isoforms that we believe has the potential to achieve efficacy and balance potential kidney toxicity associated with TEAD inhibition. The Hippo pathway is widely accepted as a key and prevalent driver of cancer pathogenesis and is genetically altered in approximately 10% of all human cancers. Such genetic alterations are often associated with poor clinical outcomes. The involvement of the Hippo pathway in mechanisms of resistance to other targeted therapies has been well established; the pathway is implicated in resistance to EGFR inhibitors, MEK inhibitors, and others.
 IK-930 is a novel inhibitor of TEAD that exploits a recently discovered and promising binding pocket on TEAD to enable the inhibitory effect upon the Hippo pathway. TEAD activity is dependent on binding of the fatty acid palmitate to a central lipid pocket.
IK-930 blocks palmitate from binding TEAD, thereby disrupting TEAD-dependent gene transcription. The mechanism of action of IK-930 is differentiated from historically unsuccessful attempts using either small molecules or cyclic peptides. Using structural biology-guided chemistry, we were able to generate novel TEAD inhibitor compounds across several chemical series directed to this binding pocket in TEAD and profile them using various in vitro and in vivo assays assessing potency, selectivity, tolerability, and antitumor activity. In addition, considering the potential on-target kidney toxicities associated with the Hippo pathway, it was important to design IK-930 to be paralog-selective in order to drive optimal antitumor activity, while significantly reducing the dose-limiting effects of kidney toxicity. By selecting IK-930 based upon these characteristics, we believe IK-930 has the potential to bring differentiated therapeutic benefit to patients with tumors harboring genetic mutations and alterations in the Hippo signaling pathway. Moreover, activation of the Hippo pathway confers resistance to certain targeted therapies, such as EGFR inhibitors and MEK inhibitors, which supports the potential for IK-930 to be combined with these therapies to overcome therapeutic resistance.
 We are currently evaluating IK-930 in a first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial as a monotherapy. The study aims to evaluate the safety and preliminary antitumor activity of IK-930 in Hippo-mutated cancers in orphan indications such as NF2-deficient malignant pleural mesothelioma and EHE, a rare type of vascular sarcoma. The FDA granted IK-930 both orphan and fast-track designation for the treatment mesothelioma in the first half of 2022. In addition, we plan to evaluate IK-930 in combination with multiple other targeted agents, with the aim of potentially addressing therapeutic resistance in more prevalent tumor indications characterized by genetic alterations. The first planned combination is IK-930 with osimertinib for patients with EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”). The Phase 1 clinical trial is currently advancing in monotherapy dose escalation as expected, with multiple dose cohorts cleared.
Role of the Hippo pathway and TEAD in oncology
The Hippo pathway is a highly conserved developmental signaling pathway that modulates the regulation of multiple biological processes, including cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, organ size, and tissue homeostasis. Dysregulation of the Hippo pathway is associated with the induction of hyperproliferation, cellular invasion, metastasis, cancer cell maintenance, and therapeutic resistance, and has been linked to other pro-tumorigenic activities, such as activation of regulatory T cells.
The Hippo signaling cascade begins with NF2, a gene that encodes the scaffold protein merlin, which links multiple extracellular cues to an intracellular signaling cascade. Merlin activates the kinases MST1 and MST2 (“MST1/2”) which subsequently phosphorylate and activate the kinases LATS1 and LATS2 (“LATS1/2”). LATS1/2 phosphorylates two key transcriptional coactivators of TEAD: YAP1 and TAZ. When phosphorylated, YAP1 and TAZ are sequestered to the cytoplasm where they are targeted for proteasome-mediated degradation. When the upstream portion of the signaling cascade is inactivated through normal regulation or through inactivating mutations, YAP1 and TAZ are not phosphorylated and can shuttle into the nucleus. Once inside the nucleus, YAP1 and TAZ bind TEAD to enable the transcription of TEAD target genes.
The Hippo Pathway

Nuclear YAP1 was observed to lead to increased TEAD activity as measured by higher levels of TEAD gene transcription. Data suggest that the addition of a TEAD inhibitor to an EGFR inhibitor regimen in patients with EGFR resistant tumors may be able to overcome therapeutic resistance to EGFR inhibition. In addition to resistance to EGFR targeting, there are emerging data indicating the Hippo pathway is involved in resistance to other targeted therapies as well, including MEK inhibition inhibitors in BRAF and RAS mutated cancers.
Two Clinical Strategies for IK-930 to Address Multiple Cancer Patient Populations
 
The monotherapy and combination approaches represent two distinct therapeutic strategies. Genetic alterations in the Hippo pathway that drive primary cancers provide a potential opportunity for IK-930 as a monotherapy. Separately, the role of the pathway in therapeutic resistance could open a wide range of patient populations that could benefit from IK-930, including EGFR mutant and KRAS mutant cancers.
Epidemiology of Hippo pathway driven cancers; monotherapy strategy
Published literature suggests that approximately 10% of all solid tumors present with dysregulated Hippo pathway and subsequent activation of TEAD, representing the populations that could potentially benefit from a monotherapy approach with IK-930. Dysregulation can occur at multiple nodes within the pathway. For example, the tumor suppressor gene NF2 can undergo inactivating mutations or YAP1 and TAZ can undergo gene fusion or amplification. These genetic alterations lead to tumor formation in mouse models and therefore are believed to be genetic drivers of cancer.
Based on available epidemiological data, we estimate that approximately 125,000 newly diagnosed cancer patients annually within the United States have tumors which harbor genetic alterations in the Hippo pathway, based on the incidence of cancers with YAP1 and TAZ gene amplification or fusion, as well as NF2 loss.
The figure below illustrates the incidence of individuals with newly diagnosed cancers that harbor Hippo pathway genetic alterations in the United States on an annual basis.
Incidence of Hippo Pathway Genetic Alterations


Genetic alterations in the Hippo pathway are present in diverse cancer types but there are certain cancers, including more prevalent indications, such as lung squamous cell carcinoma, and rarer indications, such as mesothelioma and sarcoma, which are reported to have a particularly high incidence of genetic alterations in the Hippo pathway, where alterations are considered to drive tumor formation and growth, and are associated with a poor patient prognosis:
•Loss of function mutations in NF2 are found in approximately 40% of cases of malignant mesothelioma and are associated with poor prognosis, including a significantly shorter progression free survival and overall survival. IK-930 has orphan designation for the treatment of mesothelioma. 
 •All cases of EHE a form of soft tissue sarcomas have YAP1 and TAZ gene fusions, where 90% of patients have TAZ-CAMTA1 fusions and the remaining 10% have YAP1-TFE3 fusions, which are directly linked to the etiology of these cancers. The disease is defined by the presence of one of these alterations. 
 •Meningiomas also exhibit a high frequency of NF2 deficiency accounting for approximately one-third of primary central nervous system (“CNS”) tumors.
 •Other solid tumors have exhibited Hippo pathways alteration, including in squamous lung cancer, where YAP1 and TAZ amplifications are found in approximately 6% and 29%, respectively, based on internal analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (“TCGA”) using the Genome Data Commons and cBioportal tools. 
 As part of our translational strategy, we have conducted bioinformatics analyses of the genomic and transcription profiles of cancer patients, broadening our understanding of the pathway's role in certain cancers, and supporting our indication selection and clinical development plan.
Results of Genetic Analysis of Indications with Hippo Alterations
 

We conducted genetic (top image) and transcriptional analysis (bottom image) of Hippo pathway dependency that identified a common subset of cancers. The data show the results from the genetic analysis of Hippo pathway alterations and the transcription analysis of YAP/TAZ activation. The overlapping cancer types present as indications with high potential for impact through Hippo pathway inhibition. For example, mesothelioma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancers demonstrate high frequencies of Hippo pathway alterations as well as high YAP/TAZ activity scores.

Hippo-implicated mechanisms of therapeutic resistance; combination strategy
Beyond the role of certain Hippo pathway alterations in driving cancer, several pathway components are known to drive resistance to targeted therapies such as EGFR inhibitors, including osimertinib. Approximately 30% of patients with NSCLC will have EGFR mutations. Osimertinib (Tagrisso) is an EGFR inhibitor approved for the first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC whose tumors have certain EGFR mutations. Despite the robust clinical activity exerted by osimertinib, patients often develop resistance to this treatment, which poses a significant challenge due to the scarcity of post-osimertinib pharmacological options available to date. A 2019 publication (Leonetti, et al., Br J Cancer, 2019) on EGFR resistance, reported a lack of actionable mutations for 40-50% of first-line osimertinib resistance patients. This is a population in which the Hippo pathway may be conferring resistance.
Resistance Mechanisms to First Line Osimertinib
 

Leonetti, et al., Br J Cancer, 2019
 We believe this population represents a substantial opportunity for TEAD inhibitors. Published data (Lee, et al., BBRC, 2016) from patient tumor samples shows that, upon acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors, there is an increase in nuclear YAP1 in tumors as compared to tumors collected prior to EGFR inhibitor treatment. In EGFR mutant lung cancer cell lines in vitro, the increase in nuclear YAP1 was observed to lead to increased TEAD activity as measured by higher levels of TEAD gene transcription.

Lee, et al., BBRC, 2016
 In EGFR mutant lung cancer cell lines in vitro, osimertinib leads to increased nuclear YAP1 and activation of TEAD dependent gene expression which can be inhibited by IK-930. In addition, IK-930 combined with osimertinib significantly increased the incidence of apoptosis in vitro and anti-tumor activity in mouse xenograft studies in EGFR mutant lung cancer cells. These data suggest that the addition of a TEAD inhibitor to an EGFR inhibitor regimen in patients with EGFR resistant tumors may be able to overcome therapeutic resistance to EGFR inhibition. In addition to EGFR resistance, additional information is emerging from newly marketed and later stage clinical development targeted oncology programs, including suggested resistance to MEK inhibitors. We have generated preclinical data supporting our belief of the clinical opportunity to treat patients with multiple types of genetically-defined tumors and tumors with resistance to other targeted therapies with IK-930.
Disease Overview
The epidemiology findings in mesothelioma, EHE, soft tissue sarcomas, as well as other solid tumors, including meningioma, point to the critical role of the Hippo pathway in tumor formation. In addition to the strong biological rationale for pursuing development of IK-930 in these cancers, we believe that these are areas of high unmet medical need in which IK-930 has the potential to provide meaningful clinical benefit to patients.
Monotherapy Opportunities
•Malignant mesothelioma is a rare cancer in the tissue lining the lungs and is a very aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis. After initial diagnosis, patients are reported to have a median life expectancy of 15 months. Approximately 3,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with mesothelioma each year. On average, about 2,500 mesothelioma-related deaths occur in the United States each year. There are few effective treatment options for advanced unresectable malignant mesothelioma and to date only two treatments have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of this condition. The combination of cisplatin and pemetrexed was the first systemic treatment approved by the FDA in 2004, followed only by the May 2020 FDA approval of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab. Even with this newly approved treatment, the median overall survival of these patients is 18 months, with most of the patients eventually progressing and dying from their disease. IK-930 has orphan designation for the treatment of mesothelioma. Approximately 40% of malignant mesothelioma patients are associated with NF2 deficiency and this genetic alteration has been described to contribute to asbestos-induced mesotheliomagenesis in animal models, showing that NF2 drives the malignant behavior of this subset of mesothelioma cases. 
 •In addition to mesothelioma, meningioma also has high frequency of NF2 deficiency. Meningioma is the most common CNS tumor, accounting for approximately one-third of primary CNS tumors. Surgery and/or radiation therapy (“RT”) constitute the initial therapeutic approach for meningiomas. Furthermore, surgery and/or RT can control disease in some patients with recurrence. Unfortunately, despite the appropriate use of surgery and RT for initial disease management and management of recurrent disease, there is a subset of patients in whom disease cannot be controlled with local approaches. Experience with systemic treatments is limited and although several agents have been studied, none have an established role in prolonging progression-free survival or overall survival. The outcome of this subset of patients with persistent or recurrent meningiomas continue to be poor, underscoring the substantial need for new therapies. 
 •Soft tissue sarcomas (“STS”) represent a rare and heterogeneous group of solid tumors derived from mesenchymal progenitor cells and characterized by a variety of genetic alterations. Recent molecular and genetic studies in large cohorts of STS cases have demonstrated an essential role of YAP1/TAZ in sarcomagenesis, implying that a YAP1/TAZ directed therapeutic approach could represent a rational strategy in a selected subgroup of these tumors. STS account for 1% of all adult malignancies. While the clinical outcome of these diseases has improved in the last decade with the use of anthracycline-based chemotherapy and the introduction of novel therapies targeting different cell pathways and the use of immune checkpoints, the prognosis for a significant subgroup of patients with STS is still poor and there is an unmet medical need for these patients. For these reasons, the identification of novel molecular targets is important in these rare malignancies. Recent studies in a large cohort of STS tumors showed that myxoid liposarcomas, synovial sarcomas and angiosarcomas, in addition to EHE, expressed the highest levels of YAP1/TAZ gene expression, potentially driving tumorigenesis in these subsets of STS.
 •EHE is a rare STS that grows from the cells that make up the lining of blood vessels with an incidence of one case per million people in which 100% of the cases harbor genetic alterations of Hippo pathway with approximately 90% of the cases harboring a genetic fusion between TAZ and CAMTA1(“TAZ-CAMTA1”) and the other 10% of cases harboring a genetic fusion between YAP1 and TFE3 (“YAP1-TFE3”). This cancer can occur anywhere in the body with the most common sites being the liver, lungs, and bone. It usually occurs in people between 30 and 50 years of age but can occur in young children and older people. Surgery and radiotherapy have been used as treatment for localized disease and several interventions have been used with palliative intent in the recurrent or metastatic cases, including steroids, interferon, and others, but there is currently no specific targeted therapy approved for the treatment of advanced EHE. 
Combination Therapy Opportunities
 •Despite the successful expansion of personalized oncology using targeted therapies to selectively treat patients with specific mutations in key oncogenic drivers, intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted agents is a growing clinical problem. Activation of YAP1/TAZ has been associated with the development of resistance to various targeted agents, including in EGFR mutant NSCLC, and in KRAS mutant tumors such as pancreatic carcinoma, CRC, and NSCLC. In EGFR mutant NSCLC, the successful early use of 3rd generation anti-EGFR inhibitors has improved the clinical outcome for these patients in not only in first line metastatic disease, but also early disease, and has become a new therapeutic paradigm for this patient population. However, the most efficient approach to managing emerging resistance to early use of 3rd generation EGFR inhibitors remains to be determined. 
Our Solution, IK-930
IK-930 is an oral, paralog-selective, small molecule inhibitor of TEAD that binds to a recently discovered lipid binding pocket on TEAD itself. TEAD activity is dependent on binding of the fatty acid palmitate to a central lipid pocket. IK-930 blocks palmitate from binding TEAD, thereby disrupting TEAD-dependent gene transcription. The mechanism of action of IK-930 is differentiated from historically unsuccessful attempts in targeting the pathway. We believe that targeting the lipid binding pocket of TEAD has the potential to yield more potent and selective molecules as compared to these historical attempts.
We are currently conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial of IK-930 in multiple tumor types, including cancers with high frequencies of Hippo pathway alterations. In addition to primary cancers linked to the pathway we plan to evaluate combinations with IK-930 in patients with the potential for acquired resistance to other targeted therapies, the first of which will explore IK-930 in combination with osimertinib. We expect to share initial clinical data from the monotherapy program in the second half of 2023.
We have generated a robust preclinical dataset supporting IK-930 as a potential monotherapy solution for Hippo altered cancers and in combination to combat therapeutic resistance. In addition, our in-depth translational work coupled with our clinical development strategy positions us to select patients most likely to benefit from TEAD inhibition.
 Based on our preclinical studies, we believe IK-930 is a potent, well tolerated, and selective TEAD inhibitor with favorable pharmacologic properties. The pharmacological properties we have observed have aided in determining our dose-escalation strategy in our clinical program.
 In a TEAD reporter cell line, IK-930 inhibited TEAD-dependent transcription with an EC50 of 25 nM, and inhibited proliferation of H226 cells, an NF2 mutant mesothelioma cell line, with an EC50 of 21 nM, demonstrating that IK-930 has high potency in inhibiting activated Hippo signaling in cultured cancer cells.
The figure below illustrates the inhibition of TEAD by IK-930.
Inhibition of TEAD by IK-930 blocks TEAD-Dependent Transcription and Proliferation in H226 Cells Containing an NF2 Mutation
 

The ability of IK-930 to selectively inhibit proliferation in Hippo pathway mutated cells was demonstrated in the H28 mesothelioma cell line, which does not have any Hippo pathway mutations. This cell line is insensitive to IK-930. However, knockdown of NF2 using CAS9-CRISPR converts H28 into an IK-930 sensitive tumor.
The figure below illustrates IK-930 blocking the proliferation of cells with NF2 loss but not in cells with normal NF2.
IK-930 Blocks Proliferation in Cells with NF2 Loss but Not in Cells with Normal NF2


The ability of IK-930 to specifically inhibit TEAD mediated transcription was also demonstrated in the NF2 mutant (TEAD active) H226 mesothelioma cell line. Cells were treated in triplicates with IK-930 or DMSO control for 24 hours, then, RNA was extracted and sequenced. The expression levels of six TEAD target genes were compared between DMSO and IK-930 as represented in the heatmap below. IK-930 resulted in lower level of TEAD-target gene expression (green) compared to DMSO (red) consistent with inhibition of TEAD activity.
 We developed the six gene TEAD signature shown on the heatmap below through a combination of literature curation and experimental characterization using proprietary datasets from RNA sequencing experiments in mesothelioma, NSCLC, and HNSCC cell lines and mouse xenografts mesothelioma treated with DMSO control or IK-930.
 Robust Inhibition of TEAD Target Gene Expression
 
We conducted multiple studies evaluating IK-930 in preclinical animal models. We observed IK-930 exhibited antitumor activity in three in vivo xenografts models with different genetic alterations leading to constitutively active TEAD transcription status: NCI-H226 (NF2 deficient mesothelioma), MSTO2H11(LATS1/LATS2 mutant mesothelioma) and Detroit 562 (YAP1 amplified head and neck cancer). These studies were conducted utilizing 6-8 animals per group and in all models IK-930 dosed animals experienced increased
tumor growth inhibition compared to vehicle. These studies demonstrated IK-930 antitumor activity in tumors driven by Hippo pathway signaling (constitutive TEAD activity).
 Antitumor Activity of IK-930 in Hippo Mutant Xenograft Models

 In addition to potential for single agent activity in tumors with genetic alterations in the Hippo pathway, we believe there is an opportunity for IK-930 to be beneficial in combination with other targeted therapies in the therapeutic resistance setting. Alterations in the Hippo pathway have been connected to post-targeted treatment tumor growth or recurrence. For example, YAP1 activation (nuclear localization) has been shown to drive resistance to EGFR targeted therapies. NSCLC patients who develop resistance to EGFR inhibitors have higher levels of nuclear YAP expression in their tumors compared to baseline.
We also conducted studies to evaluate the mechanism by which IK-930 can prevent the expansion of EGFR inhibition tolerant persister cells. These data demonstrate the potential for the combination of IK-930 with osimertinib to delay emergence of resistance to EGFR inhibition, and may further impact the residual disease state prolonging the duration of osimertinib clinical benefit.
Upon high dose osimertinib treatment, most EGFR mutant PC9 cells experienced apoptosis; however, a small subset of drug-tolerant cells, called persisters, were able to survive and continue to proliferate in the chronic presence of osimertinib. The addition of IK-930, concurrently with osimertinib, or after the emergence of the osimertinib-tolerant persister population, led to a clear reduction in the number of persister cells. These data demonstrate IK-930 treatment effectively prevented the survival and expansion of osimertinib-tolerant persister cells. This highlights IK-930’s potential as a combination agent in preventing and reversing therapeutic resistance.
Persister Cell Emergence Mechanism

IK-930 Addition after Persister Emergence Attenuated Expansion

In addition to these data that highlight the clinical opportunity to treat EGFR resistant patients with IK-930, we observed in vitro that inhibitors of EGFR promote YAP1 nuclear localization in EGFR mutant NSCLC cells, which led to an induction of TEAD-dependent gene expression. We observed that IK-930 was able to suppress osimertinib-induced TEAD-dependent gene expression and to significantly enhance apoptosis when combined with osimertinib in EGFR mutant tumors grown in vitro. In addition, we observed significantly enhanced antitumor activity when IK-930 was combined with osimertinib in multiple EGFR mutant tumors grown in vivo. For example, in the H1975 EGFR mutant lung cancer xenograft mouse model, there was meaningful tumor growth inhibition in the group treated with IK-930 in combination with osimertinib, as well as complete regressions in the group treated with IK-930 in combination with osimertinib and trametinib, a MEK inhibitor, supporting that shutting down the mitogen-activated protein kinase (“MAPK”) survival pathway further leads to antitumor activity.
The figure below illustrates in vitro apoptosis (left) and in vivo antitumor activity (right) in EGFR mutant lung cancer models treated with osimertinib, IK-930, or the combination.
 IK-930 in EGFR Mutant Lung Cancer

A clinical supply collaboration with AstraZeneca is in place for osimertinib for evaluation in combination with IK-930 for patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC in our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial, assessing IK-930’s impact on EGFR resistance.
We also conducted studies in several tumor models of KRAS-mutant cancers assessing the combination of IK-930 with trametinib. RAS-mutant cancer patients with resistance to MEK inhibitors could represent additional patient populations that could benefit from IK-930 combination therapy. There are multiple MEK inhibitors available and in development, including our own dual MEK-RAF inhibitor, IK-595. These studies were conducted with one of the most widely used approved MEK inhibitors, trametinib. In two models of KRAS G13D mutant cancers, HCT116 and LoVo, IK-930 combined with trametinib demonstrated more robust anti-tumor activity than either single agent alone.

     In a mouse model of KRAS G12S mutant cancers, A549, a combination of IK-930 with trametinib, showed significant impact on tumor inhibition.

IK-930 Combination with Trametinib in KRAS G12S NSCLC Model
 

Importantly, in all three of these models, IK-930 added activity only when treatment with trametinib was present, suggesting the resistance of the tumor is linked to the Hippo pathway and could benefit from TEAD inhibition. These data support studying IK-930 in combination with targeted therapies in multiple tumor types, including EGFR and KRAS mutant tumors.
 IK-930 clinical development strategy
Given the broad role of the Hippo signaling pathway on tumor biology and cancer progression, our development plan for IK-930 monotherapy is focused on biomarker selected patient populations based on NF2 loss, and/or YAP1 and TAZ gene fusion in patients with solid tumors. We plan to utilize a comprehensive clinical development strategy focused on genetically defined patient populations targeting orphan disease indications of high unmet medical need.
Our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of IK-930 is exploring IK-930 as a monotherapy and is currently in dose escalation. The initial monotherapy arm of the trial is evaluating the safety and activity of IK-930 in rare and orphan tumors associated with specific genetic alterations such as NF2 loss. The clinical trial is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended Phase 2 dose as illustrated in the figure below. Currently, we are enrolling the monotherapy dose escalation cohorts with patients with tumors known to have high incidence of Hippo pathway alterations and are advancing as expected, with multiple dose cohorts cleared.
The monotherapy dose expansion is planned to include multiple cohorts and select patients prospectively based on specific Hippo genetic alterations, such as NF2 loss and/or YAP1 and TAZ gene fusion.
Phase 1 Clinical Trial of IK-930; Monotherapy Clinical Trial Design
 
Combination cohorts of other targeted therapies with IK-930 present additional development opportunities, including the cohort in combination with osimertinib for patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC to assess IK-930’s impact on therapeutic resistance to EGFR inhibition. This strategy is based on a distinct non-genetic mechanism from the monotherapy approach in genetically altered cancers. In addition to EGFR mutant cancers, there are multiple potential therapeutic combinations, including MEK inhibitors in patients with RAS mutant cancers, that we are considering.

Initial clinical data from the monotherapy dose escalation cohorts is expected in the second half of 2023.
IK-595, a dual MEK-RAF inhibitor
 Targeting in the RAS pathway and MEK inhibition in cancer
 The RAS pathway is implicated in at least half a million new cancer diagnoses each year in the United States alone. Ten of the twenty most common cancers worldwide are associated with RAS pathway mutations, representing a major unmet need for new and innovative approaches in the pathway.
 10 of the 20 Most Common Cancers Worldwide are Associated with RAS Pathway Mutations
 
Cox. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery (2014); World Cancer Research Fund International
 We aim to target the RAS pathway on multiple levels, including preventing known resistance mechanisms, to achieve deep and sustained responses. Our most recent development candidate and first in the RAS pathway, IK-595, is a dual MEK-RAF inhibitor that is designed to trap MEK and RAF in an inactive complex. The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK cascade MAPK pathway regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Activating mutations in this pathway are known to drive tumorigenesis in a large number of patient populations. Targeting MEK and RAF has the potential to impact patients across a plethora of indications, including RAS and RAF-altered cancers, both in targeting genetic mutations and in targeting escape mechanisms from other targeted therapies, potentially prolonging duration of response for patients.


Existing drugs targeting MEK, classified as kinase inhibitors, are limited by insufficient pathway inhibition and narrow therapeutic window, and are only currently addressing BRAF type I mutant cancer patients and NF1 mutant neurofibroma patients. One of the well-known mechanisms of resistance to existing MEK inhibitors in RAS mutant populations is through CRAF bypass, the reactivation of CRAF through ERK mediated negative feedback control. More recently, CRAF function independent of its kinase activity has also been reported to drive tumor growth, a function that is not addressable through kinase inhibitors, including selective or pan-RAF inhibitors. We believe these two important CRAF roles in tumorigenesis and therapeutic resistance are significant factors in why existing MEK inhibitors, including the four FDA approved therapies, are insufficient for serving the large patient populations with RAS or RAF gene alterations.


In addition to the approved MEK inhibitors, there are several in development. In many of our preclinical studies, we compared IK-595 to both approved MEK inhibitors and other experimental MEK inhibitors, including avutometinib (“VS-6766”), Verastem’s clinical-stage MEK-RAF inhibitor, as a representative of the class of competitor molecules in development. We believe IK-595 has advantages over the class of MEK inhibitors as it could provide broader, more durable antitumor activity and a better therapeutic window for patients.

Our Solution, IK-595
 IK-595 is a potent, oral, small molecule MEK-RAF complex inhibitor that is designed to more comprehensively inhibit MAPK signaling than existing treatments, while achieving a broader therapeutic window for patients. Through its ability to stabilize MEK-RAF interaction, including CRAF, IK-595 aims to prevent both CRAF bypass and kinase-independent CRAF activity.


IK-595 is being developed as an oral therapy, with mechanistic differentiation and a pharmacokinetic profile potentially superior to available inhibitors and those in development, with the potential for an improved therapeutic window for patients. We plan to submit an IND for IK-595 to the FDA in the second half of 2023.
 We have generated a robust preclinical dataset supporting IK-595 as a potentially durable therapeutic solution for multiple cancer types linked to the RAS pathway, expanding the potential populations that could benefit from existing MEK inhibitors. These studies demonstrate and include:
 •Potent inhibition capabilities of IK-595 through multiple biochemical and cellular potency assays
 •IK-595 ability to stabilize MEK and RAF, including CRAF, which we believe is key to differentiation in the class; 
 •IK-595 inhibition of phosphorylation, and thus subsequent activation, of MEK and ERK (pMEK and pERK)
 •Durability of the inhibition of pERK, and downstream target gene expression
 •IK-595 preclinical efficacy in RAS and RAF altered cancer cell lines 
 •Potential synergy of IK-595 in combination with other targeted therapies in vitro, including in combination with KRAS G12C inhibitors, EGFR, PI3K, SHP2, and SOS1 inhibitors
 •Projected pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of IK-595, which has been designed to have shorter half life in humans to allow for potentially differentiated dosing strategies 

IK-595 demonstrated high potency in a variety of biochemical and cellular assays. IK-595 biochemically inhibits unphosphorylated MEK (uMEK). Additionally, in AsPC-1 cells, IK-595 potently blocks cell proliferation and the phosphorylation of ERK and MEK.
 

We measured IK-595’s effect on the MEK-CRAF interaction in KRAS mutant cancer cells (HCT-116). Western blot quantification of the MEK immunoprecipitates from HCT116 cells illustrates that IK-595 strongly increased the association of endogenous MEK and CRAF proteins, whereas trametinib decreased the MEK-CRAF interaction, and trametiglue had no effect. VS-6766 also increased MEK-CRAF association, but to a significantly less extent. These data indicate that IK-595 is differentiated from other MEK inhibitors in its potential to stabilize the MEK-CRAF complex.
 A similar data trend was seen with MEK-BRAF association. These data indicate that IK-595 is differentiated from other MEK inhibitors in its ability to stabilize the MEK-CRAF in a completely inactive complex.


The effect of IK-595 on MEK phosphorylation was measured in KRAS mutant AsPC1 cells, using a Mesoscale Discovery (“MSD”) kit detecting total and phosphorylated MEK. In AsPC-1 cells after 4 hours of treatment, IK-595 potently inhibited MEK phosphorylation with an IC50 of 0.6 nM, while VS-6766 was more than 10 fold less potent with an IC50 of 7 nM. Trametinib had little effect on MEK phosphorylation.



We assessed levels of phosphorylated and total MEK following 4- and 48-hours of treatment of HCT-116 cells with IK-595 compared to seven other MEK inhibitors, displayed below by Western blot analysis. IK-595 was observed to completely block phosphorylation of MEK at both 4 and 48 hours. VS-6766 and trametiglue were also observed to block the phosphorylation of MEK at both 4 and 48 hours. Trametinib had minimal or no effect on MEK phosphorylation at either timepoint, whereas 1st generation MEK inhibitors, namely mirdametinib, binimetinib, selumetinib, and cobimetinib, significantly increased MEK phosphorylation at both 4 and 48 hours. This suggests that IK-595 not only inhibits MEK protein, but also induces an inactive conformation of MEK-RAF protein complex to block RAF mediated MEK phosphorylation and activation.

We measured the ability of IK-595 to inhibit ERK phosphorylation as compared to trametinib and VS-6766 through multiple studies. Levels of phosphorylated and total ERK following the treatment of KRAS mutant AsPC-1 and NCI-H2122 cells as well as CRAF amplified 5637 cells for up to 72 hours with IK-595, trametinib, or VS-6766 were determined by Western blot analysis. IK-595 inhibited ERK phosphorylation for up to 48-72 hours, whereas a rebound in ERK phosphorylation was observed in trametinib and VS-6766 at as early as 12 hours. These data support our belief that IK-595 can achieve more durable inhibition than existing and competitor MEK inhibitors.

The antitumor activity of IK-595 was evaluated in vivo in multiple xenografts models, four of which are shown below having different RAS/MAPK alterations: AsPC-1 (KRAS G12D pancreatic); NCI-H2122 (KRAS G12C non-small cell lung cancer), 5637 (CRAF amplified bladder cancer) and OCI-AML-3 (NRAS Q61L acute myeloid leukemia model that is resistant to standard of care, venetolax). These studies were conducted utilizing 8-10 animals per group. Animals were dosed daily and tumors were measured twice weekly. These studies demonstrated IK-595’s robust antitumor activity in tumors driven by alterations in the RAS/MAPK pathway. Similar activity was demonstrated in the AsPC-1 model when IK-595 was dosed intermittently at 6 mg/kg every other day (QOD). In addition, in all models, body weight of the mice was maintained similarly to that of the vehicle group.


We measured the synergy of IK-595 with multiple potential combination agents. For each agent, we assessed the synergy of IK-595 in combination with the given agent in multiple cell lines, measure cell viability and calculated Loewe sum of synergy scores. IK-595 demonstrated significantly higher synergy score with AMG510 (sotorasib), a KRAS-G12C inhibitor, over trametinib and VS-6766. Additionally, IK-595 showed significant synergy with other KRAS-G12C inhibitors (adagrasib), as well as P13K, EGFR, SOS1, and SHP2 inhibitors.

IK-595 Synergy with Multiple Potential Combination Agents
 

A key consideration for next generation MEK inhibitors is to broaden the therapeutic window that allows for deep inhibition and anti-proliferation effect in cancer cells but give normal cells sufficient breaks in pathway inhibition to minimize toxic side-effects. In order to optimize for tolerability, trametinib and VS-6766’s clinical dosing regimens are designed to accommodate their very long half-lives in humans (trametinib 72-120 hours and VS-6766 60-100 hours). Because of this, clinical doses of trametinib and VS-6766 cannot reach concentrations above IC75 for pERK inhibition as assessed in KRAS mutant cancer cells, or below IC50 through the entire treatment duration, leading to insufficient antitumor efficacy and poor tolerability. We believe the predicted shorter human half life of IK-595 will allow for flexibility in dosing schedules and enable transient concentrations above IC90 and recovery in normal tissues during periods of low exposure, providing an advantageous therapeutic window for patients.

IK-595 Projected Dosing and Pharmacokinetics (Model Only)
 

These data combine to support our efforts to advance IK-595 for the treatment of multiple types of RAS and RAF altered cancers. We believe they also demonstrate IK-595’s competitive advantages over existing MEK inhibitors and others in development, including ability to trap CRAF in an inactive complex with MEK to avoid CRAF bypass and kinase-independent activity resulting in durable inhibition of the targets, as well as an improved therapeutic window.

IK-595 translational and clinical development strategy
 In planning for clinical development, we have assessed the sensitivity profile of IK-595 in a large number of cancer cell lines harboring different RAS and RAF gene alterations. We plan to initially conduct our clinical program in indications with high prevalence of mutations that demonstrate higher sensitivity to IK-595 and have potential reliance on CRAF function. The ability of IK-595 to inhibit cell proliferation was evaluated by a 5-day cell titer glo (“CTG”) assay in ~250 cell lines with genetic alterations that included KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, CRAF alterations, EGFR, PIK3CA, and PTEN mutations. Area under the curve (“AUC”) of percent inhibition dose response curves were graphed. IK-595 demonstrated increased sensitivity in NRAS and KRAS mutant as well as CRAF altered cell lines compared to RAS wild-type cell lines.
 

Our clinical development plan includes the identification and selection of novel indications that show unique sensitivity to IK-595 and may be less explored by other inhibitors in the RAS pathway. In addition to our assessment of IK-595 as a monotherapy in RAS and RAF altered cancers, we are developing a combination strategy that leverages our own pipeline and expertise, as well as partnerships with therapeutics in RAS-MAPK and other compensatory pathways in which MEK-RAF may be a mechanisms of resistance.
IK-595 is currently in IND-enabling studies and we plan to submit an IND for IK-595 to the FDA in the second half of 2023.
Immune Signaling Programs
 In addition to our programs targeting the RAS and Hippo pathways, we are also advancing programs that target immune-signaling pathways that modulate the TME. These programs, like our targeted oncology pipeline, are supported by robust biomarker research that allow us to prospectively select patients.
Two of our immune signaling programs, IK-175 and IK-412, are partnered with Bristol Myers Squibb. Through our strategic partnership, Bristol Myers Squibb has the exclusive right to license each of IK-175 and IK-412 through completion of Phase 1b clinical trials. IK-175 is an inhibitor of AHR and urothelial carcinoma patients are currently being evaluated in the expansion cohorts of the Phase 1 clinical trial, an indication that show high expression of AHR. IK-412 is an enzyme therapy designed to lower levels of immunosuppressive kynurenine in the TME. The IK-412 program experienced manufacturing delays previously disclosed in 2021. Considering these delays and the timeline of the partnership, we have made the strategic decision to pause IK-412 development for the remainder of the term of the Bristol Myers Squibb Collaboration Agreement (defined below) after the completion of on-going chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (“CMC”) activities, which concluded in 2022.
Our third candidate in immune signaling was IK-007, an oral selective antagonist of the EP4 receptor. IK-007 was evaluated in combination with pembrolizumab in a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (“MSS CRC”). In November 2022, we made the strategic decision to prioritize our targeted oncology pipeline and discontinued development of IK-007 in MSS CRC. In December 2022, we shared a clinical update on the program in which data concluded that IK-007 in combination
with pembrolizumab had a tolerable and predictable safety profile in MSS CRC. However, due to small sample sizes, correlation of clinical benefit with levels of PGEM, a metabolite in the EP4 pathway we identified as a biomarker, was inconclusive. The combination of IK-007 and pembrolizumab produced limited, but durable, antitumor activity that compares favorably with standard of care and checkpoint inhibitors alone. However, the trial did not reach predefined levels of antitumor activity to support further development in this indication. Investigator initiated programs with IK-007 continue.
IK-175, an AHR antagonist
IK-175 is a potent, selective oral antagonist of AHR. We observed evidence of antitumor activity of IK-175 as a monotherapy and in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody both in our preclinical models and more recently in initial clinical data presented from our ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial. Pursuant to our master collaboration agreement with Celgene Corporation (now Bristol Myers Squibb) we are responsible for development of IK-175 through the completion of a Phase 1b clinical trial, through the completion of which Bristol Myers Squibb has an exclusive right to exclusively license IK-175 worldwide. See “—License and Collaboration Agreements—Master Collaboration Agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb” for additional information.
Dual role of AHR in cancer progression
AHR is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that drives tumor progression through direct cancer cell and immunosuppressive effect in the TME. In some tumors, such as bladder cancer, high levels of AHR lead to constitutive, always-on activation and direct stimulation of tumor cell growth. AHR is also a critical component of a dominant immunosuppressive pathway in cancer, a pathway that modulates the function of cells in both the innate and adaptive components of the immune system. AHR is, in its inactive form, found in the cytosol, outside the nucleus. Upon binding of a signaling molecule or ligand, AHR migrates to the nucleus and functions as a transcription factor.
AHR is overexpressed and constitutively activated in a number of tumors, including, but not limited to, bladder cancer. Constitutive activation of AHR also has been reported in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, as well as castration-resistant prostate cancer. In melanoma, constitutive activation of AHR is believed to represent a significant mechanism of resistance to approved inhibitors of BRAF kinase. Inhibition of constitutively active AHR in patient-derived acute myeloid leukemia cells has been shown to sensitize these cells to killing by natural killer cells.
Bladder cancer overview
We prioritized patients with bladder cancer as a lead indication for the development of IK-175 based on the following:
•Poor prognosis of patients with bladder cancer is associated with a high AHR transcript profiling score; 
 •High levels of AHR mRNA and protein as measured by immunohistochemistry and RNAscope are found in bladder cancers; 
 •AHR amplifications have been described in approximately 5% to 22% of bladder cancer patients; and 
 •Nuclear localization of AHR is high in bladder cancers. 
 Bladder cancer is the most common malignancy involving the urinary system and there were an estimated 81,400 new cases of bladder cancer and 17,980 deaths in the United States in 2020. The five-year survival for patients with early-stage disease is 88%; however, for patients with metastatic disease or cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, the five-year survival drops to 5%.
The most common treatment for patients diagnosed with advanced or metastatic bladder cancer is chemotherapy with platinum-based drugs, such as carboplatin or cisplatin, in combination with gemcitabine. Patients with metastatic disease that progresses during or after platinum-based chemotherapy are increasingly being treated with checkpoint immunotherapy. A number of PD-1 and PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with refractory bladder cancer. Objective response rates in clinical trials with checkpoint inhibitors have generally been between 13% and 29%. The median overall survival of patients with advanced or metastatic bladder cancer from the start of initial therapy is 12.7 months. Other drugs have been recently approved for use in patients with metastatic bladder cancer after failure on platinum based regimens and checkpoint inhibitors, including Enfortumab vedotin and Sacituzumab govitecan (antibody directed conjugates “ADCs”). However, no approved treatment is available for bladder cancer patients who are resistant or refractory to checkpoint inhibitors. 
Our solution, IK-175
IK-175 is an internally discovered small molecule AHR antagonist that we are developing in collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb for the treatment of advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including urothelial carcinoma, the most common type of bladder cancer,
where AHR-activation is known to lead to poor prognoses. We observed that IK-175 is potent and selective for AHR in multiple in vitro assays and species.
We have an ongoing, open-label Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating IK-175 as a monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab. The dose-escalation cohorts enrolled locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor patients. In November 2022, we presented initial clinical data from the dose-escalation cohorts and the first stage of the expansion cohorts in urothelial carcinoma. The study is currently ongoing. Clinical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data supports once-daily clinical dosing in patients.
 IK-175 indication and patient selection strategy
 Our IK-175 clinical development strategy includes enrolling patients with cancers with a high expression of AHR, leading to our selection of bladder cancer and urothelial carcinoma. As part of our robust translational strategy, we have explored three tumor profiling technologies centered on AHR to help guide indication selection and/or candidate patients:
 •AHR gene amplification: Increases in the number of copies of the AHR gene as assessed by Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (“FISH”) are observed in over 5% of multiple cancers such as esophageal, bladder and lung cancers. 
 •Nuclear AHR positivity: Constitutive activation of AHR leads to its localization to the nucleus, which can be directly measured by a proprietary immunohistochemical staining assay that we developed. In the monotherapy expansion cohort, we are prospectively enriching for patients with tumors that exhibit activated AHR using this assay. With the proprietary assay we developed, we assessed multiple tumor samples and found bladder cancer has the highest percentage of nuclear AHR positivity of those sample test. Head and neck cancer, melanoma, and ovarian cancer also resulted in higher-than-average scores, as displayed in the image below. The assay also is being used in our ongoing clinical trial to select patients with high nuclear-AHR positivity. 
 Immunohistochemistry Tumor Microarray Results


AHR-dependent gene transcription: Activation of AHR leads to changes in transcription of many genes, which can be quantified by standard mRNA transcription profiling technologies. We discovered this gene transcription expression signature. We generated a profile of the transcriptional changes induced by AHR activation across a panel of cell lines. We then used this profile to score tumors based on available transcript profiling data in public databases. We found that bladder cancer patients with transcriptional profiles that scored highest using our activated AHR profile had poorer prognoses compared to those with low scores, as illustrated in the figure below.

  Poor Overall Survival in Bladder Cancer Patients


Ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial and initial clinical data
 We are currently evaluating IK-175 as a monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors and urothelial carcinoma, which accounts for over 90% of all bladder cancers, in an open-label Phase 1 clinical trial. Enrollment in the dose escalation completed and we advanced to the two-stage dose expansion, enrolling unresectable locally recurrent or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (dose expansion) who have exhausted prior standard of care therapies. Dose escalation ranged from 200-1200 mg QD and 800 mg BID (monotherapy) and 800 mg and 1200 mg QD (combination with nivolumab 480 mg q4w). Expansion cohorts used a Simon 2-stage design requiring at least 1 responder in stage 1 urothelial carcinoma patients to proceed to the second stage.
 Primary endpoints of the trial include safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose, and recommended phase 2 dose. Secondary endpoints include pharmacokinetics, overall response rate (“ORR”), duration of response (“DoR”) and additional, immune pharmacodynamic endpoints.
In November 2022, at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer Congress, we presented initial data on 43 patients from the dose escalation and stage 1 of the dose expansion. IK-175 was well tolerated with a predictable and manageable safety profile. Encouraging anti-tumor activity and duration of response was observed in the IK-175 nivolumab combination expansion cohort.

The data set included:
 •43 total patients; 40 evaluable for anti-tumor activity
 •20 dose escalation patients (15 monotherapy, 5 combination)
 •20 dose expansion urothelial carcinoma patients (10 monotherapy, 10 combination)
 The patients in the trial were all heavily pretreated, with all of the urothelial carcinoma patients having advanced on checkpoint inhibitors within 12 weeks of their last dose.

1-3 | 2 | 4 
4-10 | 8 | 6

A summary of the initial clinical data is described in the table below. The combination cohort demonstrated a 20% overall response rate and a 40% disease control rate (“DCR”).
 Summary of Initial Clinical Data from Stage 1 of Urothelial Carcinoma Expansion Cohorts
 

 | Monotherapy (n=10) | Combination (n=10)
Best overall response 
Confirmed partial response | 1(10%) | 2 (20%) 
Stable Disease | 1(10%) | 2 (20%) 
Progressive disease | 6(60%) | 6 (60%) 
ORR, n(%) | 1(10%) | 2 (20%) 
DCR, n(%) | 2 (20%) | 4 (40%) 

 
In addition to the encouraging statistical data, these initial data showed encouraging antitumor activity in both the monotherapy and nivolumab combination cohorts in patients that are refractory or resistant to check point inhibitors. These observations in both cohorts contribute to our confidence in IK-175 in combination with nivolumab as a potential therapy for urothelial carcinoma.
In the monotherapy dose expansion cohort, 20% of patients achieved disease control with one patient achieving a confirmed partial response with a duration of response at the time of the data cut-off of nearly 15 months.
Percent Δ in Sum of Diameters Over Time (Urothelial Carcinoma; IK-175 Monotherapy Dose Expansion)
 
The observed rate of progression of non-responders in this group suggests that patients in this population have rapidly advancing disease when a treatment does not have impact. In addition to the 40% DCR and 20% ORR in the combination expansion in urothelial carcinoma, we observed reduction in target lesion in the majority of the patients and duration of lesion reduction ranging from 4 to 8 months at the time of data presentation.
Percent Δ in Sum of Diameters Over Time (Urothelial Carcinoma; IK-175 Nivolumab Combination Dose Expansion)
 
These initial results demonstrate encouraging, durable, anti-tumor activity in stage 1 of both the monotherapy and combination arms in urothelial carcinoma patients. We believe these data are encouraging and the study is currently ongoing; we plan to provide a clinical update on the program in 2023. In addition to the program in urothelial carcinoma, we had initiated a Phase 1 program in head and neck cancer evaluating IK-175 in combination with nivolumab. Recently we made a decision to stop the head and neck study prior to enrolling any participants in order to direct resources towards completing the data package for the Bristol Myers Squibb partnership, which is eligible for opt-in until early 2024.
Efficient Early-Stage Research to Expand Targeted Oncology Portfolio
 Our discovery efforts have produced all three ongoing development programs in our pipeline. We believe we have a proven track record in discovery and development of novel therapeutic candidates, with a highly efficient process that has led to an average of less than three years from concept to IND, nearly half the industry average. Our discovery engine is built on early incorporation of translational and clinical input to ensure the work we do has specific patient needs in mind and real-life potential in the clinic.
Our Discovery Engine Utilizes Multiple Strategies in Parallel, Including Early Inclusion of Translational Medicine to Ensure Efficient Development
 
Across our early-stage program, we are conducting additional work in both the Hippo and RAS pathways in the effort to develop therapies for cancers that target key nodes and feedback connections. This work, coupled with the progress we have made with IK-930 and IK-595, and encouraging data from our partnered immune-oncology program, form our well-balanced pipeline.
Our Pipeline of Wholly-Owned Targeted Oncology Assets and
Advanced Partnered Immune Signaling Program
 
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid innovation of new technologies, fierce competition, and strong defense of intellectual property. While we believe that our pipeline and our knowledge, experience, and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions, among others.
We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and there are other companies focusing on structural biology-guided chemistry-based drug design to develop therapies in the fields of cancer and other diseases. These companies include divisions of large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies of various sizes. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with currently approved therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future from segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that pursue targeted oncology therapeutics. Key product features that would affect our ability to effectively compete with other therapeutics include the efficacy, safety, and convenience of our products.
We believe principal competitive factors to our business include, among other things, our ability to identify promising biomarkers, our ability to successfully transition research programs into clinical development, our ability to raise capital, and the scalability of our pipeline and business.
Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we may or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used and less costly or have a better safety profile than our products and these competitors may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products.
Furthermore, we also face competition more broadly across the market for cost-effective and reimbursable cancer treatments. The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted drug therapy or a combination of such methods. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While our product candidates, if any are approved, may compete with these existing drug and other therapies, to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our product candidates may not be competitive with them. Some of these drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products or specific branded products. We expect that if our product candidates are approved, they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic, including branded generic, products. As a result, obtaining market acceptance of, and gaining significant share of the market for, any of our product candidates that we successfully introduce to the market will pose challenges. In addition, many companies are developing new therapeutics, and we cannot predict what the standard of care will be as our product candidates progress through clinical development.
IK-930
Other companies that have publicly disclosed that they are developing TEAD inhibitors are: Vivace Therapeutics, Inc., Novartis International AG (Novartis), Inventiva S.A., Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd., SpringWorks Therapeutics, Inc., Cedilla Therapeutics, Inc., BridGene Biosceiences, Betta Pharmaceuticals, Beactica Therapeutics, Sporos Biodiscovery, Light Horse Therapeutics, Tasca Therapeutics, Orion Corporation, Merck, Sanofi, and Roche/Genentech. Vivace Therapeutics, Inc. and Novartis are both in Phase 1 clinical trials with their programs. All other programs are preclinical.

License and Collaboration Agreements
Master Collaboration Agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb
In January 2019, we entered into the Bristol Myers Squibb Collaboration Agreement with Celgene Corporation (which was acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb in November 2019) under which Bristol Myers Squibb may elect in its sole discretion to exclusively license rights to develop and commercialize compounds (and products and diagnostic products containing such compounds) that modulate the activity of two collaboration targets, kynurenine and AHR, excluding AHR agonists except for inverse agonists, or the Collaboration Candidates, which we are developing as IK-175 and IK-412. The Bristol Myers Squibb Collaboration Agreement triggered an upfront payment of $95.0 million, which consisted of approximately $80.5 million in cash and an equity investment of approximately $14.5 million for which we issued 14,545,450 shares of our Series A-1 Preferred Stock pursuant to a separate stock purchase agreement. The series A-1 shares automatically converted into common stock upon the completion of our initial public offering (“IPO”).
 On a program-by-program basis, through the completion of a Phase 1b clinical trial for each of IK-175 and IK-412, Bristol Myers Squibb has the exclusive right with respect to such Collaboration Candidate to a worldwide exclusive license with us to develop, commercialize and manufacture the compound (and products and diagnostic products containing such compounds) underlying such Collaboration Candidate. Additionally, if we do not complete a Phase 1b clinical trial by the end of the research term (as defined below), we may elect to provide a data package to Bristol Myers Squibb upon which Bristol Myers Squibb may exercise the foregoing option for an additional $0.25 million fee.
 As previously disclosed in 2021, the IK-412 program experienced manufacturing delays as a key component required in the manufacturing of IK-412 is similarly essential to the manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines and therapies. Considering these delays and the timeline of the Bristol Myers Squibb partnership, we made the strategic decision to pause IK-412 development activities for the remainder of the Bristol Myers Squibb contract term after the completion of on-going CMC activities, which concluded in 2022.
 If and when Bristol Myers Squibb exercises its rights for a Collaboration Candidate, and as a result of the timing of our submission of INDs with respect to each Collaboration Candidate, Bristol Myers Squibb is required to pay us $50.0 million, in the case of an exercise of its option with respect to IK-175, and $40.0 million, in the case of an exercise of its option with respect to IK-412. The option exercise fees are payable within fifteen (15) days after the execution of each license agreement. Upon the execution of each license agreement, we will become eligible to receive up to $265.0 million under such license agreement in regulatory milestones and $185.0 million in commercial milestones as well as a tiered royalties at rates ranging from the high single to low teen percentages based on worldwide annual net sales by Bristol Myers Squibb, subject to specified reductions.
 Bristol Myers Squibb will continue to pay royalties on a Collaboration Candidate-by-Collaboration Candidate and country-by-country basis, until the latest of (i) there being no valid claim under the licensed patents covering the Collaboration Candidate, (ii) expiration of all regulatory exclusivity for the Collaboration Candidate in such country, and (iii) twelve (12) years after the first commercial sale of the Collaboration Candidate in the applicable country (the Royalty Term), after which the applicable license granted to Bristol Myers Squibb in such country will become non-exclusive, fully paid-up, perpetual, irrevocable and royalty-free.
 The research term under the Bristol Myers Squibb Collaboration Agreement continues for a period of five (5) years from its effective date. The term of any license agreement described above would continue on a Collaboration Candidate-by-Collaboration Candidate and country-by-country basis until the expiration of all Royalty Terms under such agreement, unless earlier terminated as described below.
 The Bristol Myers Squibb Collaboration Agreement may be terminated (i) by either party on a program-by-program basis if the other party remains in material breach of the Bristol Myers Squibb Collaboration Agreement following a cure period to remedy the material breach, (ii) by Bristol Myers Squibb at will on a program-by-program basis or in its entirety, (iii) by either party, in its entirety, upon bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party, or (iv) automatically, on a program-by-program basis if Bristol Myers Squibb fails to timely deliver an opt-in notice to us.
 Each license agreement may be terminated (i) by either party if the other party remains in material breach of the license agreement following a cure period to remedy the material breach, (ii) by Bristol Myers Squibb at will, (iii) by either party, in its entirety, upon bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party, or (iv) by us, in its entirety, if Bristol Myers Squibb challenges a patent licensed by us to Bristol Myers Squibb under the license agreement or any jointly-owned collaboration patents.
 Upon our termination of a license agreement for Bristol Myers Squibb’s breach, bankruptcy or insolvency or patent challenge, we would receive (i) upon our timely request, a nonexclusive worldwide license under Bristol Myers Squibb’s know-how and patents covering the applicable licensed compound to the extent that such compound (or product or diagnostic product containing such compound) has been or is in active development or commercialization as of termination; and (ii) subject to determination of an applicable license payment in accordance with the license agreement, an exclusive license for the foregoing. If Bristol Myers Squibb terminates a license agreement for our breach or bankruptcy or insolvency, Bristol Myers Squibb’s license will survive for six (6)
months. Additionally, in the event of our material breach, Bristol Myers Squibb may elect to have the license agreement continue, with all future payments under that license agreement reduced by 50%.
 Patent License Agreement with the University of Texas at Austin
In March 2015, we entered into an exclusive patent license agreement (the “License Agreement”) with the University of Texas at Austin, or the University, pursuant to which the University granted us a worldwide license to certain technology and IP rights relating to IK-412, a kynurenine-degrading enzyme.
 Pursuant to the License Agreement, and we pay a license fee of approximately $40,000 per year. We will also be obligated to make milestone payments to the University of up to an aggregate of $0.7 million upon meeting certain development milestones and up to an aggregate of $4.0 million upon meeting certain regulatory milestones, as well as low single digit royalties based on worldwide annual net sales on any licensed product, subject to specified reductions.
We will be obligated to continue to pay royalties on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, as long as there is an existing valid claim under the licensed patents in such country. Please see “Business—Intellectual Property—IK-412,” for additional information concerning the intellectual property related to the License Agreement.
The term of the License Agreement expires on licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the expiration of all royalty terms, unless earlier terminated as described below.
The License Agreement may be terminated (i) by either party if the other party remains in breach of the license agreement following a cure period to remedy the breach, (ii) by us at will, (iii) by the University, in its entirety, upon our bankruptcy or insolvency, or (iv) by the University, in its entirety, if we challenge a patent licensed by the University to us under the license agreement.
License Agreement with AskAt
In connection of our acquisition of Arrys Therapeutics, Inc. (“Arrys”), in December 2018, we acquired in-process research and development assets related to AskAt Inc.’s, (“AskAt”) selective EP4 antagonists based on the intellectual property associated with a License Agreement, or the AskAt Agreement, between Arrys and AskAt, dated December 14, 2017. Pursuant to the AskAt Agreement, AskAt granted Arrys an exclusive license worldwide, other than China and Taiwan, to the research and development of the licensed compounds in human diseases. AskAt controls the prosecution and maintenance of all intellectual property rights pertaining the licensed technology.
Pursuant to the AskAt Agreement, we are obligated to make milestone payments to AskAt, including up to $4.0 million upon the achievement of certain clinical development milestones, as well as milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $600 million upon the achievement of certain worldwide annual net sales milestones. We are also obligated to pay low single-digit royalties on annual worldwide net sales on a licensed-product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, for the period beginning upon the first commercial sale in such country and ending upon the later of (i) 10 years from the first commercial sale in such country, or (ii) the expiration of valid claims in such country. Please see “Business—Intellectual Property—EP4 Antagonists Patent Families,” for additional information concerning the intellectual property related to the AskAt Agreement.
The term of the AskAt Agreement expires on licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the royalty term for such licensed product, unless earlier terminated as described below.
The License Agreement may be terminated (i) by either party if the other party remains in material breach of the license agreement following a cure period to remedy the breach, (ii) by us for convenience upon 180 days’ notice or (iii) by either party, in its entirety, upon bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party.
Intellectual Property
 We seek to protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology that we consider important to our business, including by pursuing patent applications that cover our product candidates and future products, and methods of using the same, as well as any other relevant inventions and improvements that we believe to be commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position. Our commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain, maintain, enforce and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights for the technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business, and to defend any patents we may own or in-license in the future, prevent others from infringing any patents we may own or in-license in the future, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
Patent Protection
As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our product candidates, future products, and proprietary technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, our pending patent applications, and any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties, may not result in the issuance of patents and any issued patents we may obtain do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology or commercialize our product candidates. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in any patents we may own or in-license in the future. Any issued patents that we may own or in-license in the future may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, or have the scope of their claims narrowed. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby limiting the protection such patent would afford the respective product and any competitive advantage such patent may provide.
The term of individual patents depends upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier expiring patent. The term of a patent claiming a new drug product may also be eligible for a limited patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. The term extension period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of a clinical investigation involving human beings is begun and the submission date of an application, plus the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date. The term extension period cannot be longer than five years, and the term extension period may not extend the patent term beyond 14 years from the date of FDA approval. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and only those claims covering the approved product, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Additionally, the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The United States Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension in consultation with the FDA. In the future, if our product candidates receive approval by the FDA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on any issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical studies for each product and other factors. There can be no assurance that our pending patent applications, and any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties, will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustments to the terms of any patents we may own or in-license in the future. In addition, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. Patent term may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our products for an adequate amount of time.
 As of March 1, 2023, our overall patent portfolio includes over fifty (50) patent families comprising issued patents, pending U.S. and PCT International patent applications, and pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions. The patents and patent applications have claims relating to our current product candidates, methods of use and manufacturing processes, as well as claims directed to potential future products and developments.

Trade Secret Protection
In addition to patents, we rely on unpatented trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets and confidential know-how are difficult to protect. In particular, we anticipate that with respect to the building of our compound library, our trade secrets and know-how will over time be disseminated within the industry through independent development and public presentations describing the methodology. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by executing confidentiality agreements with our collaborators and scientific advisors and non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. We have also executed agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected consultants, scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements we enter into are designed to protect our proprietary information and the agreements or clauses requiring
assignment of inventions to us are designed to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through our relationship with the respective counterparty. We cannot guarantee that we will have executed such agreements with all applicable employees and contractors, or that these agreements will afford us adequate protection of our intellectual property and proprietary information rights. In addition, our trade secrets and/or confidential know-how may become known or be independently developed by a third party or misused by any collaborator to whom we disclose such information. These agreements may also be breached, and we may not have an adequate remedy for any such breach. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information, third parties may independently develop the same or similar proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our proprietary information. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Intellectual Property.”
 Trademark Protection
We have filed for and obtained Notices of Allowance for trademark protection with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the IKENA and IKENA ONCOLOGY word marks for goods and services.
Commercialization
Subject to receiving marketing approvals, we expect to commence commercialization activities by building a focused sales and marketing organization in the United States to sell our products. We believe that such an organization will be able to address the community of oncologists who are the key specialists in treating the patient populations for which our product candidates are being developed. The responsibilities of the marketing organization would include developing educational initiatives with respect to approved products and establishing relationships with researchers and practitioners in relevant fields of medicine. Outside the United States, we expect to enter into distribution and other marketing arrangements with third parties for any of our product candidates that obtain marketing approval.
Manufacturing
We do not have any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates undergoing preclinical testing, as well as for clinical testing and commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval.
All of our drug candidates are small molecules and are manufactured in synthetic processes from available starting materials. The chemistry appears amenable to scale-up and does not currently require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
If necessary, we expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of companion diagnostics for our products, which are assays or tests to identify an appropriate patient population. Depending on the technology solutions we choose, we may rely on multiple third parties to manufacture and sell a single test.
Governmental Regulation
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, recordkeeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of drugs. We, along with our vendors, contract research organizations, or CROs, clinical investigators and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
In the United States, where we are initially focusing our drug development, the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, as amended, and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time with respect to product development, clinical testing, approval or any other regulatory requirements relating to product manufacture, processing, handling, storage, quality control, safety, marketing, advertising, promotion, packaging, labeling, export, import, distribution, or sale, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions or other legal consequences. These sanctions or consequences could include, among other things, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, issuance of clinical holds for ongoing studies, suspension or
withdrawal of approved applications, warning or untitled letters, product withdrawals or recalls, product seizures, relabeling or repackaging, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
Our product candidates must be approved for therapeutic indications by the FDA before they may be marketed in the United States. For drug product candidates regulated under the FD&C Act, FDA must approve a New Drug Application, or NDA. The process generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements; 
 •completion of the manufacture, under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, conditions, of the drug substance and drug product that the sponsor intends to use in human clinical trials along with required analytical and stability testing; 
 •submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually and when certain changes are made; 
 •approval by an institutional review board (“IRB”) or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication; 
 •preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA; 
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the application for review; 
 •satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 •satisfactory completion of FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; 
 •payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA; and 
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA, including, where applicable, consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States. 
 Preclinical studies and clinical trials for drugs
 Before testing any drug in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess safety and in some cases to establish the rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal and state regulation and requirements, including GLP requirements for safety/toxicology studies. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND.
An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before clinical trials may begin. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes the results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and imposes a full or partial clinical hold. FDA must notify the sponsor of the grounds for the hold and any identified deficiencies must be resolved before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may result in the FDA not allowing clinical trials to commence or not allowing clinical trials to commence on the terms originally specified in the IND. A clinical hold can also be imposed once a trial has already begun, thereby halting the trial until the deficiencies articulated by FDA are corrected.
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, who generally are physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the
clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable compared to the anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trials to public registries. Information about clinical trials, including results for clinical trials other than Phase 1 investigations, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on www.ClinicalTrials.gov, a clinical trials database maintained by the National Institutes of Health.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, FDA will nevertheless accept the results of the study in support of an NDA if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
Clinical trials to evaluate therapeutic indications to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap.
•Phase 1—Phase 1 clinical trials involve initial introduction of the investigational product in a limited population of healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, excretion the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. 
 •Phase 2—Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the drug’s potential efficacy, to determine the optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. 
 •Phase 3—Phase 3 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and physician labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA.
 In August 2018, the FDA released a draft guidance entitled “Expansion Cohorts: Use in First-In-Human Clinical Trials to Expedite Development of Oncology Drugs and Biologics,” which outlines how drug developers can utilize an adaptive trial design commonly referred to as a seamless trial design in early stages of oncology drug development (i.e., the first-in-human clinical trial) to compress the traditional three phases of trials into one continuous trial called an expansion cohort trial. Information to support the design of individual expansion cohorts are included in IND applications and assessed by FDA. Expansion cohort trials can potentially bring efficiency to drug development and reduce development costs and time.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials or post-marketing studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of NDA approval.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators fifteen days after the trial sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human volunteers and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must also notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity,
strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. marketing approval for drugs
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA package requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. An NDA is a request for approval to market a new drug for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of the drug’s safety and efficacy for the requested indications. The marketing application is required to include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA must approve an NDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States.
The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs to ensure they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA or BLA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the NDA. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe and effective for the indications sought and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed, including cGMP requirements, designed to assure and preserve the product’s continued identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the goals and polices agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA targets ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular entity NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular entity NDA for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard or priority NDAs and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Further, under PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA also may require submission of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, if it believes that a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. A REMS can include use of risk evaluation and mitigation strategies like medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, special monitoring or other risk-minimization tools.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and other requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a Complete Response Letter. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response Letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response Letter, the FDA may require additional clinical or preclinical testing or recommend other actions, such as requests for additional information or clarification, that the applicant might take in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have
been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition with either a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, though companies developing orphan products are eligible for certain incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing and waiver of application fees.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same therapeutic agent for the same indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a subsequent product’s showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the original applicant cannot produce sufficient quantities of product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different therapeutic agents for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same therapeutic agent for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for the same therapeutic agent for the same indication before we do, unless we are able to demonstrate that our product is clinically superior. If an orphan designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity. Further, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Expedited development and review programs for drugs
 The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval, and the purpose of these programs is to either expedite the development or review of important new drugs to get them to patients more quickly than standard FDA review timelines typically permit.
A new drug is eligible for fast track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Fast track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor interactions with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed. Rolling review means that the FDA may review portions of the marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application.
In addition, a new drug may be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug alone or in combination with one or more other drugs may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient product development program beginning as early as Phase 1, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate.
Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with fast track or breakthrough therapy designation, may also be eligible for additional FDA programs intended to expedite the review and approval process, including priority review designation and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review, once an NDA is submitted, if the product that is the subject of the marketing application has the potential to provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. Under priority review, the FDA’s goal date to take action on the marketing application is six months compared to ten months for a standard review.
Products are eligible for accelerated approval if they are designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and can be shown to have an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
 Accelerated approval is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, adequate and well-controlled additional post-approval confirmatory trials to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. Under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, or FDORA, the FDA is now permitted to require, as appropriate, that such trials be underway prior to approval or within a specific time period after accelerated approval is granted. Additionally, under FDORA, the FDA has increased authority for expedited procedures to withdraw approval of a drug or an indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. In addition, for products being considered for accelerated approval, the FDA generally requires, unless otherwise informed by the Agency, that all advertising and promotional materials intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days of marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period. After the 120-day period has passed, all advertising and promotional materials must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination or publication.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the scientific or medical standards for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval, though they may expedite the development or review process.
Pediatric information and pediatric exclusivity
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, as amended, certain NDAs and certain NDA supplements must contain data that can be used to assess the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The FD&C Act requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a product candidate that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to a drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted, except that PREA will apply to an original NDA for a new active ingredient that is orphan-designated if the drug is a molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer.
A drug can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
U.S. post-approval requirements for drugs
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and
educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe approved products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, including not only by company employees but also by agents of the company or those speaking on the company’s behalf, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including investigation by federal and state authorities. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties, including liabilities under the False Claims Act where products are obtain reimbursement under federal health care programs. Promotional materials for approved drugs must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-market testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. In addition, manufacturers and their subcontractors involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements on sponsors and their CMOs. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third party manufacturers that a sponsor may use. Manufacturers and manufacturers’ facilities are also required to comply with applicable product tracking and tracing requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements may subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. There is also a continuing, annual program user fee for any marketed product.
The FDA may withdraw approval of a product if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 •the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; 
 •fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
 •refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or withdrawal of product approvals; 
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; 
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and 
 •consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; or mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and issuance of corrective information. 
 Regulation of companion diagnostics
Companion diagnostics identify patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular therapeutic product; identify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious side effects as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic product; or monitor response to treatment with a particular therapeutic product for the purpose of adjusting treatment to achieve improved safety or effectiveness. Companion diagnostics are regulated as medical devices by the FDA. In the United States, the FD&C Act, and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption or FDA exercise of enforcement discretion applies, diagnostic tests generally require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercialization. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are clearance of a premarket notification, or 510(k), and approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA.
To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, or for certain modifications to devices that have received 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or to a pre-amendment device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, or a predicate device, for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a PMA. In making a determination that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the FDA compares the proposed device to the predicate device and assesses whether the subject device is comparable to the predicate device with respect to intended use, technology, design and other features which could affect safety and effectiveness. If the FDA determines that the subject device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device, the subject device may be cleared for marketing. The 510(k) premarket notification pathway generally takes from three to twelve months from the date the application is completed, but can take significantly longer.
A PMA must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the quality system regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. The FDA’s review of an initial PMA is required by statute to take between six to ten months, although the process typically takes longer, and may require several years to complete. If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny the approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post-approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
On July 31, 2014, the FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for “In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.” According to the guidance document, for novel therapeutic products that depend on the use of a diagnostic test and where the diagnostic device could be essential for the safe and effective use of the corresponding therapeutic product, the companion diagnostic device should be developed and approved or cleared contemporaneously with the therapeutic, although the FDA recognizes that there may be cases when contemporaneous development may not be possible. However, in cases where a drug cannot be used safely or effectively without the companion diagnostic, the FDA’s guidance indicates it will generally not approve the drug without the approval or clearance of the diagnostic device. The FDA also issued a draft guidance in July 2016 setting forth the principles for co-development of an in vitro companion diagnostic device with a therapeutic product. The draft guidance describes principles to guide the development and contemporaneous marketing authorization for the therapeutic product and its corresponding in vitro companion diagnostic.
Once cleared or approved, the companion diagnostic device must adhere to post-marketing requirements including the requirements of the FDA’s QSR, adverse event reporting, recalls and corrections along with product marketing requirements and limitations. Like drug makers, companion diagnostic makers are subject to unannounced FDA inspections at any time during which the FDA will conduct an audit of the product(s) and the company’s facilities for compliance with its authorities.
Other regulatory matters
Following product approval, where applicable, the manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities around product candidates and/or commercialization are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA. Regulatory agencies with authority over product candidates may include, and are not limited to, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments and governmental agencies.
Other healthcare laws
Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors, both governmental and commercial, will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our business operations and any current or future arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we develop, market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In the United States, these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, those described below.
•The federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”) prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or certain rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the federal AKS or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus treble damages, imprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs. In addition, the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (“FCA”). 
 •The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the FCA, prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false, fictitious or fraudulent; knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false statement or record material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil FCA, the government may impose civil fines and penalties for each false claim, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity, and potentially individuals associated with the entity, from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. 
 •The federal civil monetary penalties laws impose civil fines for, among other things, the offering or transfer or remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary, if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies. 
 •The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme, or attempting to execute a scheme, to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity may be found guilty of violating HIPAA without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. 
 •HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”) and their respective implementing regulations, impose, among other things, specified requirements on covered entities and their respective business associates relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of technical safeguards of such information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates in some cases, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 
 •The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”) imposed new annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians (currently defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations extend to include transfers of value made in the previous year to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives.
 •Federal price reporting laws, which require manufacturers to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs, where such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and/or discounts on approved products.
 •Federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers. 

•Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may be broader in scope than the provisions described above and may apply regardless of payor. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and relevant federal government compliance guidance; require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers; restrict marketing practices or require disclosure of marketing expenditures and pricing information. State and foreign laws may govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances. These myriad data privacy and security laws may differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, which may complicate compliance efforts. 
 
The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies continue to scrutinize interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers and increase investigations, prosecutions, convictions and significant settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other related governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, additional oversight and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to similar actions, penalties and sanctions. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company’s attention from its business.
Insurance Coverage and Reimbursement
In the U.S. and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the U.S. such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. In the U.S., the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”). CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. No uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Factors payors consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is, among other considerations:
•a covered benefit under its health plan;
 •safe, effective and medically necessary;
 •appropriate for the specific patient;
 •cost-effective; and
 •neither experimental nor investigational.
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, which will require additional expenditure above and beyond the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Additionally, companies may also need to provide discounts to purchasers, private health plans or government healthcare programs. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, our operations and financial condition. Additionally, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Current and future healthcare reform legislation
In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare, and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. The ACA includes provisions of importance to our potential product candidates that:

•created an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic products, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs; 
 •expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability; 
 •expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price,” or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices; 
 •addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; 
 •expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program; 
 •established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide point-of-sale-discounts off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and 
 •created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. 
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial, Congressional and executive challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact our business.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Due to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) as well as subsequent legislation, these reductions had been suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, a one percent (1%) payment reduction occurred beginning April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022, and the two percent (2%) payment reduction resumed on July 1, 2022. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three (3) to five (5) years.
Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, including bundled payment models. In addition, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their commercial products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. At a federal level, President Biden signed an Executive Order on July 9, 2021 affirming the administration’s policy to (i) support legislative reforms that would lower the prices of prescription drug and biologics, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation caps, and, by supporting the development and market entry of lower-cost generic drugs and biosimilars; and (ii) support the enactment of a public health insurance option. Among other things, the Executive Order also directs HHS to provide a report on actions to combat excessive pricing of prescription drugs, enhance the domestic drug supply chain, reduce the price that the Federal government pays for drugs, and address price gouging in the industry; and directs the FDA to work with states and Indian Tribes that propose to develop section 804 Importation Programs in accordance with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, and the FDA’s implementing regulations. FDA released such implementing regulations on September 24, 2020, which went into effect on November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. On September 25, 2020, CMS stated drugs imported by states under this rule will not be eligible for federal rebates under Section 1927 of the Social Security Act and manufacturers would not report these drugs for “best price” or Average Manufacturer Price purposes. Since these drugs are not considered covered outpatient drugs, CMS further stated it will not publish a National Average Drug Acquisition Cost for these drugs. If implemented, importation of drugs from Canada may materially and adversely affect the price we receive for any of our product candidates. Further, on November 20, 2020 CMS issued an Interim Final Rule implementing the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates would have been calculated for certain drugs and biologicals based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita. However, on December 29, 2021, CMS rescinded the Most Favored Nations rule. Additionally, on December 2, 2020, HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to court order, the removal and addition of the aforementioned safe harbors were delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2026. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“the IRA”) further delayed implementation of this rule to January 1, 2032. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
 On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug sponsor to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
 Outside the United States, ensuring coverage and adequate payment for a product also involves challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with government authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory approval for a product and may require a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of a product to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in commercialization.
 In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed upon. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union Member States may approve a specific price for a product or may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union Member States, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced Member States, can further
reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries.
Compliance with other federal and state laws or requirements; changing legal requirements
If any products that we may develop are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, labeling, packaging, distribution, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, among other requirements to which we may be subject.
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive recordkeeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements may subject firms to legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, relabeling or repackaging, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any claim or action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on marketing, sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling or packaging; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional recordkeeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
Other U.S. environmental, health and safety laws and regulations
We may be subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.
We maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses that we may incur due to injuries to our employees, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us.
In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.
Government regulation of drugs outside of the United States
To market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, manufacturing, commercial sales and distribution of our products. For instance, in the United Kingdom and the EU, medicinal products must be authorized for marketing by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.

•Centralized procedure—The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid throughout the EU, and in the additional Member States of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) (Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway). Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products (gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and 

tissue engineered products) and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, which includes products for the treatment of cancer. For medicines that do not fall within one of the mandatory categories, an applicant still has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) as long as the medicine concerned contains a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health in the EU. If pursuing a marketing authorization of a product candidate for a therapeutic indication under the centralized procedure, the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) is responsible for conducting an initial assessment of whether a product meets the required quality, safety and efficacy requirements, and whether a product has a positive benefit/risk ratio. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application (“MAA”) by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of an MAA considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, it provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who make the final decision to grant a marketing authorization, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is 150 days, excluding clock stops, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.
•National authorization procedures—There are also two other possible routes to authorize products for therapeutic indications in several countries, which are available for products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure: 
 •Decentralized procedure—Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU Member State for a medicinal product that has not yet been authorized in any EU Member State and that does not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. 
 •Mutual recognition procedure—In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU 
 Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, additional marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU Member States in a procedure whereby the countries concerned recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
In both cases, as with the centralized procedure, the competent authorities of the EU Member States assess the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy before granting the marketing authorization.
 Now that the UK (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) has left the EU, Great Britain is no longer covered by centralized marketing authorizations (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, centralized marketing authorizations continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with a centralized marketing authorization were automatically converted to Great Britain marketing authorizations on January 1, 2021. For a period of three years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”), the UK medicines regulator, may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain marketing authorization. A separate application will, however, still be required. On January 24, 2023, the MHRA announced that a new international recognition framework will be put in place from January 1, 2024. Under this new framework, the MHRA will have regard to decisions on the approval of a marketing authorization made by the EMA and certain other regulators when considering whether to grant a UK marketing authorization. The MHRA also has the power to have regard to marketing authorizations approved in EU Member States through decentralized or mutual recognition procedures with a view to more quickly granting a marketing authorization in the UK or Great Britain.
 In the EU, new products for therapeutic indications that are authorized for marketing (i.e., innovator products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic applicants from referencing the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the innovator product when applying for a generic marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the innovator product was first authorized in the EU. The additional two-year period of market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The overall ten-year period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies. There is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EMA to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Even if a product is considered to be a new chemical entity so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company could nevertheless also market another version of the product if such company obtained
marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete and independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EU are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, in the EU a medicinal product may be designated as an orphan medicinal product if it meets the following criteria: (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) it is unlikely that the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would generate sufficient return in the EU to justify the investment needed for its development; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition, or if such a method exists, the product will be of a significant benefit to those affected by that condition. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. During this ten-year orphan market exclusivity period, no MAA shall be accepted, and no marketing authorization shall be granted for a similar medicinal product. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. The ten-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Market exclusivity may also be revoked in very select cases, such as if (i) it is established that a similar medicinal product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior than the authorized product; (ii) the marketing authorization holder of the authorized product consents to such revocation; or (iii) the marketing authorization holder of the authorized product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. An orphan medicinal product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the EU for pediatric studies. The application for orphan designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the MAA if the orphan designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
Prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the EU, applicants must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved pediatric investigation plan (“PIP”) covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. The respective requirements for all marketing authorization procedures are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the so-called Pediatric Regulation. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The Pediatric Committee of the EMA (“PDCO”) may grant deferrals for some medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine for children until there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults. The PDCO may also grant waivers when development of a medicine for children is not needed or is not appropriate, such as for diseases that only affect the elderly population. Before an MAA can be filed, or an existing marketing authorization can be amended, the EMA determines that companies actually comply with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP. If an applicant obtains a marketing authorization in all EU Member States, or a marketing authorization granted in the centralized procedure by the European Commission, and the study results for the pediatric population are included in the product information, even when negative, the medicine is then eligible for an additional six-month period of qualifying patent protection through extension of the term of the Supplementary Protection Certificate or SPC, provided an application for such extension is made at the same time as filing the SPC application for the product, or at any point up to 2 years before the SPC expires, even where the trial results are negative. In the case of orphan medicinal products, a two year extension of the orphan market exclusivity may be available. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.
 In May 2017, the EU adopted the Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (“IVDR”) which became applicable on 26 May 2022 and repealed Directive 98/79/EC on in vitro diagnostic medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of the IVDR are entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the general safety and performance requirements of the IVDR, and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout the EU (in-vitro diagnostic medical devices cannot be marketed in the EU without a CE Mark). The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a third-party assessment by a “Notified Body”. This third-party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer’s product.
 Similar to the United States, the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls.
 In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014 (Clinical Trials Regulation) was adopted which replaced the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The Clinical Trials Regulation was entered in to application on January 31, 2022 and is directly applicable in all the EU Member States (meaning no national implementing legislation in each Member State is required). The transitory provisions of the new Clinical Trials Regulation provide that, by January 31, 2025, all ongoing clinical trials must have
transitioned to the new EU Clinical Trials Regulation. The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EU. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point, through the Clinical Trials Information System, (”CTIS”); a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts (Part I contains scientific and medicinal product documentation and Part II contains the national and patient-level documentation). Part I is assessed by a coordinated review by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned) of a draft report prepared by a Reference Member State. Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
 The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA, which consists of the EU Member States, plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
Government regulation of data collection outside of the United States
 Internationally, numerous jurisdictions have their own data security and privacy legal frameworks with which we will be required to comply if we conduct clinical trials in those jurisdictions or otherwise conduct business in those jurisdictions. In the event we conduct clinical trials in the EEA or otherwise collect personal data from data subjects in the EEA, we will be subject to additional privacy restrictions. The collection and use of personal health data in the EEA is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR applies to the processing of personal data by any company established in the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA to the extent they process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for data controllers of personal data, including stringent requirements relating to the consent of data subjects, expanded disclosures about how personal data is used, enhanced requirements for securing personal data, requirements to conduct privacy impact assessments for “high risk” processing, limitations on retention of personal data, mandatory data breach notification and “privacy by design” requirements, and creates direct obligations on service providers acting as processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to countries that do not ensure an adequate level of protection, like the United States. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the European Union Member States and Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, which may deviate slightly from the GDPR, may result in fines of up to 4% of a company’s global revenue for the preceding financial year, or €20,000,000, whichever is greater. Moreover, the GDPR grants data subjects the right to claim material and non-material damages resulting from infringement of the GDPR. Given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, maintaining compliance with the GDPR will require significant time, resources and expense, and we may be required to put in place additional controls and processes ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. There continues to be a level of uncertainty as to the exact interpretation of the new requirements on any future trials and we may be unsuccessful in implementing all measures required by data protection authorities or courts in interpretation of the new law.
 In addition, further to the UK’s exit from the EU on January 31, 2020 (“Brexit”), the GDPR ceased to apply in the UK at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. However, as of January 1, 2021, the UK’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law, referred to as the UK GDPR. The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the UK’s data protection regime, which is independent from but largely aligned to the EU’s data protection regime. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher.
Although the UK is regarded as a third country under the EU’s GDPR, the European Commission has now issued a decision recognizing the UK as providing adequate protection under the EU GDPR and, therefore, transfers of personal data originating in the EEA to the UK remain unrestricted. Like the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the UK to countries not regarded by the UK as providing adequate protection. The UK government has confirmed that personal data transfers from the UK to the EEA remain free flowing.
 Significantly, to enable the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA or the UK, adequate safeguards must be implemented in compliance with EEA and UK data protection laws. On June 4, 2021, the European Commission issued new forms of standard contractual clauses for data transfers from controllers or processors in the EU/EEA (or otherwise subject to the GDPR) to controllers or processors established outside the EU/EEA (and not subject to the GDPR). The new standard contractual clauses replace the standard contractual clauses that were adopted previously under the EU Data Protection Directive. The UK is not subject to the European Commission’s new standard contractual clauses but has issued a new version of a UK-specific transfer mechanism (i.e. the UK International Data Transfer Agreement or the UK International Transfer Addendum to accompany the European Commission’s
standard contractual clauses for UK Transfers), to enable transfers from the UK. We will be required to implement these new safeguards when conducting restricted data transfers under the EU and UK GDPR and doing so will require significant effort and cost.
 There may be further divergence between the EEA and the UK. The United Kingdom has announced plans to reform the country’s data protection legal framework in its Data Reform Bill, which will introduce significant changes from the EU GDPR. This may lead to additional compliance costs and could increase our overall risk exposure as we may no longer be able to take a unified approach across the EEA and the UK, and we will need to amend our processes and procedures to align with the new framework.
 Data protection authority activity differs across the EEA and the UK, with certain authorities applying their own agenda which shows there is uncertainty in the manner in which data protection authorities will seek to enforce compliance with GDPR. Enforcement uncertainty and the costs associated with ensuring GDPR compliance are onerous and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
 In addition, many jurisdictions outside of Europe are also considering and/or have enacted comprehensive data protection legislation. Compliance with these and any other applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations is a rigorous and time-intensive process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. In addition, should we utilize third party distributors outside of the United States, compliance with such foreign governmental regulations would generally be the responsibility of such distributors, who may be independent contractors over whom we have limited control. If we fail to comply with any such laws or regulations, we may face significant fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
The UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020, and, the EU and the UK have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement (“TCA”) which was provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations. At present, Great Britain has implemented EU legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the EU regulatory framework will continue to apply in Northern Ireland). The regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore aligns in many ways with current EU regulations, however it is likely that these regimes will diverge significantly in the future now that Great Britain’s regulatory system is independent from the EU and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical legislation.
