OVERVIEW
The Company designs, sources and sells branded kitchenware, tableware and other products used in the home and markets its products under a number of widely-recognized brand names and trademarks, which are either owned or licensed by the Company or through retailers’ private labels and their licensed brands. The Company’s products, which are targeted primarily towards consumers purchasing moderately priced kitchenware, tableware and housewares, are sold through virtually every major level of trade. The Company generally markets several lines within each of its product categories under more than one brand. The Company sells its products directly to retailers (who may resell the Company’s products through their websites) and, to a lesser extent, to distributors. The Company also sells a limited selection of its products directly to consumers through its own websites.
The Company’s product categories include two categories of products used to prepare, serve and consume foods, Kitchenware (kitchen tools and gadgets, cutlery, kitchen scales, thermometers, cutting boards, shears, cookware, pantryware, spice racks and bakeware) and Tableware (dinnerware, stemware, flatware and giftware); and one category, Home Solutions, which comprises other products used in the home (thermal beverageware, bath scales, weather and outdoor household products, food storage, neoprene travel products and home décor).
The Company continually evaluates opportunities to expand the reach of its brands and to invest in other companies, both foreign and domestic, that own or license complementary brands.
The Company has a presence in international markets through subsidiaries and affiliate companies that are based outside of the United States. Lifetime Brands Europe Limited is a wholly-owned subsidiary doing business as Kitchen Craft. Kitchen Craft is a leading supplier of kitchenware and tableware products and accessories in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and in over 80 other countries. In 2020, the Company completed its consolidation efforts of Lifetime Brands Europe Limited to create operational efficiencies.

(“Vasconia”), a housewares company and aluminum manufacturer based in Mexico, and a strategic alliance with a Canadian company to distribute many of the Company’s products in Canada.
