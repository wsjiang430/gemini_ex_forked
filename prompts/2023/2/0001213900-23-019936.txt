Item 1. Business.
Our Company



DocGo, Inc. (“DocGo,”“we,” “us,” “our” and “the Company”) aims to redefine access to healthcare. We strive to deliver high-quality, cost-effective healthcare mobility solutions and unlock the further promise and potential of telehealth treatment through our “last-mile” care capabilities. We do so by leveraging our proprietary technology platform powered by artificial intelligence (“AI”), and our network of healthcare professionals, which has provided service in 29 states and in the United Kingdom. We often provide our services in collaboration with leading healthcare organizations, via long-term relationships that are intended to drive meaningful revenue, help provide efficient and effective capital allocation and create low-risk opportunities for significant growth.



Our mission is to provide high quality, highly accessible healthcare for all, empowering the delivery of medical transportation and mobile healthcare outside the traditional “brick-and-mortar” facilities, with more accessible, affordable, and efficient patient-centered care. Since our founding in 2015, through more than 8 million patient interactions, we have created a care delivery model that helps provide better care outside of the physical walls of the healthcare system. We began by developing a state-of-the-art, intuitive platform designed to drive greater efficiency and improved access to patient care. Our innovative technology can change the way healthcare facilities manage patient transportation and eliminate many of the common obstacles faced when scheduling service, ultimately freeing medical professionals to focus more time and their valuable resources on what they do best — providing patient care. Additionally, in certain markets, our Mobile Health in-person care model facilitates medical treatment directly to patients in the comfort of their homes, workplaces, and other non-traditional locations. Working under the guidance of prescribing physicians, our network (which includes both company employees and personnel from a variety of subcontracted labor agencies and some independent contractors) of more than 5,000 medical clinicians including Emergency Medical Technicians (“EMTs”), paramedics, licensed practical nurses (“LPNs”), registered nurses (“RNs”) Advanced Practice Providers (“APPs”) and support staff, provides a wide range of tests, procedures and interventions that previously required a visit to a traditional healthcare setting.

Our Segments



Mobile Health Solutions



The traditional healthcare model requires patients to interact with many levels of healthcare providers — including receptionists, nurses, lab technicians and physicians — for even the most routine tests, procedures and interventions. We recognized that a number of these services could easily be performed by EMTs, paramedics and LPNs under the guidance of physicians, but in the comfort of a patient’s home or workplace. Our patient-centered approach helps limit the need for individuals to seek routine treatment in more expensive and environmentally exposed, less comfortable settings such as emergency departments and urgent care clinics. In addition to providing greater convenience to patients, our Mobile Health solutions help reduce unnecessary burdens on healthcare systems, by freeing up their finite, in-person resources to address more urgent and critical patient needs. DocGo’s Mobile Health clinical services, which we expanded into the home and workplace in 2020, facilitate medical care via a turnkey suite of integrated, “last-mile” solutions. Through DocGo On-Demand and additional Mobile Health programs including expanded population offerings, we provide holistic health, social and shelter coordination services to underserved communities. Our services and solutions include on-site evaluation, diagnostics, triage, and treatment as detailed in the following table:







As patients seek more efficient, more convenient healthcare options, we believe our virtual care-enabling solutions are poised for significant growth, by delivering in-person patient care previously inaccessible outside of the more traditional healthcare settings. We partner with leading national health systems, insurance carriers, private organizations and employers, state and local governments and managed care organizations, to provide our Mobile Health solutions, including NYC Health + Hospitals, New York City Department of Homeless Services, Dollar General, and Mount Sinai Health System. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, we generated approximately 74.0% of our revenues from the solutions provided by our Mobile Health segment.



The success of our care delivery model is reflected in our NPS, or Net Promoter Score, which is one of the most widely accepted standards of customer experience metrics.  Scores are measured from a range of -100 to +100 with scores over 30 commonly viewed as good and over 50 considered excellent.  Our Q4 mobile health NPS score was 76, which is a testament to our customers’ strong perception regarding the value of DocGo’s services.



Transportation Services



DocGo’s digitally-enabled medical mobility solutions are offered under the Ambulnz brand. We help provide reliable, efficient access to local clinical services, including primary and specialty care, dialysis treatments for chronic care management, and transfers between clinical settings. Every vehicle in our fleet is equipped with our proprietary technology platform, which is integrated with some of the nation’s largest electronic medical record (“EMR”) systems.

This integration is designed to provide seamless transfer of electronic patient information and discharge data to our healthcare provider customers, which helps improve order speed and accuracy, and helps eliminate a myriad of manual processes. Consequently, our healthcare facility customers are better able to order, track and manage transportation requests and patient movement, thereby enhancing utilization of resources and cost. Our ShareLinkTM technology is designed to provide our healthcare partners and patients with real-time vehicle locations and accurate estimated time of arrivals and helps deliver valuable peace of mind. As of December 31, 2022, we had 381 ambulances in service throughout the United States, and more than 300 in the United Kingdom. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, we generated approximately 26.0% of our revenues from this segment.



Human Capital Resources



We strive to hire the best talent across our industry, with a focus on inspiring performance. As of December 31, 2022, we had over 3,200 employees, including healthcare professionals, field management personnel and corporate support staff, as represented in the table below. Healthcare professionals consist of EMTs, paramedics, LPNs, RNs, APPs, clinicians and related support staff; field management personnel includes supervisors and managers; and corporate support staff includes software development, billing, finance, sales, marketing, and executives.

 | Full-time | | Part-time | | Total
-------------------------+-----------+-------+-----------+-------+------
Healthcare Professionals | | 1,570 | | 1,180 | | 2,750
Field Management | | 138 | | 3 | | 141 
Corporate Support | | 356 | | 5 | | 361 
Total | | 2,064 | | 1,188 | | 3,252




None of our employees are represented by a labor union or subject to any collective bargaining agreement. In addition to the employees above, as of December 31, 2022, the Company engaged the services of approximately 2,135 people, primarily in the healthcare professional area, through a variety of subcontracted labor agencies and some independent contractors.



Recruiting



We consider our employees to be our most valuable assets. Our employee experience begins with identifying and attracting people who embody our core values and share our vision to provide high-quality patient care. We are committed to building a company that our employees are proud to be a part of, and fostering an environment in which our employees can grow, evolve and discover their existing and untapped potential. We believe our focused approach to recruiting and developing talent allows us to attract strong candidates to continue growing and scaling our business.
Compensation and Benefits



Ongoing evolution in the healthcare system and an aging population mean EMTs, paramedics and nurses are more critical to medical care than ever before, yet EMTs and paramedics remain the lowest paid professionals in the chain of care. Most companies in the industry pay an hourly wage only, and offer no benefits, often resulting in low employee morale, high turnover, and ultimately a less efficient business. We take pride in our high-quality medical professionals and have created an attractive compensation model that demonstrates their vital importance to our business and motivates them to deliver exceptional care.



We offer a pay package which we believe is innovative within our industry. In addition to base hourly wages, DocGo also offers employees bonuses based on certain performance metrics, medical insurance, paid time off, and an equity incentive plan for our frontline clinicians with broad-based rank and file participation — a program that provides the opportunity to acquire an ownership stake in our company. This is in line with our belief that all of our employees are partners in the business, and we want everyone to “think like an owner,” with the best long-term interests of the Company and its shareholders as a driver of decision making. We believe that this approach makes us a more attractive employer and supports a strong pipeline of top-tier talent across all levels of our company.

Employee Engagement



We routinely monitor employee satisfaction, and work to maintain an environment where employees can contribute and thrive.  DocGo has been recognized for its excellent workplace culture and employee satisfaction. One measure of this are the hundreds of positive reviews our employees have given DocGo on leading recruitment websites. DocGo’s employee rating on Indeed is currently 4.3 out of 5.0, and our employee rating on Glassdoor is 4.8 out of 5.0 - ratings that are significantly higher than our industry averages.
Training



We have also created a number of programs to foster the professional development of our employees and to help attract top-tier talent. To help our staff continue to build clinical skills, we created a Medical Mentorship Program whereby EMTs and paramedics can learn advanced medical techniques including phlebotomy, mobile ultrasound, EKG training, point of care testing, vaccine administration, and wound care. Once certified, our employees can put these newly acquired skills to use while providing our Mobile Health services.



Our staff of ten training coordinators runs a robust, in-person onboarding program to help train employees and keep them up to date in relevant procedures and protocols. We are an official American Heart Association Training Site and offer all of our employees in-house basic life support (BLS), advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS), and pediatric advanced life support (PALS) training and certification.



We have also implemented a virtual training program for company policy and procedures training, mandated OSHA training courses, hazardous materials awareness, FEMA Incident Command Systems training (100, 200, 700, 800), clinical skills, customer service, diversity, HIPAA regulations, safety and compliance, on-site traffic control, and annual documentation training.



Our drivers are additionally trained in emergency vehicle operator course (EVOC) and Coaching the Emergency Vehicle Operator (CEVO) 4 driver training, vehicle maintenance incident reporting, transport risk assessment, critical care transport orientation, and fatigue abatement. Our system is utilized for credential tracking and Continuous Quality Improvement, so that our staff maintains all required credentials relevant to their positions with our company.



Employees and their supervisors are automatically notified at designated times of recertification deadlines. Course completion, assignments, and other compliance requirements are tracked in this system as well. Verification monitoring ensures that all employees meet current state requirements. This tool verifies Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) exclusions at the state and federal levels and performs sanction screening for licensed personnel and 24/7 monitoring of state board licenses.



Our comprehensive training programs utilize a full range of resources, including print materials, training modules, webinars, seminars, and videos provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and federal, state, and local entities, medical institutions, and public health agencies.



In December 2021, we launched DocGo EMS Academy, a full-service program dedicated to recruiting and training EMS clinicians. Combining classroom education with practical hands-on learning, the programs are designed to help existing healthcare professionals advance their careers and provide aspiring entry-level workers with the opportunity to enter the healthcare industry. DocGo EMS Academy is tailored to EMS workers, from EMTs to paramedics. This comprehensive training program is available in select states and offers free tuition for students who continue their employment with DocGo, which we anticipate could assist us in our recruiting efforts.

Merger with Motion Acquisition Corp.



On November 5, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), DocGo Inc., a Delaware corporation (formerly known as Motion Acquisition Corp. “Motion” prior to the Closing Date and after the Closing Date, “DocGo”, ) consummated the previously announced business combination (the “Closing”) pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated March 8, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Motion, Motion Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Motion (“Merger Sub”), and Ambulnz, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Ambulnz”). In connection with the Closing, the registrant changed its name from Motion Acquisition Corp. to DocGo Inc. As contemplated by the Merger Agreement and as described in Motion’s definitive proxy statement/consent solicitation/prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on October 14, 2021 (the “Prospectus”), Merger Sub was merged with and into Ambulnz, with Ambulnz continuing as the surviving corporation (the “Merger” and, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Business Combination”). As a result of the Merger, Ambulnz is a wholly-owned subsidiary of DocGo and each share of Series A preferred stock of Ambulnz, no par value (“Ambulnz Preferred Stock”), Class A common stock of Ambulnz, no par value (“Ambulnz Class A Common Stock”), and Class B common stock of Ambulnz, no par value (“Ambulnz Class B Common Stock”, together with Ambulnz Class A Common Stock, “Ambulnz Common Stock”) was cancelled and converted into the right to receive a portion of merger consideration issuable as common stock of DocGo, par value $0.0001 (“Common Stock”), pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. 


In connection with the Business Combination, the Company raised $158.0 million, net of transaction costs of $20.0 million. This amount was comprised of $43.4 million of cash held in Motion’s trust account from its initial public offering, net of DocGo’s transaction costs and underwriters’ fees of $9.6 million, and $114.6 million of cash in connection with the concurrent PIPE private placement of shares of common stock to certain investors at a price of $10.00 per share (the “PIPE Financing”), net of $10.4 million in transaction costs. These transaction costs consisted of banking, legal, and other professional fees which were recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.



Competition



The U.S. healthcare industry is highly competitive, and we compete with a broad and diverse set of companies spanning both of our business segments. The competitive landscape is highly fragmented for both medical mobility services and “last-mile” healthcare solutions, ranging in each case from small, locally owned and operated providers to large national organizations. While we do not believe that any single competitor offers our full suite of mobility solutions and “last-mile” healthcare services, numerous companies offer components of medical mobility transportation and/or telehealth services that compete with our solutions.



Success in the medical transportation industry is based primarily on the ability to improve customer service, such as on-time performance and efficient call intake; to provide comprehensive clinical care; and to recruit, train and motivate employees, particularly ambulance crews who have direct contact with patients and healthcare personnel. Pricing, billing and reimbursement expertise are also critical. Competitors within the industry vary considerably in type and identity by market, with our primary competitors being small, locally owned operators as well as local fire departments and other local government providers. Larger private provider competitors include Rural/Metro Corporation, Falck, American Medical Response (AMR), Southwest Ambulance, Paramedics Plus and Acadian Ambulance.



Competition in the mobile health industry is primarily based on scale; ease of use, convenience and accessibility; brand recognition; breadth, depth, and efficacy of telehealth services; technology; clinical quality; customer support; cost; reputation; and customer satisfaction and value. The major competitors include much larger, national or regional telehealth providers such as Dispatch Health, Teladoc, Amwell, and One Medical (acquired by Amazon in February 2023) that generally provide telehealth on behalf of self-insured employers and insurance plans. These competitors, however, generally do not provide direct patient care or “last-mile” care on behalf of the provider organization. We also believe there are several smaller, private organizations providing in-home or on-site care utilizing different, higher cost healthcare providers. Non-traditional providers and others such as payors may enter the space and/or develop innovative technologies or business activities that could disrupt the industry. Competition could also increase from large technology companies, such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Verizon, or Microsoft, who may develop their own telehealth solutions or acquire existing industry participants, such as Amazon’s acquisition of One Medical in February 2023, as well as from large retailers like Walmart, CVS and others. Despite the significant growth of telehealth services in recent years, we believe the market is still in its infancy and new competitors with similar and novel models will enter the market as it matures.

Intellectual Property



We own and use trademarks and service marks on or in connection with our services, including both unregistered common law marks and registered trademarks. We have registered “Ambulnz” and our corporate logo in the United States and the United Kingdom. We have registered “DocGo” word mark and design in the both the United States and the United Kingdom and are in the process of registering both in the EU. We are also the registered holder of a variety of domain names that include “Ambulnz”, “DocGo” and similar variations.



Our proprietary platform, mobile application, and associated software code and firmware are protected as trade secrets and our confidential information, as appropriate. We also license the use of certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others. We believe that our intellectual property is a valuable asset to our business that affords us a competitive advantage in the markets in which we operate. We maintain our intellectual property and confidential business information in a number of ways. For instance, we have a policy requiring all companies we work with to execute confidentiality agreements upon commencement of any business relationship with us. Our agreements with customers include confidentiality and non-disclosure provisions, as well.



We require our employees, independent contractors and consultants to execute confidentiality and proprietary agreements in connection with their employment or consulting relationships with us and to assign to us inventions conceived during the term of their employment or engagement while using our property or which relate to our business.



Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we assess and, when necessary, take action to protect our rights as appropriate.




Regulation



Our operations are subject to comprehensive United States federal, state and local rules and regulations and comparable multiple levels of international regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business. The laws and regulations governing our business and interpretations of those laws and regulations continue to expand, are subject to frequent change and may become more restrictive. Our ability to operate profitably will depend in part upon our ability, and that of our healthcare provider partners, to maintain all necessary licenses and to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We therefore devote significant resources to monitoring developments in healthcare regulation. As the applicable laws and regulations change, we may be required to make conforming modifications in our business processes from time to time. In many jurisdictions where we operate, neither our current nor our anticipated business model, in particular with respect to our Mobile Health related services, has been the subject of judicial or administrative interpretation. We cannot be assured that a review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in determinations that could limit or otherwise adversely affect our operations or that the healthcare regulatory environment will not change in a way that restricts our operations.
False Claims Act



The federal False Claims Act is a means of policing false bills or false requests for payment in the healthcare delivery system. Among other things, the federal False Claims Act authorizes the imposition of up to three times the government’s damages and significant per claim civil penalties on any “person” (including an individual, organization or company) who, among other acts:

● | knowingly presents or causes to be presented to the federal government a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay the government, or knowingly conceals;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | knowingly and improperly avoids or decreases an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | conspires to commit the above acts.
--+------------------------------------

In addition, amendments to the federal False Claims Act and Social Security Act impose severe penalties for the knowing and improper retention of overpayments collected from government payors. Under these provisions, within 60 days of identifying and quantifying an overpayment, a provider is required to notify the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), or the Medicare Administrative Contractor of the overpayment and the reason for it and return the overpayment. An overpayment impermissibly retained could subject a party to liability under the federal False Claims Act, exclusion from government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and penalties under the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law discussed below.



The penalties for a violation of the federal False Claims Act range from $5,500 to $11,000 (adjusted for inflation) for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages caused by each false claim, which can be as much as the amounts received directly or indirectly from the government for each such false claim. On June 19, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) issued a final rule announcing adjustments to federal False Claims Act penalties, under which the per claim range increases to a range from $11,803 to $23,607 per claim, so long as the underlying conduct occurred after November 2, 2015.



The federal government has used the statute to prosecute a wide variety of alleged false claims and fraud allegedly perpetrated against Medicare and state healthcare programs, including but not limited to coding errors, billing for services not rendered, the submission of false cost or other reports, billing for services at a higher payment rate than appropriate, billing under a comprehensive code as well as under one or more component codes included in the comprehensive code, billing for care that is not considered medically necessary and false reporting of risk-adjusted diagnostic codes to Medicare Advantage (or Part C) Plans. The Affordable Care Act, as currently structured, provides that claims tainted by a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are false for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. Some courts have held that filing claims or failing to refund amounts collected in violation of the Stark Law can form the basis for liability under the federal False Claims Act. In addition to the provisions of the federal False Claims Act, which provide for civil enforcement through “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits, the federal government can also use several criminal statutes to prosecute persons who are alleged to have submitted false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government.



Federal Fraud and Abuse Laws



The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and their implementing regulations and related rules (collectively, “HIPAA”), established several separate criminal penalties for making false or fraudulent claims to insurance companies and other non-governmental payors of healthcare services. Under HIPAA, these two additional federal crimes are: “Healthcare Fraud” and “False Statements Relating to Healthcare Matters.” The Healthcare Fraud statute prohibits knowingly and recklessly executing a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The False Statements Relating to Healthcare Matters statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact by any trick, scheme or device or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment. This statute could be used by the government to assert criminal liability if a healthcare provider knowingly fails to refund an overpayment. These provisions are intended to punish some of the same conduct in the submission of claims to private payors as the federal False Claims Act covers in connection with governmental health programs.





7







In addition, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law imposes civil administrative sanctions for, among other violations, inappropriate billing of services to federally funded healthcare programs and employing or contracting with individuals or entities who are excluded from participation in federally funded healthcare programs. Moreover, a person who offers or transfers to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration, including waivers of co-payments and deductible amounts (or any part thereof), that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services may be liable for civil monetary penalties of up to $20,000 for each wrongful act. Moreover, in certain cases, providers who routinely waive co-payments and deductibles for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries can also be held liable under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and federal False Claims Act, either of which can impose additional penalties associated with the wrongful act. One of the statutory exceptions to the prohibition is non-routine, unadvertised waivers of co-payments or deductible amounts based on individualized determinations of financial need or exhaustion of reasonable collection efforts. The OIG emphasizes, however, that this exception should only be used occasionally to address special financial needs of a particular patient. Although this prohibition applies only to federal healthcare program beneficiaries, the routine waivers of co-payments and deductibles offered to patients covered by commercial payors may implicate applicable state laws related to, among other things, unlawful schemes to defraud, excessive fees for services, tortious interference with patient contracts and statutory or common law fraud.



State Fraud and Abuse Laws



Various states in which we operate have also adopted similar fraud and abuse laws as the federal laws and statutes described above. The scope of these laws and the interpretations thereof vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. Some state fraud and abuse laws apply to items or services reimbursed by any payor, including patients and commercial insurers, not just those reimbursed by a federally funded healthcare program. A determination of liability under such state fraud and abuse laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions.
Health Information Privacy and Security Laws



There are numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personally identifiable information (“PII”), including health information. In particular, HIPAA establishes privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of protected health information (“PHI”), and require the implementation of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of individually identifiable health information in electronic form. HIPAA’s requirements to “covered entities” and to their independent contractors, agents and other “business associates” that create, receive, maintain or transmit PHI in connection with providing services to covered entities. Although we are a covered entity under HIPAA, we are also a business associate of other covered entities when we are working on behalf of our healthcare provider partners.



Violations of HIPAA may result in civil and criminal penalties. The civil penalties range from $119 to $59,522 per violation, with a cap of $1.8 million per year for violations of the same standard during the same calendar year. However, a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards. We must also comply with HIPAA’s breach notification rule. Under the breach notification rule, covered entities must notify affected individuals without unreasonable delay in the case of a breach of unsecured PHI, which may compromise the privacy, security or integrity of the PHI. In addition, notification must be provided to HHS and the local media in cases where a breach affects more than 500 individuals. Breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals must be reported to HHS on an annual basis. The regulations also require business associates of covered entities to notify the covered entity of breaches by the business associate.



State attorneys general also have the right to prosecute HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action that would allow individuals to sue in civil court for a HIPAA violation, its standards have been used as the basis for the duty of care in state civil suits, such as those for negligence or recklessness in misusing personal information. In addition, HIPAA mandates that HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA-covered entities and their business associates for compliance. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the fine paid by the violator under the Civil Monetary Penalties Law paid by the violator. In light of recent enforcement activity, and statements from HHS, we expect increased federal and state HIPAA privacy and security enforcement efforts.





8







HIPAA also requires HHS to adopt national standards establishing electronic transaction standards that all healthcare providers must use when submitting or receiving certain healthcare transactions electronically.



Many states in which we operate and in which our customers reside also have laws that protect the privacy and security of sensitive and personal information, including health information. These laws may be similar to or even more protective than HIPAA and other federal privacy laws. For example, the laws of the State of California, in which we operate, are more restrictive than HIPAA. Where state laws are more protective than HIPAA, we must comply with the state laws we are subject to, in addition to HIPAA. In certain cases, it may be necessary to modify our systems or planned operations to comply with these more stringent state laws. Not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators, but also some, unlike HIPAA, may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. In addition, state laws are changing rapidly, and there is discussion of a new federal privacy law or federal breach notification law, to which we may be subject.



In recent years, there have been a number of well-publicized data breaches involving the improper use and disclosure of PII and PHI. Many states have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and state officials. In addition, under HIPAA and pursuant to the related contracts that we enter into with our healthcare provider partners and other third parties, we must report breaches of unsecured PHI to our contractual partners following discovery of the breach. Notification must also be made in certain circumstances to affected individuals, federal authorities and others.



In addition to HIPAA, state health information privacy and state health information privacy laws, we may be subject to other state and federal privacy laws, including laws that prohibit unfair privacy and security practices and deceptive statements about privacy and security and laws that place specific requirements on certain types of activities, such as data security and texting.



Anti-Kickback Statute



The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is a broadly worded prohibition on the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce, (i) the referral of a person covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs, (ii) the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs or (iii) the purchasing, leasing or ordering or arranging or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. Certain federal courts have held that the Anti-Kickback Statute can be violated if “one purpose” of a payment is to induce referrals. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation, making it easier for the government to prove that a defendant had the requisite state of mind or “scienter” required for a violation. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs as well as civil and criminal penalties, including fines of $104,330 per violation, plus up to three times the amount of the unlawful remuneration, and imprisonment of up to ten years. Civil penalties for such conduct can further be assessed under the federal False Claims Act. In addition to a few statutory exceptions, the OIG has published safe harbor regulations that outline categories of activities that are deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute provided all applicable criteria are met. The failure of a financial relationship to meet all of the applicable safe harbor criteria does not necessarily mean that the particular arrangement violates the Anti-Kickback Statute. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, such as the OIG.

Federal Stark Law



Section 1877 of the Social Security Act, also known as the physician self-referral law and commonly referred to as the Stark Law, prohibits a physician who has a financial relationship, or who has an immediate family member who has a financial relationship, with entities providing certain designated health services from referring Medicare patients to such entities for the furnishing of designated health services, unless an exception applies. Although uncertainty exists, federal agencies and at least one court have taken the position that the Stark Law also applies to Medicaid. Designated health services are defined to include, among others, clinical laboratory services, physical therapy services, occupational therapy services, radiology services including ultrasound services, durable medical equipment and supplies, parenteral and enteral nutrients, equipment, and supplies, home health services, outpatient prescription drugs, inpatient and outpatient hospital services and outpatient speech-language pathology services. The types of financial arrangements between a physician and an entity providing designated health services that trigger the self-referral prohibitions of the Stark Law are broad and include direct and indirect ownership and investment interests and compensation arrangements. The Stark Law prohibits any entity providing designated health services that has received a prohibited referral from presenting, or causing to be presented, a claim or billing for the services arising out of the prohibited referral. Similarly, the Stark Law prohibits an entity from “furnishing” a designated health service to another entity in which it has a financial relationship when that entity bills for the service. The Stark Law also prohibits self-referrals within an organization by its own physicians, although broad exceptions exist. The prohibition applies regardless of the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral. Unlike the federal Anti-Kickback Statute discussed above, the Stark Law is a strict liability statute, which means proof of specific intent to violate the law is not required.



If the Stark Law is implicated, the financial relationship must fully satisfy a Stark Law exception. If an exception is not satisfied, then the parties to the arrangement could be subject to sanctions, including denial of payment for claims for services provided in violation of the statute, mandatory refunds of amounts collected for such services, civil penalties of up to $25,820 for each violation and twice the dollar value of each such service as well as possible exclusion from future participation in the federally funded healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. A person who engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s prohibitions may be fined up to $172,137 for each applicable arrangement or scheme. Amounts collected on claims related to prohibited referrals must be reported and refunded generally within 60 days after the date on which the overpayment was identified. In addition, the government and some courts have taken the position that claims presented in violation of the various statutes, including the Stark Law, and failure to return overpayments in a timely manner can form the basis for liability under the federal False Claims Act discussed below based on the contention that a provider impliedly certifies compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and other rules when submitting claims for reimbursement.

The laws and regulations relating to our operations vary from state to state and many states prohibit general business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine, controlling physicians’ medical decisions or engaging in some practices such as splitting professional fees with physicians. We contract with healthcare providers, physicians or physician-owned professional associations and professional corporations as part of our business. An important aspect of our strategy is to form contractual relationships with different third-party providers pursuant to which we provide them or their patients with medical transportation and/or telehealth services and they pay us for those services out of the fees they collect from patients and third-party payors. In certain instances, we also share a portion of our revenues with our partners. These contractual relationships are subject to various state laws that prohibit fee splitting or the practice of medicine by lay entities or persons and are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or influencing the physician’s professional judgment. In addition, various state laws also generally prohibit the sharing of professional services income with nonprofessional or business interests. Activities other than those directly related to the delivery of healthcare may be considered an element of the practice of medicine in many states. Under the corporate practice of medicine restrictions of certain states, decisions and activities such as scheduling, contracting, setting rates and the hiring and management of non-clinical personnel may implicate the restrictions on the corporate practice of medicine.



State corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting laws vary from state to state and are not always consistent. In addition, these requirements are subject to broad powers of interpretation and enforcement by state regulators. Regulatory authorities or other parties may assert that, despite these arrangements, we are engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or that our contractual arrangements with affiliated third parties constitute unlawful fee splitting. In this event, failure to comply could lead to adverse judicial or administrative action against us and/or our healthcare provider partners, civil or criminal penalties, receipt of cease-and-desist orders from state regulators, loss of licenses, and the need to make changes to the terms of engagement with our provider partners that interfere with our business.

International Regulation



We expect to continue to expand our operations internationally through both organic growth and acquisitions. Our international operations are subject to different, and sometimes more stringent, legal and regulatory requirements, which vary widely by jurisdiction, including anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), and corresponding foreign laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010; regulation by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) and economic sanctions laws; various privacy, insurance, tax, tariff and trade laws and regulations; corporate governance, privacy, data protection, data mining, data transfer, labor and employment, intellectual property, consumer protection and investment laws and regulations; discriminatory licensing procedures; required localization of records and funds; and limitations on dividends and repatriation of capital.
Other Regulations



Our operations are subject to various state hazardous waste and non-hazardous medical waste disposal laws. These laws do not classify as hazardous most of the waste produced from healthcare services. Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations require employers to provide workers who are occupationally subject to blood or other potentially infectious materials with prescribed protections. These regulatory requirements apply to all healthcare facilities, including primary care centers, and require employers to make a determination as to which employees may be exposed to blood or other potentially infectious materials and to have in effect a written exposure control plan. In addition, employers are required to provide or deploy hepatitis B vaccinations, personal protective equipment and other safety devices, infection control training, post-exposure evaluation and follow-up, waste disposal techniques and procedures and work practice controls. Employers are also required to comply with various record-keeping requirements.



Some of our operations may be subject to compliance with certain provisions of the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and comparable statutes in many states. Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, a third-party collection company is restricted in the methods it uses to contact consumer debtors and elicit payments with respect to placed accounts. Requirements under state collection agency statutes vary, with most requiring compliance similar to that required under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Many of the states in which we operate have comparable state statutes as well.
