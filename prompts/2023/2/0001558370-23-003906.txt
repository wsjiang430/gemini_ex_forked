Overview 
We are a biopharmaceutical company with peptide-based new chemical entities rusfertide and JNJ-2113 (formerly known as PN-235) in different stages of development, all derived from our proprietary discovery technology platform. Our clinical programs fall into two broad categories of diseases; (i) hematology and blood disorders, and (ii) inflammatory and immunomodulatory diseases.

Rusfertide 
​
Our most advanced clinical asset, rusfertide (generic name for PTG-300), is an injectable hepcidin mimetic in development for the potential treatment of erythrocytosis, iron overload and other blood disorders and is wholly owned. Hepcidin is a key hormone in regulating iron equilibrium and is critical to the proper development of red blood cells. Rusfertide mimics the effect of the natural hormone hepcidin, but with greater potency, solubility and stability. Data from our rusfertide Phase 2 clinical trials presented at medical conferences in 2021 and 2022 provided evidence regarding the potential of rusfertide for managing hematocrit, reducing thrombotic risk and improving iron deficiency symptoms. Rusfertide has a unique mechanism of action in the potential treatment of the blood disorder polycythemia vera (“PV”), which may enable it to specifically decrease and maintain hematocrit levels within the range of recommended clinical guidelines without causing the iron deficiency that can occur with frequent phlebotomy. Our rusfertide Phase 2 clinical trials include the following: 
​

● | REVIVE, a Phase 2 proof of concept (“POC”) trial, was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2019. We completed enrollment of patients in the first quarter of 2022 with a target of approximately 50 patients to be enrolled through the end of the randomization portion of the trial, which was completed during the first quarter of 2023, and will continue in open label extension.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | PACIFIC, another Phase 2 trial for rusfertide patients diagnosed with PV and with routinely elevated hematocrit levels (>48%), was initiated during the first quarter of 2021 and completion of the 52-week trial is expected during the second quarter of 2023.

At the June 2022 American Society of Clinical Oncology (“ASCO”) Annual Meeting, we presented updated interim results for REVIVE and PACIFIC demonstrating the effects of dosing interruption and resumption. Rusfertide dosing interruption led to loss of effect, including increased phlebotomy rate and increases in hematocrit and red blood cells. Rusfertide restart restored therapeutic benefits. Following the brief clinical hold described below, over 90% of patients in the REVIVE trial provided reconsent and returned to rusfertide treatment after dosing interruption and reinitiation. At the June 2022 European Hematology Association Congress, we presented interim data as of May 2022 showing that rusfertide treatment interruption reverses hematologic gains and re-initiation of treatment restores therapeutic benefits in patients with PV. At the December 2022 American Society of Hematology (“ASH”) meeting, we presented data as of October 2022 related to rusfertide, including a subgroup of analyses of the adverse event profile from the REVIVE trial. These preliminary results indicated that 84% of treatment-emergent adverse events (“TEAEs”) were Grade 2 or below. 16% of patients experienced Grade 3 TEAEs and there were no Grade 4 TEAEs.
​
On March 15, 2023, we announced positive topline results from the blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal portion of the REVIVE trial. Subjects receiving rusfertide achieved statistically significant improvements versus placebo in the trial’s primary endpoint.
​
The double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week randomized withdrawal portion was included as Part 2 of the REVIVE trial study to evaluate rusfertide in PV patients with frequent phlebotomy requirements. In the REVIVE trial, subjects were initially enrolled in the 28-week open label dose-titration and efficacy evaluation Part 1 of the study, followed by 1:1 randomization of 53 subjects to placebo versus rusfertide therapy for a subsequent duration of 12 weeks. More subjects receiving rusfertide during the blinded randomized withdrawal portion of the REVIVE trial were responders compared with placebo (69.2% versus 18.5%, p=0.0003). A study subject was defined as a responder if the subject completed 12 weeks of double-blind treatment while maintaining hematocrit control without phlebotomy eligibility and without phlebotomy. During the 12 weeks of the blinded randomized withdrawal, only 2 of 26 subjects on rusfertide were phlebotomized.
​
VERIFY, a global Phase 3 clinical trial of rusfertide in PV for approximately 250 patients, was initiated in the first quarter of 2022. Significant efforts have been taken toward the goal of full enrollment and a high degree of interest has been observed from physicians and patient communities. We expect enrollment completion in the fourth quarter of 2023.
​
On September 16, 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) placed a clinical hold on our then ongoing rusfertide clinical trials following our submission to the FDA of findings in a 26-week rasH2 transgenic mouse carcinogenicity study. In October 2021, we submitted a Complete Response to the FDA related to the clinical hold, and the FDA removed the clinical hold on October 8, 2021. In our Complete Response, we provided the individual patient clinical safety reports the FDA requested for human cancers observed in rusfertide clinical trials, updated the investigator brochure and patient informed consent forms for ongoing rusfertide trials, proposed new safety and stopping rules in trial protocols for our ongoing rusfertide clinical trials, and performed a comprehensive review of our rusfertide safety database. Dosing of patients and enrollment in ongoing clinical trials with rusfertide resumed in the fourth quarter of 2021.
​
The FDA granted orphan drug designation for rusfertide for the treatment of PV in June 2020, and Fast Track designation for rusfertide for the treatment of PV in December 2020. The EMA granted orphan drug designation for rusfertide for treatment of PV in October 2020. The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for rusfertide for the treatment of PV in June 2021. In April 2022, we received a letter from the FDA indicating the FDA’s intent to rescind Breakthrough Therapy Designation for rusfertide in PV. In June 2022, we voluntarily withdrew our Breakthrough Therapy Designation following correspondence with FDA and based on our internal analysis of the relative utility of Breakthrough Therapy Designation for Phase 3 trials and beyond. The FDA correspondence relating to the Breakthrough Therapy designation does not address the rusfertide Fast Track Designation, which remains active. 
​
In keeping with our organizational prioritization of rusfertide in PV, plans to initiate trials of rusfertide in additional disease indications have been paused. This decision was influenced in part by the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) in the United States and includes previously planned trials of rusfertide in the subset of hereditary hemochromatosis patients with chronic arthropathy.

JNJ-2113 (formerly known as PN-235)
​
Our partnered Interleukin-23 receptor (“IL-23R”) antagonist compound JNJ-2113 is an orally delivered investigational drug that is designed to block biological pathways currently targeted by marketed injectable antibody drugs. Our orally stable peptide approach may offer a targeted therapeutic approach for gastrointestinal (“GI”) and systemic compartments as needed. We believe that, compared to antibody drugs, JNJ-2113 has the potential to provide clinical improvement in an oral medication with increased convenience and compliance and the opportunity for the earlier introduction of targeted oral therapy. 
​
In May 2017, we entered into a worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc. (“Janssen”), a Johnson & Johnson company, to co-develop and co-detail our IL-23R antagonist compounds, including PTG-200 (JNJ-67864238) and certain related compounds for all indications, including inflammatory bowel disease (“IBD”). PTG-200 was a first-generation investigational, orally delivered, IL-23R antagonist for the treatment of IBD. The agreement with Janssen was amended in May 2019 to expand the collaboration by supporting efforts towards second-generation IL-23R antagonists; and in July 2021 to, among other things, enable Janssen to independently research and develop collaboration compounds for multiple indications in the IL-23 pathway and further align our financial interests. 
​
During the fourth quarter of 2021, following a pre-specified interim analysis criteria, a portfolio decision was made by Janssen to advance second-generation product candidate JNJ-2113 (JNJ-77242113) based on its superior potency and overall pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile. A JNJ-2113 Phase 1 trial was completed in the fourth quarter of 2021. 
​
In February 2022, Janssen initiated FRONTIER1, a 255-patient Phase 2b clinical trial of JNJ-2113 in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, which was completed in December 2022. FRONTIER1 was a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated three once-daily dosages and two twice-daily dosages of JNJ-2113 taken orally. The primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients achieving PASI-75 (a 75% improvement in skin lesions as measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) at 16 weeks. In March 2023, we announced positive topline results from the trial. JNJ-2113 achieved the study's primary efficacy endpoint, with a statistically significant greater proportion of patients who received JNJ-2113 achieving PASI-75 responses compared to placebo at Week 16 in all five of the study’s treatment groups. A clear dose response was observed across an eight-fold dose range. Treatment was well tolerated, with no meaningful difference in frequency of adverse events across treatment groups versus placebo. It is our expectation that JNJ-2113 will progress into a Phase 3 registrational study in plaque psoriasis on the strength of the FRONTIER1 data. Advancement of JNJ-2113 into a Phase 3 study and meeting the primary endpoint in that study would qualify us for milestone payments of $50 million and $115 million, respectively. Data will be presented from various pre-clinical and clinical studies on JNJ-2113 at medical conferences beginning in the second quarter of 2023.
​
Other Phase 2 studies of JNJ-2113 that Janssen has initiated include the SUMMIT study of JNJ-2113 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2023 and FRONTIER2, a long-term extension study. A Phase 1 trial of an immediate release formulation of JNJ-2113 in healthy Japanese and Chinese adult participants is currently recruiting. Following the completion of Phase 2 studies of JNJ-2113 in plaque psoriasis, we expect Janssen to initiate a separate Phase 2 trial of JNJ-2113 in a second indication. Additional indications may include any or all of psoriatic arthritis, UC and CD.
​
During the fourth quarter of 2021, we received a $7.5 million milestone payment from Janssen triggered by the completion of data collection for JNJ-2113 Phase 1 activities. In the second quarter of 2022, we received a $25.0 million milestone payment in connection with the dosing of a third patient in FRONTIER1 during the first quarter of 2022. We will be eligible to receive a $10.0 million milestone payment in connection with the dosing of a third patient in the second Phase 2 trial of a second-generation candidate, a $50 million milestone payment upon dosing of a third patient in a Phase 3 trial for a second-generation compound for any indication, and a $115.0 million milestone payment upon a Phase 3 clinical trial for a second-generation compound for any indication meeting its primary clinical endpoint. We

​



remain eligible for up to approximately $855.0 million in future development and sales milestone payments, in addition to the $112.5 million in nonrefundable payments from Janssen received to date. We also remain eligible to receive tiered royalties on net product sales at percentages ranging from mid-single digits to ten percent.
PN-943
​
PN-943 is a wholly owned, investigational, orally delivered, gut-restricted alpha 4 beta 7 (“α4β7”) specific integrin antagonist for IBD. During the second quarter of 2020, we initiated IDEAL, a 159 patient Phase 2 trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of PN-943 in patients with moderate to severe UC. Enrollment in IDEAL was completed during the first quarter of 2022. The trial includes a 12-week induction period, which has been completed, and a 40-week extended treatment period. With the exception of completing the 40-week extended treatment period for eligible patients in the IDEAL trial, which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2023, we do not intend to dedicate further internal resources to clinical development or contract manufacturing activities for our PN-943 clinical program. 
​
Discovery Platform
​
Our clinical assets are all derived from our proprietary discovery platform. Our platform enables us to engineer novel, structurally constrained peptides that are designed to retain key advantages of both orally delivered small molecules and injectable antibody drugs in an effort to overcome many of their limitations as therapeutic agents. Importantly, constrained peptides can be designed to potentially alleviate the fundamental instability inherent in traditional peptides to allow different delivery forms, such as oral, subcutaneous, intravenous, and rectal. We continue to use our peptide technology platform to discover product candidates against targets in disease areas with significant unmet medical needs. For example, we have a pre-clinical stage program to identify an orally active hepcidin mimetic, which we believe will be complementary to the injectable rusfertide for offering the best treatment options for PV, hereditary hemochromatosis and other potential erythropoietic and iron imbalance disorders.
RUSFERTIDE: AN INJECTABLE HEPCIDIN MIMETIC 
Rusfertide, an injectable hepcidin mimetic, was discovered through our peptide technology platform. Hepcidin is a natural hormone that regulates iron metabolism. We are developing rusfertide for the treatment of certain disorders characterized by excessive red blood cells (“RBCs”), iron overload or imbalance. In healthy individuals, hepcidin regulates iron levels by limiting release of iron from macrophages and inhibiting iron absorption from the GI tract. In diseases of excessive RBCs, such as PV, the body consumes iron in the production of cells, leading to iron deficiency, which can be exacerbated by phlebotomy. In diseases of iron overload, such as hereditary hemochromatosis, there may be insufficient hepcidin to maintain appropriate iron levels. In other disorders, iron imbalance can benefit from increased levels of hepcidin-like activity to restore proper balance. Native hepcidin is not a practical therapeutic approach because of stability issues, complexity of synthesis and solubility limitations. We developed rusfertide as a more potent, stable, and soluble injectable hepcidin mimetic.
Mechanism of Action and Rationale
The molecular target of the hormone hepcidin is the cellular trans-membrane protein ferroportin, which functions as the major export channel for intracellular iron in splenic macrophages, liver Kupffer cells, hepatocytes, and duodenal enterocytes. Hepcidin binds to the extracellular domain of ferroportin to block the export of iron from inside these cells to the systemic circulation. As a hepcidin mimetic, rusfertide also downregulates ferroportin to control the supply of iron to the bone marrow, thereby normalizing RBC production. In addition, by limiting excessive absorption of dietary iron by enterocytes and rapid sequestration of iron into the macrophages, vital organs can be protected from the accumulation of toxic iron.

Polycythemia Vera (“PV”)
PV Overview and Market Opportunity
PV is a rare myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized primarily by the overproduction of RBCs. PV is typically caused by a form of Janus Kinase (“JAK”) 2 mutation. PV is a serious chronic condition as the increased RBC count causes the blood to thicken from increased number of smaller rigid RBCs, putting patients at higher risk of cardiovascular and thrombotic events such as heart attack and stroke. According to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (“NCCN”) guidelines, age and thrombosis history determine a patient’s risk classification as either low-risk or high-risk. Regardless of risk categorization, treatment guidelines for PV are consistent: to control the patient’s hematocrit (RBCs as a percentage of whole blood) below 45% in order to reduce the risk of cardiovascular or thrombotic events. PV may progress to myelofibrosis or leukemia.
​
Currently earlier stage patients are typically treated with low dose aspirin and therapeutic phlebotomy alone or hydroxyurea alone or in combination with phlebotomy. At later stages, patients may receive interferons, marketed as Besrami® or Pegasus®, or JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib, marketed as Jakafi®. Cytoreductive therapies such as hydroxyurea, interferons and ruxolitinib can have challenging side effect profiles as they reduce all cell types, not just RBCs. Current treatments are effective in some patients but have distinct limitations, such as cytopenia and cancer. We believe there are substantial PV patient groups that could benefit from a new non-cytoreductive therapeutic option which focuses on RBCs. NCCN guidelines state that hematocrit levels should be maintained below 45% to reduce risk of cardiovascular and thrombotic events. However, analysis of a large medical claims database indicated that 78% of patients were uncontrolled, with hematocrit test results above 45%. This analysis reveals that current therapies do not offer adequate hematocrit control, indicating a significant unmet need in the United States alone where patients may have an elevated risk of cardiovascular and thrombotic events.
There are approximately 100,000 diagnosed and treated patients living in the United States, with a similar number in Europe, representing an estimated market opportunity of approximately $1.0 billion to $2.0 billion. Patients are typically diagnosed between the ages of 50 and 70 and median survival is approximately 20 years. Analysis of a large medical claims database indicates that the predominant treatment for PV is phlebotomy. Cytoreductive agents, such as hydroxyurea, are also commonly used to control blood count in PV patients. Approximately 60% of PV patients are considered to have moderate treatment burden with treatments including frequent phlebotomy and hydroxyurea. We believe rusfertide can potentially benefit a broad spectrum of patients both as a monotherapy or in combination across the continuum of care.
We believe that rusfertide has the potential to provide substantial benefit to patients by offering a treatment focused on managing hematocrit in a consistent and predictable manner, dramatically decreasing the need for phlebotomy. Rusfertide is a non-cytoreductive mimetic of the natural hormone hepcidin, the master regulator of iron homeostasis in the body. Since high RBC production consumes iron stores, PV can cause iron deficiency, which is often exacerbated by phlebotomy. Rusfertide has a unique iron regulatory mechanism, which data from our Phase 2 REVIVE study suggests allows for persistent control of hematocrit without causing iron deficiency. Rusfertide acts by redistributing iron away from the bone marrow, where iron is essential for RBC production, thereby limiting excess RBC production while still providing sufficient iron levels to support other normal cellular and organ functions.
Clinical Development of Rusfertide in PV
​
In the fourth quarter of 2019, we initiated REVIVE, a Phase 2 study of rusfertide in PV designed to evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy in patients requiring phlebotomy (Figure 2). The REVIVE study was expected to enroll approximately 60 patients and consisted of a 16-week open-label dose finding stage every 4 weeks from 10 mg to 80 mg and a 12-week maintenance period at doses which generate desired hematocrit levels, followed by a 12-week randomized and blinded withdrawal stage. The study has an open-label extension for up to three years to monitor long term safety and benefits of the drug. The endpoints of this clinical POC study include measurement of blood parameters (hematocrit and hemoglobin levels), reductions or delay in phlebotomy requirements, and improvements in quality-of-life symptoms.

Figure 2. REVIVE: Rusfertide Phase 2 PV Study Design
During the first quarter of 2021, we initiated PACIFIC, a Phase 2 study for rusfertide in up to 20 patients diagnosed with PV and with routinely elevated hematocrit levels (>48%). Rusfertide dosed twice a week was able to reduce patient mean hematocrit from 53% to below 45% in less than 8 weeks for most patients and within 4-6 weeks for a few patients. Once the patient’s hematocrit was below 45%, dosing was adjusted and weekly dosing was maintained to control hematocrit without phlebotomy. 
​
We currently have the following designations for rusfertide in PV:
​

● | The FDA granted orphan drug designation for rusfertide for the treatment of PV in June 2020;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The EMA granted orphan drug designation for rusfertide for the treatment of PV in October 2020; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The FDA granted Fast Track designation for rusfertide for the treatment of PV in December 2020.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
In consultation with the FDA, we implemented new safety monitoring procedures, including cancer surveillance measures (augmented dermatological examinations) and new stopping rules following a prior 21-day clinical hold on the rusfertide clinical development program. Following the brief clinical hold, over 92% of patients in the REVIVE trial provided reconsent and returned to rusfertide treatment after dosing interruption and re-initiation.
​
We enrolled 63 patients in the ongoing REVIVE Phase 2 clinical trial of rusfertide in PV prior to the clinical hold and we enrolled seven additional patients to target approximately 50 patients to complete the randomized withdrawal part of the study. The vast majority of patients treated with rusfertide were able to eliminate therapeutic phlebotomies and maintain a target hematocrit level of less than 45 percent. Treatment with rusfertide was also shown to reverse iron deficiency, an important side effect of regular therapeutic phlebotomies as a treatment for PV. Early observations suggest a decreased symptom burden over time, including overall burden (myeloproliferative neoplasm total symptom score), as well as measurements specific to mental function, fatigue and itching.
​
Preliminary results indicated that rusfertide therapy resulted in rapid, sustained and durable hematocrit control without clinically meaningful changes in white blood cell and platelet counts. Subjects have been under treatment for a median of 1.5 years with the majority of subjects remaining essentially phlebotomy-free. Rusfertide demonstrated similar efficacy in all categories of patients, independent of the PV patient risk category or concurrent therapy with hydroxyurea, interferon or ruxolitinib. Study participation was halted in one patient due to asymptomatic thrombocytosis. One patient developed acute myelogenous leukemia (“AML”), which was deemed not to be related to

​



rusfertide. Significant adverse events included syncope, peripheral artery aneurysm, gastroenteritis, chest pain, AML, squamous cell carcinoma (skin), melanoma & basal cell carcinoma. Injection site reaction (“ISRs”) were most common and associated with 28.1% of injections and are transient in nature.
​
At the June 2022 ASCO Annual Meeting, we presented updated interim results for REVIVE and PACIFIC demonstrating the effects of dosing interruption and resumption. Rusfertide dosing interruption led to loss of effect, including increased phlebotomy rate and increases in hematocrit and red blood cells. Rusfertide restart restored therapeutic benefits. Following the brief clinical hold described above, over 90% of patients in the REVIVE trial provided reconsent and returned to rusfertide treatment after dosing interruption and reinitiation. At the June 2022 European Hematology Association Congress, we presented interim data as of May 2022 showing that rusfertide treatment interruption reverses hematologic gains and re-initiation of treatment restores therapeutic benefits in patients with PV. At the December 2022 ASH meeting, we presented data as of October 2022 related to rusfertide, including a subgroup of analyses of the adverse event profile from the REVIVE trial. These preliminary results indicated that 84% of treatment-emergent adverse events (“TEAEs”) were Grade 2 or below. 16% of patients experienced Grade 3 TEAEs and there were no Grade 4 TEAEs.
​
On March 15, 2023, we announced positive topline results from the blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal portion of the REVIVE trial. Subjects receiving rusfertide achieved statistically significant improvements versus placebo in the trial’s primary endpoint.
The double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week randomized withdrawal portion was included as Part 2 of the REVIVE trial study to evaluate rusfertide in PV patients with frequent phlebotomy requirements. In the REVIVE trial, subjects were initially enrolled in the 28-week open label dose-titration and efficacy evaluation Part 1 of the study, followed by 1:1 randomization of 53 subjects to placebo versus rusfertide therapy for a subsequent duration of 12 weeks. More subjects receiving rusfertide during the blinded randomized withdrawal portion of the REVIVE trial were responders compared with placebo (69.2% versus 18.5%, p=0.0003). A study subject was defined as a responder if the subject completed 12 weeks of double-blind treatment while maintaining hematocrit control without phlebotomy eligibility and without phlebotomy. During the 12 weeks of the blinded randomized withdrawal, only 2 of 26 subjects on rusfertide were phlebotomized. 
In addition, in subjects with moderate or severe Myeloproliferative Neoplasm-Symptom Assessment Form (MPN-SAF) symptom scores at baseline, the change from baseline was statistically significant in fatigue, problems with concentration, inactivity and itching during the 28-week open label Part 1 of the trial. Meaningful comparison of symptoms assessments in Part 2 are not possible since a majority of subjects randomized to placebo discontinued prior to the 12-week assessment of MPN-SAF symptoms.
Rusfertide continued to be generally well tolerated in the REVIVE trial, with localized injection site reactions comprising the majority of reported adverse events. No new safety signals were observed in safety data disclosed in connection with the Part 2 efficacy results, relative to the safety data from the REVIVE trial presented at the December 2022 ASH Annual Meeting.
​
Based on end of Phase 2 feedback provided by the FDA’s Division of Nonmalignant Hematology and written comments from the EMA, we activated sites and initiated patient screening for VERIFY, a global Phase 3 clinical trial of rusfertide in PV for approximately 250 patients, in the first quarter of 2022 (Figure 3). Significant efforts have been taken toward the goal of full enrollment and a high degree of interest has been observed from physicians and patient communities. We expect enrollment completion in the fourth quarter of of 2023.

OVERVIEW OF DISEASES DRIVEN BY THE IL-23 PATHWAY: PSORIASIS AND INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE 
​
IL-23 is a member of the IL-12 family of cytokines with pro-inflammatory and immune stimulatory properties. Cytokines are cell signaling proteins that are released by cells and affect the behavior of other cells. Binding of the IL-23 ligand to the IL-23R receptor leads to an expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in the local tissue autocrine cascade that is an important pathway of many inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis and IBD. The injectable antibody drug Stelara® (marketed for psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, UC and CD) is a p40 antagonist antibody that inhibits both the IL-23 and IL-12 pathways. Next-generation antibody drugs, such as Tremfya® and Skyrizi®, target the p19 subunit of the IL-23 ligand and are specific inhibitors of the IL-23 pathway, which is believed to be the critical driver of local tissue pathology. Tremfya® and Skyrizi® are approved in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (“PsA”) and are in Phase 3 clinical trials in UC and CD. Eli Lilly and Company’s anti-IL-23 antibody mirikizumab has reported positive results from a Phase 3 program in UC.
Psoriasis
Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the skin that affects 130 million people worldwide and 8 million in the United States, translating to 2-3% of the adult population. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbid conditions including cardiovascular disease, obesity, and 30% of psoriasis patients develop arthritic complications. Psoriasis is also associated with significantly decreased quality of life for patients. 
​
Plaque psoriasis is the most common form of psoriasis, which is recognized as the most prevalent immune-mediated inflammatory disease, involving skin and joints and associated with abnormalities of other systems. Several factors, such as surface area covered and symptom burden, impact whether one’s psoriasis is considered mild, moderate, or severe. Typically, 3-10% of affected body surface area is considered moderate psoriasis, and more than 10% is considered severe psoriasis. Global market sales for psoriasis therapies in 2020 was $13.2 billion, with U.S. market sales of $10.8 billion. The global market forecast for 2030 anticipates $25.3 billion, with U.S. market sales of $20.9 billion. Identification of the IL-23/IL-17 axis as the key pathway driving psoriatic inflammation has led to the development of more effective and safer systemic therapies that inhibit IL-17 (e.g., Taltz®, Cosentyx®) and IL-23 (e.g., Tremfya®, 

10
​



Skyrizi®). These biologics have revolutionized the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis, with superior efficacy and safety compared to conventional oral therapies (e.g., methotrexate, cyclosporin), and first-generation biologics (e.g., anti-TNFs, Stelara®). The anti-IL-17 and anti-IL-23 classes are associated with Psoriasis Area Skin Index (“PASI”) 75 scores (75% improvement in skin inflammation) in 90% of patients, and complete clearance of the skin (PASI 100) in 30-40% of patients. The anti-IL-17 class is ineffective in IBD, surprisingly showing overall worsening of disease in Phase 2 studies and is reflected in the product labels. There is still unmet need for new therapies. Only 25% of biologic eligible moderate to severe psoriasis patients are treated with a biologic. The parenteral route of administration for these advanced biologics poses a patient level barrier to entry. Two oral medicines have been approved in moderate to severe psoriasis. Otezla® was approved in 2014. It is the least effective of all drugs approved since 2004 with PASI 75 of approximately 30% but is used widely because of a perceived positive safety profile. In 2022, the first TYK2 inhibitor, Sotyktu®, was approved. In Phase 3 studies, it has demonstrated approximately 55% PASI 75 scores. There is still significant need for safe and effective oral therapies in moderate to severe psoriasis. 
Psoriatic Arthritis (“PsA”)
PsA is an inflammatory disease of the peripheral and axial joints that complicates psoriasis in up to 30% of patients. Among the 8 million patients in the United States with psoriasis in 2022, it is estimated that approximately 1 million patients have PsA. Many patients with active PsA may have mild psoriasis and many patients with severe psoriasis may have only mild PsA symptoms. PsA is associated with several chronic conditions. PsA may present even before skin symptoms in 10% to 15% of patients. Cardiovascular comorbidities have a higher prevalence in PsA than psoriasis and can impact lifespan and quality of life. Several new targeted therapies have been approved for use in PsA, with additional therapies in development. These advances have improved outcomes, including reductions in musculoskeletal symptoms, skin manifestations and radiographic joint damage. The same drugs approved in psoriasis are also approved in PsA. One notable exception is that the JAK inhibitors, Xeljanz® and Rinvoq®, are approved in PsA without the respective label in psoriasis.
​
Inflammatory Bowel Disease (“IBD”)
​
IBD is a group of chronic autoimmune and inflammatory conditions of the colon and small intestine, consisting primarily of UC and CD. In UC, inflammation may be limited to part of the colon or extend through its entirety. UC is primarily characterized by ulceration of the intestinal surface, accompanied by rectal bleeding and frequent, urgent bowel movements. CD occurs anywhere along the GI tract, commonly affecting the small intestine and the proximal large intestine. CD complications may include strictures and fistula, which penetrate all layers of the intestine. UC is usually diagnosed earlier than CD due to bleeding symptoms. Patients with CD may initially present with abdominal pain, fatigue and anorexia, which can be misdiagnosed. Both diseases’ peak diagnosis years are in young adulthood and are found about equally in both males and females. Management is lifelong and affects school attendance, graduation rates, childbearing and work productivity. IBD prevalence is increasing worldwide and is correlated with the adoption of western diets and lifestyle, as well as genetic factors (5 to 20% of affected patients have a first degree relative with the disease). 
​
According to the Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America, there are more than 1.6 million IBD patients in the United States alone, an increase of approximately 200,000 patients since 2011. As many as 70,000 new cases of IBD are diagnosed in the United States each year, and there may be as many as 80,000 children in the United States with IBD. In 2020, GlobalData estimated that the UC market was approximately $6.8 billion across eight major markets: United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom and Japan. This is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 6.0% to $12.3 billion by 2029. In 2020, GlobalData estimated that the CD market reached approximately $7.4 billion across those same eight major markets and is expected to grow approximately 5.5% per year to $12.6 billion by 2029.
For many years, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (“TNF-α”) antibody drugs were the primary treatment for moderate-to-severe IBD. Humira® and Remicade® are injectable and infused, respectively. Approximately one third of IBD patients do not respond to TNF-α antibody drugs and approximately another 30% to 40% become refractory within the first year of treatment. Additionally, TNF-α antibody drugs may predispose patients to an increased risk of serious

infection and the development of anti-drug antibodies, which over time can cause loss of drug response. More recently, antibody products focused on potentially safer mechanisms of action have been gaining market share. One such product is Takeda Pharmaceuticals’ Entyvio®, which targets the α4β7 integrin pathway. Takada Pharmaceuticals reported 2021 sales of Entyvio® of approximately $5.0 billion. Similarly, Johnson & Johnson’s Stelara®, which targets the Interleukin 12 (“IL-12”) and Interleukin 23 (“IL-23”) pathways, has gained significant traction. Johnson & Johnson global sales of Stelara® (approved for psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, moderate-to-severe CD and UC) exceeded $9.2 billion in 2021. Three anti-IL-23 mAbs are in Phase 3 studies or beyond in IBD: Tremfya®, Skyrizi® and Ely Lilly and Company’s mirikizumab. The development of oral medicine has been an unmet need and priority in IBD. The pan-JAK inhibitor Xeljanz® was approved in UC but not CD in 2018. The label contains black box warnings for “an increased risk of serious heart-related events such as heart attack or stroke, cancer, blood clots, and death”. The more selective JAK1/3 inhibitor Rinvoq® was approved in 2022 for UC and CD. The label carries the same black box warnings. The S1P1 modulator class of oral small molecules has also demonstrated efficacy in IBD, with Zeposia® approved in UC (but not CD) in 2021, and etrasimod completing a successful Phase 3 program in UC. The S1P1 class is associated with immunosuppression, cardiac, pulmonary and ocular toxicities.
The development of new, potent and targeted orally delivered therapies for IBD may offer safer and more effective treatment options, alone or in combination, for moderate-to-severe IBD patients. In addition, many clinicians continue to advocate for earlier introduction of targeted therapeutics in mild-to-moderate IBD to prevent disease progression and irreversible gastrointestinal damage. Given that the most effective agents in IBD induce remission in no more than 30% of patients, there has been much recent interest in combination therapies to break through this “therapeutic ceiling”. In 2022, Janssen reported results of the VEGA study, the first randomized double bind clinical trial to assess the combination of an anti-TNF (Simponi®) with and anti-IL-23 (Tremfya®) in moderate to severe UC. In the Phase 2a proof-of-concept trial, investigators found 83.1% of patients in the treatment group achieved a clinical response and 36.6% of patients treated with the combination therapy achieved clinical remission. The high rates of clinical response and remission are both higher than the response and remission rates of patients treated with guselkumab alone (74.6%; 21.1%) and golimumab alone (61.1%; 22.2%). Hence, the IL-23 inhibition mechanism is a potentially paradigm shifting combination strategy to improve remission rates in UC. 
JNJ-2113: AN ORALLY DELIVERED IL-23R ANTAGONIST 
Janssen License and Collaboration Agreement
We have a worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Janssen to research, develop and co-detail our IL-23 receptor (“IL-23R”) antagonist compounds for all indications, including IBD. The agreement with Janssen was amended in May 2019 to expand the collaboration by supporting efforts towards second-generation IL-23R antagonists; and in July 2021 to, among other things, enable Janssen to independently research and develop collaboration compounds for multiple indications in the IL-23 pathway and further align our financial interests. See Part II, “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Overview” and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Janssen is an experienced innovator in therapeutics targeting the IL-23 pathway. Stelara® is a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-12 and IL-23 through their common p40 subunit is approved in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, CD and UC. Stelara® generated $9.1 billion in sales in 2021. Tremfya® is a specific IL-23 monoclonal antibody. It is approved in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, with Phase 3 study results in CD and UC expected in 2023. Tremfya® generated $2.1 billion in sales in 2021. In both psoriasis and IBD, there is an urgent need for safe and effective oral therapies. It is notable that Stelara® loses patent exclusivity in 2023 with biosimilar competition expected. 
JNJ-2113 (formerly known as PN-235), an orally delivered IL-23R specific antagonist for the potential treatment of psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and IBD indications, was discovered through our peptide technology platform. IL-23, a member of the IL-12 family of pro-inflammatory cytokines, is a protein that regulates inflammatory and immune function and plays a key role in the development of IBD. By blocking IL-23R, we believe JNJ-2113 may improve disease symptoms while potentially minimizing the risk of systemic side effects. During the fourth quarter of 2021, a portfolio decision was made by Janssen to advance development of our IL-R antagonist JNJ-2113. For JNJ-2113,

Janssen is primarily responsible for the conduct of all further development, and we were primarily responsible for the discovery, IND-enabling studies and the initial Phase 1 study.
​
Clinical Development of JNJ-2113 
A Phase 1 study was initiated for JNJ-2113 in December 2020. The Phase 1 study for JNJ-2113 was designed to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of JNJ-2113 in 107 healthy volunteers. The study was conducted in three parts: a SAD component, a MAD component, and a randomized, crossover solid dose comparison component. The primary endpoint was safety as measured by number and severity of adverse events. Secondary outcomes included pharmacokinetics measurements of peak concentration and area under the curve. The Phase 1 study was completed in September 2021. Results of the Phase 1 study demonstrated that administration of JNJ-2113 was well-tolerated. No serious adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of JNJ-2113 were consistent with those predicted by pre-clinical studies. 
FRONTIER1, a Phase 2b study in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, was initiated by Janssen in February 2022 and was completed in December 2022. In February 2022, Janssen initiated FRONTIER1, a 255-patient Phase 2b clinical trial of JNJ-2113 in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, which was completed in December 2022. FRONTIER1 was a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated three once-daily dosages and two twice-daily dosages of JNJ-2113 taken orally. The primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients achieving PASI-75 (a 75% improvement in skin lesions as measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) at 16 weeks. In March 2023, we announced positive topline results from the trial. JNJ-2113 achieved the study's primary efficacy endpoint, with a statistically significant greater proportion of patients who received JNJ-2113 achieving PASI-75 responses compared to placebo at Week 16 in all five of the study’s treatment groups. A clear dose response was observed across an eight-fold dose range. Treatment was well tolerated, with no meaningful difference in frequency of adverse events across treatment groups versus placebo. It is our expectation that JNJ-2113 will progress into a Phase 3 registrational study in plaque psoriasis on the strength of the FRONTIER1 data. Advancement of JNJ-2113 into a Phase 3 study and meeting the primary endpoint in that study would qualify us for milestone payments of $50 million and $115 million, respectively. Data will be presented from various pre-clinical and clinical studies on JNJ-2113 at medical conferences beginning in the second quarter of 2023.
​
Other studies of JNJ-2113 that Janssen has initiated include the SUMMIT study of JNJ-2113 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2023, and FRONTIER2, a long-term extension study. A Phase 1 trial of an immediate release formulation of JNJ-2113 in healthy Japanese and Chinese adult participants is currently recruiting. Following the completion of Phase 2 studies of JNJ-2113 in plaque psoriasis, we expect Janssen to initiate a separate Phase 2 trial of JNJ-2113 in a second indication. 
OUR PEPTIDE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM 

Our proprietary technology platform is purposefully built to exploit the advantages of constrained peptides, which are much smaller than antibody-based drugs and may be delivered orally but are big enough to bind and block the difficult targets that antibodies bind and modulate. The platform has been successfully applied to a diverse set of biological targets that has led to several pre-clinical and clinical stage peptide-based new chemical entities, including our clinical stage product candidates, for a variety of clinical indications. Our platform is comprised of a series of tools and methods, including a combination of molecular design, phage display, stability assays, medicinal chemistry, surrogate biomarkers, formulations, in vitro biochemical, cell and tissue-based assays, and in vivo pharmacology and pharmacokinetic approaches. We apply this platform to the discovery and development of constrained peptides as new drug candidates.
The platform is used to develop potential drug candidates (agonists and antagonists): (i) using the structure of a target, when available, (ii) de novo when no target structure exists, or (iii) from publicly disclosed peptide starting points. In a structure-based approach, our proprietary molecular design software and structural database of several thousand constrained peptides, termed Vectrix™, are screened to identify suitable scaffolds. The scaffolds identified form the basis of designing and constructing the first set of phage or chemical libraries. The initial hits are identified by 

13
​



either panning or screening such libraries, respectively. When structural information is unavailable for a target, hits are identified by panning a set of 34 proprietary cluster-based phage libraries consisting of millions of constrained peptides. Once the hits are identified, they are optimized using a set of peptide, peptide mimetic and medicinal chemistry techniques that include the incorporation of new or manipulation of existing cyclization-constraints, as well as natural or unnatural amino acids and chemical conjugation or acylation techniques. These techniques are applied to optimize potency, selectivity, stability, exposure and ultimately efficacy. For rusfertide, hit discovery and optimization relied exclusively on medicinal and computational chemistry, with no phage display, to develop potent and selective injectable candidates with enhanced stability and exposure in blood. For injectable products, stability in blood is determined using in vitro assay techniques to identify chemical and biological sites of degradation, which are then optimized while still maintaining potency and selectivity. Conjugation strategies are used to optimize the exposure of the injected peptide. For JNJ-2113, phage display is tightly coupled to medicinal chemistry, structural biology and oral stability techniques to develop potent, selective and orally delivered molecules. Oral stability is profiled in a series of in vitro and ex vivo assays that portray the chemical and metabolic barriers a peptide will encounter as it transits the GI and systemic compartments as needed. These metabolically labile spots in the peptides are optimized using medicinal chemistry-based approaches to engineer oral stability while maintaining selectivity and potency. Various in vivo pharmacology tools are then used to quantify peptide exposure in relevant GI and systemic compartments as needed organs and tissues. This data can be used to optimize required exposure over the required time frame to achieve in vivo efficacy. This is complemented by formulation technologies to enhance GI and systemic exposure by exploiting the intrinsic stability of our oral peptides. Finally, various biomarkers are also developed to correlate exposure with efficacy to guide candidate selection, dose selection and provide preliminary proof-of-concept of target engagement in clinical trials.
Discovery and Preclinical Activities
We believe we have built a versatile, well-validated and unique discovery platform. For example, this peptide technology platform has been used to develop product candidates for diverse target classes including G-protein-coupled receptors, ion channels, transporters, cytokines and their receptors for a variety of therapeutic areas. In the future we may tackle other GI and blood disorders and expand our technology platform to provide potential opportunities to pursue a wider variety of diseases that may include topical and systemic approaches. As an example, the gut may communicate with the immune, central nervous, and endocrine systems, providing the potential of our GI-restricted approach to treat systemic autoimmune, metabolic, cancer and cardiovascular diseases. We also intend to progress our platform to achieve systemic bioavailability and activity with oral peptides, macrocycles and peptidomimetics, thereby enabling us to address systemic diseases. Examples of this approach are our pre-clinical stage program to identify an orally active hepcidin mimetic, as was reported at the American Society for Hematology’s virtual annual meeting in December 2020, and the discovery and development of JNJ-2113, our IL-23R antagonist in collaboration with Janssen. We believe the oral hepcidin mimetic will be complementary to the injectable rusfertide for offering the best treatment options for PV, hereditary hemochromatosis and other potential erythropoietic and iron imbalance disorders.
Competition 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our product candidates, technology, knowledge and experience provide us with certain competitive advantages, we face competition from established and emerging pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others. 
Rusfertide
Ruxolitinib, marketed as Jakafi®, was approved in 2014 for the treatment of adults with PV who have inadequate response to or are intolerant to HU. Approximately 5,300 PV patients are treated with Jakafi® each year. Besremi®, a ropeginterferon alfa-2b product indicated for the treatment of adults with PV, was approved with a black box warning in November 2021. 

14
​



We are aware of other investigational compounds under clinical development for treatment of PV, including short interfering RNA approaches aimed at modulating or increasing endogenous hepcidin levels.
JNJ-2113
In psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, competition will come from companies with approved injectable agents in the IL-17 and IL-12/23 pathway including Cosentyx®, Taltz®, Siliq®, Tremfya®, and Skyrizi®. Bimekizumab (anti-IL-17A and F, UCB) has completed a positive Phase 3 program in psoriasis. Otezla® (Amgen) was the first oral agent approved in both psoriasis and PsA. The oral JAK inhibitors Xeljanz® (Pfizer) and Rinvoq® are approved in PsA but not psoriasis. Several oral small molecules that inhibit the Janus kinase Tyk2 are advancing in development. The Bristol Myers Squibb (“BMS”) TYK2 inhibitor, Sotyktu®, was approved for psoriasis in 2022. Second generation allosteric TYK2 inhibitors from Nimbus Therapeutics (recently in-licensed by Takeda Pharmaceuticals) are moving into Phase 3 development, and a molecule from Ventyx Biosciences has initiated Phase 2. Several small molecules that inhibit IL-17 have completed Phase 1 clinical development. 
In IBD, competition will come from companies with injectable agents in the anti-integrin class (Entyvio®, Takeda®, approved) and the anti-IL-12/23 class that may be approved in the next several years, including Janssen’s Stelara® (approved in UC and CD), Abbvie’s risankizumab (Skyrizi®) (UC and CD Phase 3), Janssen’s guselkumab (Tremfya®) (UC and CD); and Eli Lilly’s mirikizumab (UC and CD).
In addition, orally delivered agents with novel mechanisms of action that are approved for or in development and may be approved for UC and/or CD prior to or shortly after the launch of our product candidates can have significant impact in the competitive environment, including, 

● | JAK inhibitors: The pan-JAK tofacitinib (Xeljanz®) is approved in UC. The next-generation selective JAK1/3 inhibitors, including Abbvie’s upadacitinib (Rinvoq®) was approved in UC and CD in 2022. Pfizer’s selective JAK1/TEC inhibitor ritlecitinib is in Phase 2 development for UC and CD; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | S1P1 receptor modulators: Bristol Myers Squibb ozanimod (Zeposia®) is approved in UC. Second-generation agents including Pfizer’s etrasimod (Phase 3 UC, Phase 2b CD) are in development.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Morphic Therapeutics is developing MORF-057, an oral small molecule targeting α4β7 entering Phase 2 development in UC. Other oral small molecules targeting α4β7 from Gilead and EA Pharma are in early clinical development. Many other agents are in early-stage development in IBD, including injectable anti-TLIA antibodies by Pfizer and Prometheus, which have both recently presented positive Phase 2 results in UC.
Both the psoriasis and IBD market will be impacted by the launch of biosimilars for Humira® and Stelara® in 2023.
Material Agreements 
Janssen License and Collaboration Agreement
On July 27, 2021, we entered into an amended and restated License and Collaboration Agreement (the “Restated Agreement”) with Janssen, which amended and restated the License and Collaboration Agreement effective July 13, 2017, by and between us and Janssen (the “Original Agreement”), as amended by the First Amendment thereto, effective May 7, 2019 (the “First Amendment”). Janssen is a related party to us as Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc., a significant stockholder of ours, and Janssen are both subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson. Upon the effectiveness of the Original Agreement, we received a non-refundable, upfront cash payment of $50.0 million from Janssen. Upon the effectiveness of the First Amendment in 2019, we received a $25.0 million payment from Janssen in 2019. We received a $5.0 million payment triggered by the successful nomination of a second-generation IL-23R antagonist development compound during the first quarter of 2020, and we received a $7.5 million payment for completion of data collection

activities for the first Phase 1 clinical trial of a second-generation compound during the fourth quarter of 2021. We received a $25.0 million payment during the second quarter of 2022 triggered by the dosing of a third patient in FRONTIER1. See Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Overview” and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 
Research Collaboration and License Agreement with Zealand Pharma A/S
​
In June 2012, we entered into a Research Collaboration and License Agreement (the “Zealand Agreement”) with Zealand Pharma A/S (“Zealand”) to identify, optimize and develop novel disulfide-rich peptides to discover a hepcidin mimetic. We amended this agreement on February 28, 2014, at which point Protagonist assumed responsibility for the development program. See Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments” and Note 7 and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 
​
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology platform and on know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of peptide-based therapeutics that may be important for the development of our business. We will also take advantage of regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available.
Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same. For more information, please see Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
We own or co-own 15 issued U.S. patents, over 60 granted ex-U.S. patents, and numerous U.S. and ex-U.S. patent applications related to our clinical assets. We possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the discovery, development and commercialization of peptide based therapeutic products. Our proprietary intellectual property, including patent and non-patent intellectual property, is generally directed to, for example, peptide-based therapeutic compounds and compositions, methods of using these peptide-based therapeutic compounds and compositions to treat or prevent disease, methods of manufacturing peptide-based therapeutic compounds and compositions, and other proprietary technologies and processes related to our lead product development candidates. Specific patents and patent applications are directed to compositions of α4β7 integrin peptides, IL-23R antagonist peptides, and hepcidin and enkephalin mimetics peptides, as well as methods of synthesizing and using these peptides to treat inflammatory disorders. Applications are currently pending in the United States and other major jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, China, Japan, and Europe. We expect our patents and patent applications, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees are paid, to expire from October 2033 to July 2041 (excluding possible patent term extensions).
Our objective is to continue to expand our portfolio of patents and patent applications in order to protect our clinical assets and related peptide-based drug technologies.

16
​



We also license patents and patent applications directed to processes and methods related to our technology platform. These patents have issued in the United States and other major jurisdictions, including Australia and Europe. Some licensed patents are expired, and others are expected to expire before or by February 2023. Material aspects of our technology platform are protected by trade secrets and confidentiality agreements.
In addition to the above, we have established expertise and development capabilities focused in the areas of pre-clinical research and development, manufacturing and manufacturing process scale-up, quality control, quality assurance, regulatory affairs and clinical trial design and implementation. We believe that our focus and expertise will help us develop products based on our proprietary intellectual property.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent.
The term of a patent that covers an FDA approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Moreover, a patent can only be extended once, and thus, if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use.
Trade Secrets
We rely on trade secrets to protect certain aspects of our technology, particularly in relation to our technology platform. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For more information, please see Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Manufacturing 
​
We contract with third parties for the manufacturing of our product candidates for pre-clinical and clinical studies and eventually for commercial supplies and intend to continue to do so in the future. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and we have no plans to build any owned clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. We believe that the use of contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) eliminates the need for us to directly invest in manufacturing facilities, equipment and additional staff. We have established a global supply chain for raw material, active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”), drug product manufacturing and distribution. We work with contract manufacturers in the United States, Europe and Asia. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, our personnel and consultants have extensive manufacturing and quality control experience overseeing CMOs. We regularly consider second source or back-up manufacturers for both API and drug product manufacturing. To date, our third-party manufacturers have met the manufacturing requirements for our product candidates. We expect third-party manufacturers to be capable of providing supplies needed for our product candidates to meet anticipated full-scale 

17
​



commercial demands, and we have selected CMOs that can manufacture our product candidates for our ongoing and planned clinical trials as well as commercial supplies. We currently engage CMOs on a “fee for services” basis for our current development and clinical supplies. 
Government Regulation
​
The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs, such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our product candidates.
U.S. Government Regulation
​
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending new drug applications (“NDAs”), withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practices regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice (“GCP”) requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an NDA (or Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for a biologic product);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements and the clinical protocol; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18
​




● | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

Pre-clinical Studies
​
Pre-clinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. These pre-clinical studies must comply with good laboratory practices (“GLP”). An IND sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature to the FDA as part of an IND. Some pre-clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold. In such case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
​
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements. GCP requirements mandate that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND (or equivalent international submission). In addition, an IRB or ethics committee (“EC”) must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial at all institutions participating in the clinical trial before it commences at that site. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific time frames to the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) for public dissemination on www.clinicaltrials.gov.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

● | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and is tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the investigational drug product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate labeling information (labeling) for the safe and efficacious administration for the labeling of the product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB or EC can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.

Following successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the pre-clinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to an application user fee. Under the 

19
​



Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) guidelines, the FDA has a target of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (“PREA”) certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. REMS plans typically include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the requested information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. After the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or pre-clinical testing for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even after submission of this additional information, the FDA may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product. It may also require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling or require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval. In addition, the FDA may mandate testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS. This can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of 

20
​



alterations, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Fast Track Designation
​
The FDA has various programs, such as fast track designation. These programs are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs for the treatment of serious or life threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients faster. The sponsor of a new drug may request fast track designation concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND. To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. A product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety. Fast track designation provides additional opportunities for interaction with the FDA’s review team and may allow for rolling review of NDA components before the completed application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. However, the FDA’s time goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. The FDA may decide to rescind the fast track designation if it determines that the qualifying criteria no longer apply.
​
Orphan Designation
​
The FDA may grant orphan designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. The FDA may also grant the designation if the disease affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and marketing the product for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
In the United States, orphan designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same product for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances. Such circumstances include a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer with orphan exclusivity is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the approved orphan designated product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity.
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
​
A sponsor can request designation of a drug candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated 

21
​



approval and priority review. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. The FDA may decide to rescind the breakthrough designation if it determines that the qualifying criteria no longer apply.
Post-Approval Requirements
​
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA. These regulations include requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program user fee requirements for any marketed products.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies. They are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse side effects of unanticipated severity or frequency, problems with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under an REMS program. Other potential consequences include:

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved prescribing information. The FDA and other agencies enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.

22
​



Coverage and Reimbursement
​
Sales of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the cost of such products will be covered and adequately reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed health care organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage and reducing reimbursements for medical products and services by challenging the prices and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
There is no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for drug products among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. Coverage determination can be a time-consuming and costly process that may require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained or applied consistently. Even if reimbursement is provided, market acceptance of our products may be adversely affected if the amount of payment for our products proves to be unprofitable for health care providers or less profitable than alternative treatments, or due to administrative burdens.
In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of our products candidates, once approved, and have a material adverse effect on our sales.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively referred to as the ACA, enacted in March 2010, has had and is expected to continue to have a significant impact on the health care industry. The ACA imposes a significant annual fee on certain companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. The ACA also increased the Medicaid rebate rate and expanded the rebate program to include Medicaid managed care organizations. It also contains substantial new provisions intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce the growth of health care spending, enhance remedies against health care fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the health care industry, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms, any or all of which may affect our business. 
There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, President Trump signed several Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain ACA requirements or otherwise circumvent some of the health insurance mandates. Concurrently, Congress considered legislation to repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been enacted. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, included a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on some individuals who do not maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year. Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and the medical device tax, and also eliminated the health insurance tax. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 amends the ACA to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”, and increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in the Medicare Part D program. The IRA, enacted August 16, 2022, aims to control prescription drug prices in the upcoming years. The IRA will allow the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) to cap out-of-pocket costs in 2025 and to negotiate prescription drug prices in 2026 for the first time. Additionally, the IRA provides a new “inflation rebate” covering Medicare patients to take effect in 2023 to prevent rapid and arbitrary price increases in prescription drugs. These and any other legislation or healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration may impact the ACA and our business. There may also be 

23
​



further challenges to the ACA, and new laws may also result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding.



Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. This scrutiny has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the Trump administration implemented drug pricing reform through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempt to implement several of the administration’s proposals The FDA also released a final rule, effective November 30, 2020, implementing a portion of the importation executive order providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule was delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers.
Federal and state legislatures have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare therapies. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
It is uncertain whether and how future legislation, whether domestic or foreign, could affect prospects for our product candidates or what actions payors for health care treatment and services may take in response to such health care reform proposals or legislation. Adoption of price controls and other cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures reforms may prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates.
Other Health Care Laws and Compliance Requirements
​
We will also be subject to health care regulation and enforcement by the federal and state government and foreign governments in which we will conduct our business once our products are approved. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic health care transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; the criminal health care fraud statutes under HIPAA also prohibits persons and entities from knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payors, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services; the Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal health care programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; federal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws that prohibit any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid; and the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the HHS information related to 

24
​



payments and other transfers of value made to various healthcare professionals including physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. We may be subject to state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. In addition, we may be subject to reporting requirements under state transparency laws, as well as state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government that otherwise restricts certain payments that may be made to health care providers and entities. In addition, certain states and local jurisdictions require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exceptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If we are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, exclusion of products from reimbursement under U.S. federal or state health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
Government Regulation Outside of the United States 
​
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing clinical studies and any commercial sales and distribution of our products.
Drug and Biologic Development Process in the European Union (“EU”)
All clinical trials included in applications for marketing authorization for human medicines in the EU must be carried out in accordance with EU regulations. This means that such clinical trials must comply with EU clinical trial legislation, as well as ethical principles equivalent to those set out in the EEA, including adhering to international good clinical practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. The conduct of clinical trials in the EU is governed by the EU Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No. 536/2014 (“CTR”) which entered into force on January 31, 2022. 
Under the CTR, a sponsor may submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial through a centralized EU clinical trials portal. One national regulatory authority (the reporting EU Member State proposed by the applicant) will take the lead in validating and evaluating the application consult and coordinate with the other concerned Member States. If an application is rejected, it may be amended and resubmitted through the EU clinical trials portal. If an approval is issued, the sponsor may start the clinical trial in all concerned Member States. However, a concerned EU Member State may in limited circumstances declare an “opt-out” from an approval and prevent the clinical trial from being conducted in such Member State. The CTR also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting, and introduces enhanced transparency requirements such as mandatory submission of a summary of the clinical trial results to the EU Database. 
National laws, regulations, and the applicable GCP and Good Laboratory Practice standards must also be respected during the conduct of the trials, including the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (“ICH”) guidelines on Good Clinical Practice and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

25
​



Drug Marketing Authorization 
In the EU and in Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein (together, the European Economic Area or “EEA”), after completion of all required clinical testing, pharmaceutical products may only be placed on the market after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (“MA”). To obtain an MA of a drug under EU regulatory systems, an applicant can submit a Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”) through, amongst others, a centralized or decentralized procedure.
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single MA that is issued by the European Commission (“EC”) following the scientific assessment of the application by the EMA that is valid for all EU Member States as well as in the three additional EEA Member States. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific medicinal products, including for medicines developed by means of certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products (“ATMP”) and medicinal products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases (AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune and viral diseases). For medicinal products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA before May 20, 2004 and indicated for the treatment of other diseases, medicinal products that constitute significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovations or for which the grant of a MA through the centralized procedure would be in the interest of public health at EU level, an applicant may voluntarily submit an application for a marketing authorization through the centralized procedure.
Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”), established at the EMA, is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a drug. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the CHMP is, in principle, 210 days from receipt of a valid MAA. However, this timeline excludes clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP, so the overall process typically takes a year or more, unless the application is eligible for an accelerated assessment. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. Upon request, the CHMP can reduce the time frame to 150 days if the applicant provides sufficient justification for an accelerated assessment. The CHMP will provide a positive opinion regarding the application only if it meets certain quality, safety and efficacy requirements. This opinion is then transmitted to the EC, which has the ultimate authority for granting MA within 67 days after receipt of the CHMP opinion.
Medicines that fall outside the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure have three routes to authorization: (i) they can be authorized under the centralized procedure if they concern a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if their authorization would be in the interest of public health; (ii) they can be authorized under a decentralized procedure where an applicant applies for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU Member State; or (iii) they can be authorized in an EU Member State in accordance with that state’s national procedures and then be authorized in other EU countries by a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization (mutual recognition procedure).
The decentralized procedure permits companies to file identical MA applications for a medicinal product to the competent authorities in various EU Member States simultaneously if such medicinal product has not received marketing approval in any EU Member State before. The competent authority of a single EU Member State, known as the reference EU Member State, is appointed to review the application and provide an assessment report. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference EU Member State and concerned EU Member States. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Subsequently, each concerned EU Member State must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If an EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are subject to a dispute resolution mechanism and may eventually be referred to the EC, whose decision is binding for all EU Member States.
All new MAAs must include a Risk Management Plan (“RMP”), describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. 

26
​



RMPs are continually modified and updated throughout the lifetime of the medicine as new information becomes available. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. 
Marketing Authorizations have an initial duration of five years. After these five years, the authorization may subsequently be renewed on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance. Once renewed, the MA is valid for an unlimited period unless the EC or the national competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with only one additional five-year renewal. Applications for renewal must be made to the EMA at least nine months before the five-year period expires.
European Data Protection Laws
The collection and use of personal health data and other personal data in the EU is governed by the provisions of the European General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”). The GDPR imposes strict requirements on the processing of personal data, including the legal basis for the processing, the information that has to be provided to individuals before their data is processed, notification obligations to national data protection authorities, and the technical and organization measures to ensure the security and confidentiality of the personal data. EU Member States may also have additional requirements for health, genetic, and biometric data through their national legislation. The GDPR also imposes restrictions on the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EU that do not provide an adequate level of data protection. To enable such transfers, appropriate safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses (“SCCs”), must be in place. 
Environmental, Social, Governance and Human Capital Disclosures
​
Governance and Leadership
​
Our commitment to integrating sustainability across our organization begins with our board of directors, which has oversight of strategy and risk management related to Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”).
​
Business Ethics
​
We are committed to creating an environment where we are able to excel in our business while maintaining the highest standards of business conduct and ethics. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (“Code of Conduct”) reflects the business practices and principles of behavior that supports this commitment, including our policies on bribery, corruption, conflicts of interest, insider trading, and our whistleblower program. We expect all of our directors, officers, and employees to read, understand, and comply with the Code of Conduct and its application to the performance of his or her business responsibilities.
​
Environmental Commitment
​
We are committed to protecting the environment and attempt to mitigate any negative impact of our operations, promoting reuse and recycling and conserving resources, where feasible. We have safety protocols in place for handling biohazardous waste in our operations, including in our clinical trials, and we use third-party vendors for biohazardous waste and chemical disposal.
​
Social Responsibility
​
We are committed to providing patients with access to our investigational therapies, to the extent appropriate at the development stage. We are currently focused on our clinical programs and getting our therapies through the approval process and approved as rapidly as possible provided they are shown to be safe and effective. We provide access to our investigational therapies through our clinical trials, including in some cases long-term extensions of those trials that provide access to our therapies for up to several years. We also support educational efforts related to therapeutic areas in focus for our company, and life sciences education more broadly. In addition to financial support of continuing 

27
​



education, we are active sponsors, mentors, and hosts for students seeking to broaden their understanding of life sciences in the interest of advancing human health.
Human Capital 
​
As of December 31, 2022, we had 105 full-time equivalent employees, 82 of whom were in research and development, of which 3 hold an M.D. and 24 hold Ph.D. degrees. The remaining 23 employees worked in finance, legal, business development, human resources and administrative support, of which one holds a Ph.D. 97 of our full-time equivalent employees are located in the United States and 8 are located in Australia. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. We track and report internally on key talent metrics including workforce demographics, diversity data and the status of open positions. We are committed to equality, inclusion and diversity in the workplace. As of December 31, 2022, nearly 70% of our workforce identify as members of underrepresented ethnic communities and 55% identify as female. We strive to interview diverse candidates for our open positions.
Attracting, developing and retaining talented employees to support the growth of our business is an integral part of our human capital strategy and critical to our long-term success. We continue to seek targeted additions to our staff, although the competition in our industry and in the San Francisco Bay Area where our headquarters is located is significant. The principal purpose of our equity incentive and annual bonus programs is to attract, retain and motivate personnel through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards. As a biopharmaceutical company, we recognize the importance of access to high quality healthcare and as such we cover 100% of our employees’ monthly healthcare premiums. We offer a package of competitive employee benefits, including 401(k) plan matching contributions and an employee stock purchase plan. 
We have a performance development review process in which managers provide regular feedback to assist with the development of our employees, including the use of individual plans to assist with career development. We also invest in the growth and development of our employees through various training and development programs that help build and strengthen our employees’ leadership and professional skills. Approximately 20% of our employees are promoted each year. This reflects the quality and readiness of our people to take on new roles, as well as our intentional focus on growing and developing careers, as well as promoting within.
Safeguarding the health and safety of our employees is a top priority. We are committed to providing a safe working environment for all of our employees. Our cross-functional safety committee meets regularly to discuss policies and protocols, strategic planning, business continuity and other matters related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential impacts on our company, employees and external stakeholders. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This includes having our non-laboratory employees work remotely at least part-time, while implementing additional safety measures for laboratory and other employees continuing critical on-site work. To support our employees personally and professionally, we have Employee Assistance Programs to address employee challenges and needs.
