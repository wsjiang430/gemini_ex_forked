ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

History and Organization
Gold Resource Corporation was organized under the laws of Colorado, USA on August 24, 1998. Since 2010, GRC has produced gold and silver doré and copper, lead, and zinc concentrates in Oaxaca, Mexico at our subsidiary, Don David Gold Mexico S.A. de C.V. (“Don David Gold Mine” or “DDGM”). The Don David Gold Mine holds six (6) properties which are all located in what is known as the San Jose structural corridor. Our properties span 55 continuous kilometers of this structural corridor which include three historic mining districts in Oaxaca.
On December 10, 2021, the Company successfully completed the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding common shares of Aquila Resources Inc (the “Aquila Transaction”). Aquila’s principal asset is its 100% interest in the Back Forty Project located in Menominee County, Michigan, USA. The Back Forty Project has a polymetallic (gold, silver, copper, lead, and zinc) Volcanogenic Massive Sulfide deposit. The Back Forty Project controls surface and mineral rights through ownership and leases with the State of Michigan. The company is currently advancing work on an optimized feasibility study, followed by permit applications.
In this report, “Company,” “GRC,” “our,” “us,” and “we” refer to Gold Resource Corporation together with its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. See the glossary for additional definitions.

Mexico Production Stage Properties:
The primary production stage properties at DDGM commenced operations in 2010. The current operations include the Arista underground mine and the DDGM processing facility. The DDGM processing facility currently produces doré and metal concentrates from ore mined at the Arista Mine. The Arista Mine was expanded in 2016 with the development of the Switchback vein system. The Arista Mine portal is located approximately two kilometers from the processing facility. Additionally, underground mining at the Alta Gracia mine was conducted from 2017 to 2019. Alta Gracia is approximately 32 kilometers from the processing facilities. 
The Arista and Alta Gracia mines include a total of approximately 30,000 hectares of mining concessions, access roads from a major highway, haul roads, a processing facility and adjoining buildings, an assay lab, a now depleted open pit, underground mines, tailings facilities, and other infrastructure. Please see Item 2. Properties for additional information.

Mexico Exploration Prospects:
Within the 55-kilometer-long San Jose structural corridor, in Oaxaca, Mexico, sits a highly prospective ground package. Multiple volcanic domes of various scales, and likely non-vented intrusive domes, dominate the district geology. These volcanogenic features are imposed on a pre-volcanic basement of sedimentary rocks. Gold and silver, as well as base metal mineralization in this district is related to the manifestations of this classic volcanogenic system and is considered epithermal in character. The Company intends to advance organic growth and to unlock the value of the mine,

existing infrastructure, and our large property position by continuing to invest in exploration and development. Please see Item 2. Properties for additional information.
Back Forty Project:
There is a long history of exploration, and studies being performed at the Back Forty Project. In 2014, a Preliminary Feasibility Study prepared under Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (“NI 43-101”) was completed which contemplated an open pit mine and processing operation. In October 2019, Aquila filed a NI 43-101 Feasibility Study which estimated the open pit project would produce 1.1 million gold equivalent ounces over a seven-year mine life. Over the next couple of years, the necessary permits were obtained. In August 2020, a Preliminary Economic Assessment was published. In January 2021, the water permit was revoked due to a technicality related to a contingent condition established in the permit. In 2021, an optimized feasibility study was initiated to address the mine’s footprint, potential for an underground mine, wetland mitigation, and other key construction and design decisions. The feasibility study is ongoing with permitting planned to follow. Please see Item 2. Properties for additional information.
Administrative Offices:
Our principal executive offices are located at 7900 E. Union Ave, Suite 320, Denver, Colorado 80237, and our telephone number is (303) 320-7708. The Company maintains a website at www.goldresourcecorp.com. Information on our website is not incorporated into this annual report on Form 10-K and is not a part of this report.

Before the Aquila Transaction, Aquila’s common shares were traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) under the ticker symbol AQA. Effective December 10, 2021, Aquila ceased to be a reporting issuer in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, and Nova Scotia. At the same time, GRC became a reporting issuer in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, and Nova Scotia by virtue of the completion of the acquisition. As a Canadian Issuer, GRC is now required to file reports on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (“SEDAR”) in Canada. All financial statements filed on SEDAR will conform to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”).

2022 Developments
For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company reported a net loss of $6.3 million. The loss is mainly a result of the Company’s investment in the Back Forty Project and higher depreciation, depletion, and amortization at DDGM. Financial results for 2022 include revenue of $138.7 million and mine gross profit of $29.7 million. The Company achieved solid production results for the year totaling 34,122 gold ounces, 1,213,404 silver ounces, 1,436 copper tonnes, 6,665 lead tonnes, and 17,943 zinc tonnes despite DDGM experiencing some ground support challenges. Production, mine development, and exploration at the mine were temporarily slowed in the third and fourth quarters of 2022 to improve safety specific to ground support and ventilation.

Eighth consecutiveESR award

​




The Company published its 2022 inaugural Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) Report on March 8, 2023. For the eighth consecutive year, the Don David Gold Mine received the prestigious ESR award from the Mexican Center for Philanthropy (“CEMEFI”). Awards are given to organizations that demonstrate a commitment to supporting social and environmental protection programs within their local communities.
Our 2022 exploration activities were focused on drilling at the Arista and Switchback vein systems in the Arista Mine. We completed 182 underground diamond drill holes totaling 34,829 meters, including 24 expansion drill holes totaling 11,969 meters and 158 infill drill holes totaling 22,860 meters inside the Arista mine during 2022. During 2022, we completed 1,001 meters of drift development to position us for a successful 2023 drilling program.
The Arista system drill program targeted the delineation of multiple high-grade narrow veins up- and down-dip of existing workings to define additional Mineral Reserves. The Switchback drill program, including the Three Sisters vein system, targeted the expansion and delineation of multiple high-grade parallel veins to define additional Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources. Surface exploration activity focused on the Alta Gracia property with surface mapping and a soil geochemistry sampling program undertaken in an area to the south and southeast of the historical Independencia mine operations. This work identified several targets for follow-up exploration activity. Our exploration efforts demonstrate our commitment to long-term investment in Oaxaca, Mexico.
For the Back Forty Project, work continued throughout 2022 on an optimized feasibility study. The engineering team continues to evaluate and improve all aspects of the project design and the basis of estimates. Trade-off studies, improved estimates, and improved metallurgical recovery work are ongoing and expected to be completed in the first half of 2023. Pending favorable results, the Company will apply for all necessary permits. The Company continues to monitor a Petition by the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin (MITW) to have an area along the Menominee River, which includes a portion of the mine area, registered as a cultural landscape with the Keeper of the National Register of Historic Places. We are also monitoring the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ review of a petition by the MITW to have the Menominee River designated as Navigable under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbor Act.

The table above contains forward-looking projections about our financial condition, results of operations, and business. These projections are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, and uncertainties, which are discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Because these projections are subject to risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Non-GAAP Measures below for a discussion of the calculation of Cash Costs per Ounce and All-in Sustaining Costs per Ounce, which are non-GAAP measures.
Dividends 
During 2022, we paid dividends of $0.04 per share. In February 2023, we announced the suspension of our quarterly dividend until such time that it may become practicable to reinstate. Please see Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchase of Equity Securities for additional information regarding our Dividend Policy.
Insurance


Our business is capital intensive and requires ongoing investment for the replacement, modernization, or expansion of equipment and facilities. For more information, please see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources, below. We maintain insurance policies against

property loss and business interruption and insure against most risks that are typical in the operation of our business in amounts that we believe to be reasonable. Such insurance, however, contains exclusions and limitations on coverage, particularly with respect to property loss, environmental liability, and political risk. There can be no assurance that claims would be paid under such insurance policies in connection with a particular event. Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors, below for additional information.
Competitive Business Conditions
The acquisition of gold and silver properties is subject to intense competition. Identifying and evaluating potential mining prospects is a costly and time-consuming endeavor. In 2021, we successfully acquired the Back Forty Project as discussed above. We expect to continue our significant investment in exploration and growth activities in the future; however, competition for acquiring mineral prospects will continue to be intense.

Government Regulations and Permits 
In connection with mining, milling, and exploration activities in Mexico, we are subject to Mexican federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, including laws and regulations relating to the protection of air and water quality, hazardous waste management, mine reclamation, as well as the protection of endangered or threatened species. The government department responsible for environmental protection in Mexico is Secretaria de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (“SEMARNAT”). SEMARNAT has broad authority over environmental regulations and standards. Potential areas of environmental consideration for mining companies, such as ours, include but are not limited to acid rock drainage, cyanide containment and handling, contamination of water sources, dust, and noise.
For operations at our Don David Gold Mine, we have secured and continue to maintain various regulatory permits from federal, state, and local agencies. These governmental and regulatory permits generally govern the processes being used to operate, the stipulations concerning air quality, water issues, hazardous and waste management, and the plans and obligations for reclamation of the properties at the conclusion of operations. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. 
Our production stage mines in Mexico have reclamation plans in place that we believe meet all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. As of December 31, 2022, $10.4 million has been accrued on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for reclamation costs relating to our production and exploration stage properties in Mexico.
The State of Michigan has been delegated authority under federal environmental law to issue all necessary environmental permits required for the Back Forty project. The State of Michigan’s “Natural Resource Environmental Protection Act” provides rules and regulations for the State Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) to issue permits for mining, treated wastewater discharge, air emissions, and related environmental permits necessary for the project. 


Customers
During the year ended December 31, 2022, two customers accounted for 84% of our revenue from DDGM. In the event that our relationship with any of the customers is interrupted for any reason, we believe that we would be able to locate another entity to purchase our products in a timely manner on substantially similar terms. However, any interruption could temporarily disrupt the sale of our principal products and materially adversely affect our operating results. We periodically review our options for alternative sales outlets to mitigate the concentration of risk in case of any unforeseen disruptions.
Human Capital Resources
We value excellence and recognize that embracing the diverse backgrounds, skills, and perspectives of the workforce will lead to a competitive advantage. We are committed to leading by example and maintaining a fair and

inclusive work environment built on mutual respect and integrity. Diversity means understanding, accepting, respecting, and valuing differences among people regardless of age, gender, race, ethnicity, culture, religion or spiritual practices, disabilities, sexual orientation, gender identity, family status, or veteran status.
We believe we have good morale and a dedicated workforce. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing employees and new hires. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain, and motivate selected employees and directors by granting stock-based compensation awards that align employee compensation with shareholder returns.

DDGM Employees

​
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 16 full-time corporate employees, and three of them serve as executive officers. Additionally, we had six full-time employees in Michigan who are fully dedicated to progressing the Back Forty Project.
On April 23, 2021, the Federation’s Official Gazette published a decree that reformed labor outsourcing in Mexico. Operating companies can no longer source labor resources used to carry out their core business functions from service entities or third-party providers. As a result of this transition, DDGM employed approximately 530 employees at the end of 2021 and 565 employees at the end of 2022. Under Mexican law, employees are entitled to receive statutory profit sharing (Participacion a los Trabajadores de las Utilidades or “PTU”) payments. PTU payments for 2022 are expected to be approximately $2.2 million and be paid in the first half of 2023.
