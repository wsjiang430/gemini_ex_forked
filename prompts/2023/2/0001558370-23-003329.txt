Item 1. Business
Description of the Business
We are a global restaurant company that develops, owns and operates, manages and licenses upscale and polished casual, high-energy restaurants and lounges and provides turn-key food and beverage (“F&B”) services and consulting service for hospitality venues including hotels, casinos and other high-end locations. Turn-key F&B services are food and beverage services that can be scaled, customized and implemented by us for the client at a particular hospitality venue. Our vision is to be a global market leader in the hospitality industry by melding high-quality service, ambiance, high-energy and cuisine into one great experience that we refer to as “Vibe Dining”. We design all our restaurants, lounges and F&B services to create a social dining and high-energy entertainment experience within a destination location. We believe that this design and operating philosophy separates us from more traditional restaurant and foodservice competitors.

Our primary restaurant brands are STK, a multi-unit steakhouse concept that combines a high-energy, social atmosphere with the quality and service of a traditional upscale steakhouse, and Kona Grill, a polished casual bar-centric grill concept featuring American favorites, award-winning sushi, and specialty cocktails in a polished casual atmosphere. Our F&B hospitality management services are marketed as ONE Hospitality and include developing, managing and operating restaurants, bars, rooftop lounges, pools, banqueting and catering facilities, private dining rooms, room service and mini bars tailored to the specific needs of high-end hotels and casinos. We also provide hospitality advisory and consulting services to certain clients. Our F&B hospitality clients operate global hospitality brands such as the W Hotel, ME Hotel, Hippodrome Casino, and Curio Collection by Hilton.

We opened our first restaurant in January 2004 in New York, New York. We currently own, operate, manage or license 63 venues including 25 STKs and 25 Kona Grills in major metropolitan cities in North America, Europe and the Middle East and 13 F&B venues in six hotels and casinos in the United States and Europe. We intend to open eight to twelve new venues in 2023, including a Kona Grill restaurant in Columbus, OH which opened in January 2023. There are currently three Company-owned STK restaurants (Charlotte, NC, Boston, MA and Washington D.C.) and two Company-owned Kona Grill restaurants (Riverton, UT and Phoenix, AZ) under construction.

​
We expect to continue expanding our operations domestically and internationally primarily through a mix of owned, licensed and managed restaurants using a disciplined and targeted site selection process. We refer to our licensing and management strategy as our “capital light strategy” because it requires significantly less capital than expansion through owned restaurants only. Refer to Item 2 – Properties for additional details regarding the domestic and international locations in which we operate.
STK
STK is a global steakhouse restaurant concept with locations in major metropolitan cities. STK artfully blends the modern steakhouse and a chic lounge, offering a high-energy, fine dining experience in a social atmosphere with the quality and service of a traditional upscale steakhouse. Each STK location features a large, open restaurant and bar area with a DJ playing music throughout the restaurant, offering our customers a high-energy, fun “destination” environment that encourages social interaction. We believe this Vibe Dining concept truly differentiates us from other upscale steakhouses. Our menu provides a variety of portion sizes and signature options to appeal to a broad customer demographic. 
We operate thirteen owned, seven managed and five licensed STK restaurants in North America, Europe and the Middle East. Our STK restaurants average approximately 10,000 square feet, and we typically target locations that range in size from 8,000 to 10,000 square feet. In 2022, the average domestic restaurant revenues and average domestic check per person for owned and managed STK restaurants that have been open at least 18 months at December 31, 2022 were $19.1 million and $131, respectively.
We are focused on expanding our global STK footprint. We believe that the locations of our STK restaurants are critical to our long-term success, and we devote significant time and resources to analyze prospective restaurant sites. We intend to continue our focus on (i) metropolitan areas with demographic and discretionary spending profiles that favor our high-end concept and (ii) finding partners with excellent track records and brand recognition. We also consider factors such as traffic patterns, proximity to high-end shopping areas and office buildings, hotels and convention centers,

area restaurant competition, accessibility and visibility. We have identified over 75 additional major metropolitan areas across the globe where we could grow our STK brand to 200 restaurants over the foreseeable future. We expect to open five to six STKs annually.
Kona Grill
Kona Grill is a bar-centric grill concept featuring American favorites, steaks, seafood, award-winning sushi, and specialty cocktails in a polished casual atmosphere. Kona Grill offers freshly prepared food and attentive service in an upscale, contemporary ambiance that creates an exceptional dining experience that we believe exceeds many traditional casual dining restaurants. Menu items are crafted to have memorable flavor profiles that appeal to a wide range of customers. The diverse menu is complemented by a full-service bar offering a broad assortment of wines, craft cocktails, and beers. We believe that the Kona Grill brand is complementary to our STK brand and enables us to capture market share in the Vibe Dining segment.
We own and operate 25 Kona Grill restaurants within 17 states in the United States. Our Kona Grill restaurants average approximately 7,000 to 8,000 square feet. In 2022, the average restaurant revenues were $5.3 million and average spend per transaction was $61. We believe we can grow the Kona Grill brand to 200 restaurants over the foreseeable future. We expect to open three to five Kona Grills annually.
ONE Hospitality
Our ONE Hospitality platform is composed of our F&B hospitality management and consulting agreements with hotels, casinos, and other high-end locations as well as our other brands and venue concepts, which are described below:

● | F&B Services. Our F&B services for hospitality venues provide attractive and comprehensive tailored food and beverage solutions to our hospitality clients. Our fee-based hospitality food and beverage solutions include developing, managing and operating restaurants, bars, rooftops, pools, banquet and catering services, private dining rooms, in-room dining services and mini bars on a contract basis. Currently, we operate five venues pursuant to F&B hospitality management agreements with hotels and casinos in the United States and in Europe. Historically, our clients have provided the majority of the capital required for the development of the facilities we manage on their behalf.

​
Our F&B hospitality contracts generate revenues for us through management fees, which are typically calculated as a percentage of the operation’s revenues, and we earn additional milestone and incentive fees based on the operation’s profitability. We typically target F&B hospitality service opportunities where we believe we can generate at least $500,000 of annual pre-tax income.

4




We expect our F&B hospitality services business to be an important driver of our growth and profitability, enabling us to generate leads to develop managed STK restaurants and management fee income with minimal capital expenditures. We believe we are well positioned to leverage the strength of our brands and the relationships we have developed with global hospitality providers to drive the continued growth of our F&B hospitality business. We continue to receive inbound inquiries regarding new opportunities globally, and we continue to work with existing hospitality clients to identify and develop additional opportunities in their venues. We expect to enter into one to two new F&B hospitality agreements annually.
We exercised our option to renew the management agreement with ME London to manage STK, Radio, Marconi and in-room dining. Effective January 1, 2023, ME London elected not to renew Radio, Marconi and in-room dining per the agreement. Therefore, we will continue to manage the STK restaurant at ME London.
Sourcing and Supply Chain
We seek to ensure that consistently high-quality food and beverages are served at all of our venues through the coordination and cooperation of our purchasing and culinary teams.
Our culinary and purchasing teams establish product specifications on a global basis, which are then disseminated to all locations through recipe books for all dishes served at our properties. We are committed to culinary innovation which allows us flexibility in our preparations and offerings in order to manage costs and ensure regular availability.
We maintain consistent pricing standards and procedures for all top-volume purchases at our restaurants. 
We select high quality suppliers and negotiate pricing on a national level in each country where one or more of our restaurants operate. We test new suppliers on a regional basis for an extended period before using them on a national basis. We periodically review supplier consistency and satisfaction with our location chefs and continually research and evaluate products and supplies to ensure the meat, seafood and other menu ingredients that we purchase comply with our high-quality specifications. We believe we have strong relationships with national and regional foodservice distributors who can continue to supply us with our products on a consistent basis. Products are shipped directly to the restaurants from our suppliers.
Our corporate beverage program establishes guidelines for ordering beverage products at our properties. We provide beverage managers at each location with national guidelines for standardized products. Our concepts emphasize the bar as a driver of activity in the restaurants and in 2022, the sale of beverages accounted for approximately 24% of restaurant revenues.
On a company-wide basis, no supplier of food accounts for more than 35% of our total food and beverage purchases and no brand of alcohol accounts for more than 25% of our alcohol purchases. We believe that our food and beverage supplies are available from a significant number of alternate suppliers and that the loss of a supplier would not have a material adverse effect on our costs of supplies.
Advertising and Marketing
The primary focus of our advertising and marketing is to increase awareness of our brands and our overall reputation for quality, service and delivering a high-energy experience. Our marketing efforts are designed to strengthen our brand recognition in markets where we operate and to create brand awareness in new markets before opening a new location. We use digital/social media channels, targeted local media such as magazines, billboards and other out-of-home advertising, and a strong network of public relations teams to increase the frequency with which our existing customers visit our restaurants and to attract new customers. We conduct frequent promotional programs tailored to the city, brand and clientele of each location. We utilize a network of local and national public relations firms to support these promotional programs. Additional marketing functions include the use of our websites, www.STKsteakhouse.com and www.KonaGrill.com, to facilitate online reservations, to-go/delivery orders and gift card sales to drive revenue.
Competition
The restaurant and hospitality industries are intensely competitive with respect to price, quality of service, location, ambiance of facilities and type and quality of food. We experience competition from a variety of sources, including upscale steakhouse chains such as Ruth Chris, Del Frisco’s, Fleming’s, Mastro’s and The Capital Grille, local upscale 

5




steakhouses and polished casual chains, such as The Cheesecake Factory, Bonefish and BJ’s. There is also competition from other Vibe Dining restaurants such as Nobu, Lavo and Tao and other high-end hospitality services companies such as the Gerber Group, Lettuce Entertain You and ESquared Hospitality. To the extent that we operate lounges and similar venues in hotels and resorts, we are subject to our host venues being able to compete effectively in attracting customers who would frequent our establishments.
Seasonality
Our business is subject to fluctuations due to seasonality and adverse weather. Because of the seasonality of the business and the industry, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any other quarter or the full calendar year. Typically, our fourth quarter has higher sales volumes than other quarters in the year.
Intellectual Property
Our rights in our registered and unregistered intellectual property, including trademarks and service marks, are significant to our business. We own the U.S. federal registration rights to “STK,” “Kona Grill,” and several related word marks and design marks related to our brands. We depend on registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks to maintain the identity of our locations. We license the rights to use certain trademarks we own or license to our licensees in connection with their operations. We also own several other trademarks and service marks. It is our policy to defend our marks against encroachment by others.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 51 employees within our support center, 32 employees in multi-unit leadership and an aggregate of 262 full-time, salaried employees at our venues. We rely on hourly-wage employees for kitchen staff, servers, bussers, runners, polishers, hosts, bartenders, barbacks, reservationists, administrative support, and interns. The average headcount for employees in our domestic restaurants is 90. Combining full-time and part-time employees, we employ and manage directly approximately 3,700 persons and through ONE Hospitality we manage approximately 500 employees worldwide. We have never experienced a work stoppage, and none of our employees are represented by a labor organization.
Our human capital objectives include attracting, developing, rewarding, and retaining our existing and new employees. We offer our employees online training courses and on-the-job training. Restaurant management trainees undergo training in order to understand all aspects of our restaurant operations. We provide our employees with cash-based performance bonuses. We also have an equity incentive compensation plan to provide certain management-level or other key employees with stock-based awards. We have implemented programs to attract and retain both restaurant managers and hourly employees. We monitor our progress with metrics such as employee performance measures, turnover rates and restaurant customer surveys.
​
Government Regulation
​
Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental regulation, including health, safety, labor, sanitation, building and fire agencies in the state, county, municipality or jurisdiction in which the restaurant is located. In certain states, our restaurants are subject to “dram shop” statutes, which generally provides a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. We maintain the necessary restaurant, alcoholic beverage and retail licenses, permits and approvals. Federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our employees and affect operating costs. The development and construction of new restaurants are also subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. A failure to comply with one or more regulations could result in the imposition of sanctions, including the closing of restaurants for an indeterminate period of time, fines or third-party litigation.

We are required to file reports with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov.
