 Item 1. Business.
 Overview
 We are the largest and fastest-growing franchisor and operator of out-of-home ("OOH") waxing services in the United States by number of centers and system-wide sales. We delivered over 13 million waxing services in 2020, over 20 million waxing services in 2021 and over 22 million waxing services in 2022 generating $469 million, $797 million and $899 million of system-wide sales, respectively, across our highly-franchised network. We have a leading portfolio of centers operating in 944 locations across 45 states as of December 31, 2022. Of these locations, 938 are franchised centers operated by franchisees and six are corporate-owned centers.
 The European Wax Center brand is trusted, efficacious and accessible. Our culture is obsessed with our guest experience and we deliver a superior guest experience relative to smaller chains and independent salons. We offer guests high-quality, hygienic waxing services administered by our licensed, EWC-trained estheticians (our “wax specialists”), at our accessible and welcoming locations (our “centers”). Our technology-enabled guest interface simplifies and streamlines the guest experience with automated appointment scheduling and remote check-in capabilities, ensuring guest visits are convenient, hassle-free, and consistent across our network of centers. Our well-known, pre-paid Wax Pass program makes payment easy and convenient, fostering loyalty and return visits. Guests view us as a non-discretionary part of their personal-care and beauty regimens, providing us with a highly predictable and growing recurring revenue model.
 Our asset-light franchise platform delivers capital-efficient growth, significant cash flow generation, and resilience through economic cycles. Our centers are 99% owned and operated by our franchisees who benefit from superior unit-level economics, with mature centers generating annual cash-on-cash returns in excess of 60%.
In partnership with our franchisees, we fiercely protect our points of differentiation that attract new guests, build meaningful relationships and promote lasting retention. We are so confident in our ability to delight that we have always offered all of our guests their first wax free.
 Our Recent Financial Performance
 Performance in 2020 and During the COVID-19 Pandemic
 In January and February 2020, our performance continued with the same momentum experienced in 2019, with same-store sales growth of 11.1% and 10.8%, compared to the prior year periods. At the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, however, all of our centers temporarily closed due to the implementation of certain mandated closure requirements across the United States. In response to the pandemic, our management team developed and executed a detailed response plan focused on raising our already industry-leading hygiene standards and ensuring the safety of our guests, franchisees and associates.
 By May 2020, our centers began to re-open as local health and safety guidance allowed and we saw an immediate rebound in performance. While the trajectory of our same-store sales performance fluctuated during the second half of 2020 in conjunction with state-specific loosening or tightening of COVID-19 restrictions in response to subsequent waves of COVID-19, our overall recovery demonstrates our guests consistently wanted to get back to their regular waxing routines at European Wax Center. By March 2021, nearly all of our nationwide network had re-opened and we were generating system-wide sales of approximately 101% of what they had been in March 2019 suggesting a nearly complete rebound from COVID-19 impacted performance in 2020. 87% of the 52 opened centers came from our existing franchise base, reinforcing our network’s belief in the stability and future success of our brand. During 2020, despite the challenges from COVID-19, our platform delivered strong growth in new centers as well as resilience in revenues and profit margins. All corporate-owned centers had re-opened as of December 26, 2020.
 •Center count increased from 750 in 2019 to 796 in 2020;
 •System-wide sales decreased from $687 million in 2019 to $469 million in 2020;
 •Net revenue decreased from $154 million in 2019 to $103 million in 2020;
 •Net loss decreased from $24 million in 2019 to $21 million in 2020; and
 •Adjusted EBITDA decreased from $34 million in 2019 to $20 million in 2020.
 Performance during 2021
 As conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic continued to improve, our platform delivered growth in revenue and profitability, as well as an increase in new centers during fiscal year 2021. As of December 25, 2021 all of our centers had reopened, and we expect that our future financial results will continue to strengthen as COVID-19 related capacity restrictions were lifted and guests are able to return to our centers at full capacity levels.
 •Center count increased from 796 as of December 26, 2020 to 853 as of December 25, 2021;


•System-wide sales increased from $469 million in fiscal year 2020 to $797 million in fiscal year 2021;
 •The Company’s total revenue increased from $103 million for the year ended December 26, 2020 to $179 million for the year ended December 25, 2021;
 •Consolidated net income improved from a net loss of $21 million in 2020 to net income of $4.0 million in 2021; and
 •Adjusted EBITDA increased from $20 million for the year ended December 26, 2020 to $64 million for the year ended December 25, 2021.
 Performance during 2022
 In fiscal year 2022, our platform once again delivered growth in revenue, profitability and new centers, which underscores the consistency of our business model and our high engagement with our guests and franchise partners. Highlights from fiscal year 2022 include:
 •Center count increased from 853 as of December 25, 2021 to 944 as of December 31, 2022;
 •System-wide sales increased from $797 million in fiscal year 2021 to $899 million in fiscal year 2022;
 •The Company’s total revenue increased from $179 million for the year ended December 25, 2021 to $207 million for the year ended December 31, 2022;
 •Consolidated net income improved from $4.0 million in 2021 to net income of $13.6 million in 2022; and
 •Adjusted EBITDA increased from $64 million for the year ended December 25, 2021 to $72 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
 Our Growing Market Opportunity
 Hair removal is an integral and recurring part of the personal-care and beauty regimens for most women and many men in the United States, and hair removal solutions are consistently in demand, given the recurring nature of hair growth.
We estimate that our $18 billion total addressable domestic market includes approximately 69 million U.S. adults who are currently waxing or are interested in waxing. The OOH waxing market, in which European Wax Center competes, is the fastest growing hair removal alternative and grew at an estimated compound annual growth rate ("CAGR") of 8% between 2015 and 2019, compared to an estimated CAGR of 3% over the same time period for the total hair removal market.
Although European Wax Center currently represents only 5% of our addressable market, we estimate we are approximately six times larger than our closest waxing-focused competitor within OOH waxing by center count and approximately 11 times larger by system-wide sales. Our market remains highly fragmented, with more than 10,000 independent waxing-focused operators that lack scale and almost 100,000 beauty salons that only provide waxing as a small part of their broader service offering. For many beauty salons and other similar operators, waxing is not their core competency, with services frequently provided in “backrooms” and without significant investment in the overall experience. This fragmentation results in a marketplace characterized by inconsistent quality, lack of technological accessibility and scheduling, and one-time transactional services that fail to instill customer trust and engagement. European Wax Center’s singular focus on waxing services and unmatched scale allow us to capitalize on this opportunity.
Our Differentiated Brand Experience
 We believe our approach to OOH waxing has revolutionized the category. Our brand experience is differentiated because we are:
 •Experts in Wax: Our service model is focused exclusively on wax-based hair removal. We obsess over every element of the waxing services we deliver for our guests:
 •Expert Line-up of Waxing Services & Products: We provide a comprehensive assortment of body and facial waxing services using our Comfort Wax formulation, which features a unique blend of the highest quality natural beeswax combined with other skin-soothing ingredients for the most comfortable waxing experience. We provide a line of proprietary pre- and post-service products, including ingrown hair serums, exfoliating gels, brow shapers and skin treatments, which ensure the full benefits of the waxing experience are realized by our guests.
 •Expert Training of our Licensed Wax Specialists: Our franchisees employ over 8,000 licensed, highly-trained and knowledgeable wax specialists committed to delivering an exceptional guest experience. In addition to being licensed, every EWC wax specialist must successfully complete our proprietary training program to ensure consistency and quality of service for every guest. Our wax-focused education modules provide time-intensive training that substantially builds upon cosmetology licensing programs. We view our training as a key competitive differentiator enabling guests to receive a consistent service delivery regardless of the wax specialist with whom they are scheduled. Through the delivery of personalized services and education about the benefits of regular waxing, our wax specialists help strengthen guest loyalty to our brand.


•Expert Hygiene and Safety Standards: We adhere to the highest safety and hygiene standards in the industry. We from time to time engage third-party safety experts to review and enhance our hygiene protocols. Wax Specialists utilize disposable gloves and masks to administer services and we strictly adhere to single use wax applicator protocols (we never double dip the applicator blades in wax pots). Our wax suites are sanitized and disinfected after each guest visit. In addition, our centers are equipped with socially-distanced seating arrangements and multiple sanitary stations, and our mobile app facilitates a contactless experience with self-check-in.
 •Champions of Confidence and Guest Experience: According to consumer surveys, our guests feel better and more confident after a service visit at one of our centers. We have focused on enhancing the guest experience across all touchpoints within our brand:
 •Champions of Accessibility: Our growing network of 944 centers across 45 states enables convenience and accessibility for our customers. Whether our guests move across town or across the country, our brand can serve their ongoing waxing needs with more access points than any other provider of OOH waxing services in the United States. Our Wax Pass program is portable across our network and guests often redeem services through a Wax Pass across multiple European Wax Center locations. Our mobile app technology further enhances accessibility by enabling guests to easily book appointments on-line at a time and location most convenient to them.
 •Champions of the In-Center Experience: Our in-center atmosphere is designed to be refined, clean and easy to use, with mobile app self-check-in available at all centers. Our lobby features an inviting product wall with take-home sampling. Our guests can choose to wait for their appointment in their car until a text alerts them to walk directly to their designated suite where their wax specialist awaits. Our iPad-equipped suites provide our wax specialists with detailed insights on each of their guests, empowering them to personalize product recommendations, for example.
 •Champions of Guest Retention and Repeat Visits: We encourage guests to schedule future visits on a regular basis and reward them for their use of our pre-paid Wax Pass program. We believe Wax Pass holders visit us more frequently, have meaningfully higher retention rates and represent our most valuable guests. Additionally, we expect to further amplify our guest experience and drive retention with our EWC Rewards Loyalty Program that launched in October 2021.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 We attribute our success to the following strengths that we believe provide us with a competitive advantage in our industry:
 Trusted National Brand that Inspires Confidence
 We believe revealing beautiful skin is the first step to revealing one’s best self, and our brand stands for delivering unapologetic confidence to our guests. Waxing is an intimate experience, and our guests seek a dependable, safe, and clean setting with a professional wax specialist they trust. Our unmatched scale provides us with a nationwide footprint to serve our loyal guest base wherever they may be. Our singular commitment to delivering best-in-class service is reinforced by our marketing efforts driving national brand awareness and consideration. We are so confident in our ability to delight that we have always offered all our guests their first wax free.
Committed Franchisees Achieving Attractive and Predictable Unit-Level Economics
 Our simple, yet difficult to replicate, operating model translates into an attractive return on our franchisees’ invested capital. Our high-quality franchisee base consists of 217 franchisees as of December 31, 2022, with 143 franchisees operating multiple European Wax Center locations. Our current franchisees represent over 94% of new center openings over the last three years, demonstrating their continued interest to grow our brand based on four-wall economics and return on investment. Our centers require a modest upfront investment cost, then achieve profitability and generate superior unit-level economics. We generate revenue from our franchisees through the sale of branded products as well as the payment of ongoing fees, including royalty and marketing fund contributions, which are determined by the service sales of each center. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we received revenue from our franchisees as follows: $117.7 million, or 58%, of our revenue came from product sales, $49.7 million, or 25%, of our revenue through franchisee royalty payments, $28.0 million, or 14%, of our revenue through marketing fund contributions, and $5.4 million, or 3%, of our revenue came from other sources. Our remaining revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 was generated from corporate-owned centers.
 Our centers experience a highly predictable maturation curve that is consistent across cohorts and geographies, providing our franchisees with a high degree of confidence in realizing attractive returns. We believe our value proposition has created a franchisee base that is committed to growing with our brand, with more than 87% of new centers opened in 2020, 93% of new centers opened in 2021 and 99% of new centers opened in 2022 coming from existing franchisees.
Recurring Nature of Services Combined with Scaled Footprint and Consistent Demand Drives Revenue Predictability
 Hair removal is an integral part of the personal-care and beauty regimens for most women and many men in the United States. Given the recurring nature of hair growth, hair removal solutions are regularly in demand and our guests trust European Wax Center to meet their routine hair removal needs. Our national scale and exclusive focus on wax-based hair removal enables us to provide a highly consistent waxing experience across each of our centers. The reliability of our guest experience ensures consistent demand for our services, which drives uniform unit-level economics for our franchisees which in turn drives revenue predictability for European Wax Center. We further facilitate repeat visits through the use of our pre-paid Wax Pass program, which we believe promotes meaningfully higher guest retention rates.
Asset-Light Franchise Platform with Resilient Free Cash Flow Generation
 Our asset-light franchise platform delivers capital-efficient growth, significant cash flow, and resilience through economic cycles. Due to the impacts of COVID-19, including the temporary closure of all of our centers, our network experienced the first year of negative same-store sales growth in 2020. However, positive same-store sales growth, calculated against both 2020 and 2019, resumed in 2021. In addition, given our low capital expenditures and working capital needs, we are able to drive strong free cash flow generation throughout economic cycles. In 2020, for example, through disciplined cost management, our business remained profitable on an EBITDA basis and sustained strong EBITDA margins despite the decline in system- wide sales driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our ability to drive robust financial performance through 2020 is a testament to the resilience of our platform, which enables us to invest in technology and digital enablement, training programs, and marketing initiatives. This is a key differentiator of our scaled platform relative to independent operators in our market, and a significant reason why we believe we are the franchisor of choice in OOH waxing.
Experienced and Passionate Management Team Investing in the Next Phase of Our Growth
 We are led by a best-in-class management team and our culture of performance, success and inclusivity is established by our CEO David Berg, who previously served as the CEO of Carlson Hospitality and has extensive retail, hospitality and franchising experience. Since joining us in 2018, Mr. Berg has led the acceleration of our center growth, the expansion of our franchisee network and our heightened cultural obsession with guest satisfaction.
 The other members of our leadership team have been assembled at European Wax Center from senior positions at leading retail and franchising organizations including Bloomin' Brands, Jamba Juice, and American Eagle Outfitters. Our team has encouraged investment in tech-forward systems and corporate infrastructure to support the anticipated continued growth of our network. We believe our guests and franchisees are better connected with one another as a result of our scale advantages and we are only in the early innings of truly unlocking the potential of our unique platform.
 Our Growth Strategies
 We intend to deliver sustainable growth in revenue and profitability by executing on the following basic strategies:
 Grow Our National Footprint Across New and Existing Markets
 We believe our franchisees’ track record of successfully opening new centers and consistently generating attractive unit-level economics validates our strategy to expand our footprint and grow our capacity to serve more guests. Our center count grew 11%, 7% and 6% during fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and has grown every year since 2010. Our thoughtful approach to growth ensures each center is appropriately staffed with the high-quality team and licensed, highly trained wax specialists that our brand has been known for since our initial opening.
 We believe that none of our existing markets are fully penetrated and approximately 75% of our whitespace opportunity is in markets where we already have a presence today, which provides us with a high degree of confidence for the likely receptivity and success of new openings.
Our new centers require a modest upfront investment and follow a highly predictable maturation curve across cohorts and geographies, providing us and our franchisees with a high degree of visibility into the embedded earnings potential of newly opened centers. Historically, our centers reach maturity after five years, and as of December 31, 2022, 63% of our centers were mature.
Continue to Grow Our Brand Awareness and Accelerate Our Guest Acquisition
 We believe that influential consumer trends will continue to expand the market for OOH waxing and that the OOH market will continue to take share from alternative hair removal solutions. Although our brand is nationally recognized, there are still significant opportunities to further drive brand awareness to attract new guests while increasing engagement of existing guests through increased visit frequency and spend.
To drive brand awareness with all consumers, we employ several strategies, including:
 •Performance marketing: We deploy data-driven marketing dollars across multiple forms of media with an attractive return on advertising spend;


•Digital content: We partner with select digital media content creators and social media influencers, thereby encouraging positive testimonials from our guests; and
 •Market densification: We are strategically densifying existing target markets with new centers thus increasing regional brand awareness and word-of-mouth referrals.
 Employ Strategies to Continue Driving System-Wide Sales Growth
 We are continuously employing strategies to increase guest visit frequency and drive higher guest spend with the aim of sustaining our system-wide sales growth, including:
 •Increase Wax Pass Adoption Rates: Our Wax Pass program provides guests with preferential pricing through either pre-paid or unlimited wax passes and provides us with a recurring and predictable revenue stream. We continue to expand and refine the program to drive increased adoption from non- member guests and we have grown the share of transactions conducted using Wax Passes to approximately 59% in 2022.
 •Expand our Share of our Guests’ Personal-Care Expenditures: The trusted relationships between guests and wax specialists results in an authentic channel through which we can increase our share of our guests’ spend on personal-care. Over time, we believe the relationship between guest and wax specialist provides us a strong foundation to broaden our offerings across the personal-care category.
 •Increase our Transaction Attachment Rate: Approximately 13%, 14% and 15% of transactions in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, resulted in purchases of retail products. In April 2021, we launched a refreshed portfolio of retail products complementing our core waxing services across all centers. We expect to drive greater attachment rates from this new product line-up through the right product innovation, attractive pricing, and expert consultative selling by our trained wax specialists. We define the term “attachment rate” as the percentage of transactions that include the purchase of a retail product to the total number of transactions. 
 •Drive Greater Guest Engagement Using Data Analytics: We are continuously developing new use cases from our guest database. As our data capabilities mature, we believe we will learn more about our guests’ preferences and behaviors, unlocking more high-quality interaction opportunities. We are in the process of expanding our advanced data analysis capabilities to improve guest visit frequency and loyalty by deploying timely and hyper-personalized communications and relevant reminders to our guests.
Expand Our Profit Margins and Generate Robust Free Cash Flow
 We have invested in building our scalable support infrastructure, and we currently have the capabilities and systems in place to drive revenue growth and profitability across our existing and planned franchise centers. Given our unmatched scale within the OOH waxing market, we can procure the highest quality products and supplies used to administer our services at lower prices than smaller independent providers of the same services. We expect to generate operating leverage given our fixed corporate cost structure, and we expect that incremental leverage, combined with our low capital expenditure and working capital needs, will allow us to generate improved operating margins and robust free cash flow.
Our Guests
 Approximately 96% of our guests are women, with our brand appealing to female guests across age groups, ethnicities and income brackets. At every touchpoint, we embody our mission by concentrating key media communications on passion points that bolster guest affinity for European Wax Center and deliver personalized messaging to inspire action. We believe that there has been a significant increase in male interest in OOH waxing which represents an attractive growth opportunity. We intend to increase our share of male guests, with specific male-focused marketing collateral and service offerings.
Our Centers
 We have a leading portfolio of centers operating in 944 locations across 45 states as of December 31, 2022. Of these locations, 938 are franchised centers operated by franchisees and six are corporate-owned centers.
 On average, our centers are approximately 1,200 to 1,600 square feet with six to seven wax suites and are typically staffed with one wax specialist per suite in addition to one or two guest service associates. Our centers are designed to provide a seamless guest experience from the moment our guests walk in, to the moment they strut out of our centers. Upon entry, guests are greeted by a friendly service associate in a clean and modern lobby. The lobby offers refined colors and textures that align with the European Wax Center brand ethos. Our guests can self-check-in through our mobile app, which increases the swiftness of guest intake while allowing our team members to focus on servicing guests.
 Our centers are committed to industry-leading hygiene and safety standards. Once checked-in, our guests enter a private, sanitized waxing suite where wax specialists offer a personalized experience. In-suite iPads provide our wax specialists with detailed insights on each of their guests, empowering them to provide “concierge-like” services such as personalized add-on services and product

recommendations, driving increased guest spend. After each service, our guests are encouraged to test our retail products with samples from our touch-free sample bar, promoting our transaction attachment rate.
 We continuously evaluate and enhance our center layout, imagery and cost build-out to ensure we have the best experience for our guests which drives continued robust financial performance for our franchisees.
 Center Selection Criteria
 We have a scaled and diverse footprint with ample whitespace for center growth in new markets, as well as densification within our existing markets. Site selection for new centers are typically proposed by our franchisees and reviewed and approved by European Wax Center as the franchisor. We determine whether a site is appropriate for a European Wax Center location based on the condition of the premises, ease of access, visibility, proximity to other centers, proximity to other competitive businesses, lease requirements, co-tenants, traffic patterns, demographics and population density, among other factors.
Our Services and Retail Products
 We offer our guests a variety of elevated body and facial waxing services focused on the most critical areas of their bodies needing hair removal. We also offer skincare retail products to ensure that the full benefits of the waxing experience are realized by our guests.
Services
 Our waxing services are administered by licensed wax specialists who are employed by our franchisees. In addition, prior to performing our services, our wax specialists go through a rigorous, proprietary EWC training regime. Continuous training education is also a part of our ongoing operating plan to ensure the highest quality service can constantly be delivered across our network of centers. Our wax specialists utilize our Comfort Wax formulation during the waxing service. This wax product features a blend of the highest quality natural beeswax combined with other skin-soothing ingredients and is co-manufactured for us by suppliers in Europe. Unlike other wax formulations, our wax is designed to specifically attach only to hair, not skin, providing a differentiated and more comfortable waxing experience.
Retail Products
 Our centers sell a comprehensive assortment of proprietary EWC-branded retail products that allow guests to maintain healthy post-wax skin between visits. These products are specifically tailored to enhance the services we provide. Our products are dermatologist-tested and are formulated without parabens, mineral oil, phthalates, hydroquinone, triclosan, formaldehyde and gluten. We exclusively distribute these retail products to our franchisees for sale in-center and sell them direct-to-consumer through our website. We have approximately 35 full-sized SKUs in our branded product portfolio.
 We partner with a leading co-manufacturer in North America to coordinate the manufacturing of our retail product offerings. While our suppliers support us in formulation, sourcing, manufacturing, package development, safety testing and quality assurance, we own all of our retail product formulas and lead the new product development processes to align our innovation capabilities with our strategic priorities.
Marketing Support
 Based on our deep guest understanding and longevity in the OOH waxing market, we believe we have developed a highly effective marketing strategy that is designed to promote awareness and consideration of our brand by new guests and encourage retention by existing guests.
 We employ a variety of marketing techniques to build awareness of, and create demand for, our brand, and the services and products we offer. We have implemented sophisticated data-driven marketing practices in support of this framework and we deploy the dedicated marketing funds contributed by our franchisees across each of our marketing strategies. Due to center closures in 2020 driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, we paused our marketing fund collections from April 2020 to June 2020. As a result, we do not believe that the amounts collected and spent through our centralized marketing fund in 2020 are representative of our historical or expected future marketing collections and spend. In 2021, we collected and spent approximately $25 million for marketing through our centralized marketing fund, of which 44% was deployed through digital channels. In 2022, we collected and spent approximately $28 million for marketing through our centralized marketing fund, of which 57% was deployed through digital channels.
 In addition to our corporate marketing strategy, many of franchisees choose to make additional investments in local marketing. We provide support to ensure that their marketing aligns with our overall image and strategy.
 Our Franchise Platform
 Franchising Strategy
 Our asset-light franchise platform delivers capital-efficient growth and our footprint expansion is supported by robust unit-level economics. Our simple, yet difficult to replicate, operating model and the recurring nature of our services translates into an attractive return on invested capital for our franchisees. Our centers require a modest upfront investment cost and follow a highly predictable maturation curve that is consistent across cohorts and geographies.


We are intentionally shifting toward a larger mix of multi-unit development agreements as we grow our footprint, which will allow for consistent and efficient growth as we continue to scale.
 Franchise Agreements
 For each of our franchisees, we enter into a franchise agreement stipulating a standard set of terms and conditions. The initial term of a franchise agreement is generally ten years, with the option to renew their agreements at expiration (ten-year renewal option). All proposed new center sites require formal approval from us. Franchisees pay us an initial franchise license fee and franchise royalties typically based on a percentage of gross sales less the sale of retail products. Franchisees also make contributions to our centralized marketing fund based on a percentage of gross sales less the sale of retail products.
 Our franchise agreements set forth the requirements franchisees must comply with, including, but not limited to, our standard operational policies and procedures that govern the provision of services and use of suppliers and require franchisees to purchase specified products from us and/or designated suppliers. Franchisees are required to conform to our established operational policies and procedures relating to, among other things, quality of service, training, center design and décor and trademark usage. Outside of these operational policies and procedures, we do not control the day-to-day operations of franchised centers, including, but not limited to, employment, benefits and wage determination, establishing prices to charge for products and services, business hours, personnel management and capital expenditure decisions. However, the franchise agreements afford us, as franchisor, certain rights, including, but not limited to, the right to approve locations, suppliers and the sale of a franchise. Additionally, our field personnel make periodic visits to franchised centers to ensure that they are operating in conformity with the operational policies and procedures for our franchising program. All of the rights afforded to us with regard to franchised operations allow us to protect our brand, but do not allow us to control the day-to-day operations of franchised centers or make decisions that have a significant impact on the success of franchised centers.
 Franchise Support Services
 We enjoy a strong partnership with our franchisees. To support their collective and individual success, we provide our franchisees with meaningful support services including pre-opening support, guest experience support, and ongoing back-end support.
 Pre-opening support:
 •Site selection and approval: we work in partnership with our franchisees to ensure prospective new center locations are adequately vetted ahead of any initial investment. Each franchisee is responsible for selecting a location but must ultimately obtain approval from us.
 •Other pre-opening support: we conduct business reviews with each franchisee prior to new center openings to ensure construction activities are in sync with recruitment plans, training programs and all other pre-opening marketing activities to ensure each center is best positioned to open successfully and build momentum. 
 Guest experience support:
 •Wax training: we require an intensive six-day training program for all new wax specialists as well as continued learning requirements to keep all wax specialists performing at the consistent, high-quality standards for which we are known. Training is conducted by a corporate or peer trainer both in-person as well as virtually. Franchisees also appoint in-house trainers who are expected to maintain an ongoing training system for wax specialists and other associates within each center.
 •Hygiene protocols: our health and safety standards were industry-leading even before the COVID-19 pandemic and continue to be industry-leading. We engage with independent safety experts to ensure our continued leadership and to ensure our centers remain best-in-class from a hygiene standard.
 Ongoing support:
 •Marketing and consumer insights: our centralized marketing strategy, funded by contributions from our franchisees based on a percentage of gross sales, net of retail product sales, as defined in the franchise agreement, allows us to leverage our scale in media buying and utilize our proprietary guest insights to maximize brand awareness and consideration.
 •Uniform Point-of-Sales System: we leverage a consistent Point-of-Sales system, which includes a guest-facing application, across our entire network which is easy to adopt and results in a streamlined approach to ongoing technical support for our franchisees.
 •Procurement and supply chain: our operating leverage and our scale allows us to procure the highest quality products at lower prices than smaller independent waxing-focused operators benefiting our franchisees.
 •Performance management: our team of Franchise Business Consultants works closely with our franchisees across regional territories with ongoing managerial support including: monthly business reviews, per-center brand health and voice-of-customer measurement and additional one-on-one support as needed.


These support services allow our franchisees to focus on the day-to-day operations of their centers and to provide high-quality services that our guests have come to associate with our brand. We also participate in a Franchise Advisory council, through which we collect continuous feedback from our franchisees to enhance our offering, business model and support services, and to ensure that our franchisees have an open channel of communication with us.
Franchise Unit-Level Economics
 A European Wax Center location typically reaches maturity in year five of operations, at which point a center generates on average $1.1 million in revenue and annual cash-on-cash returns in excess of 60%. A typical franchisee initially invests approximately $392,000 when opening a new center (excluding real estate purchase or lease costs, pre-opening expenses and initial working capital investment), with ongoing fees that are determined by the service sales of each center. These ongoing fees include royalty and marketing fund contributions, which are 6% and 3% of service sales, respectively. Our centers follow a highly predictable maturation curve once open that is consistent across cohorts and geographies, with an average unit volume of $0.8 million and double-digit EBITDA margins already in year two of operations.
Competition
 The OOH waxing industry is highly fragmented with more than 10,000 independent waxing operators and almost 100,000 beauty salons that provide waxing as a small part of their broader service offerings. Within OOH waxing, we compete with independent waxing operators, beauty salons, beauty parlors, health clubs, spas, beauty supply stores and other independently owned companies. We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of our services, the trustworthiness of our brand, our best-in-class hygiene standards, convenience, accessibility, guest experience and the depth of our experience as experts within OOH waxing.
 We also compete with other types of hair removal alternatives, including laser hair removal, sugaring, threading, as well as in-home solutions, such as shaving, chemical-based creams, epilators, at-home laser hair removal and at-home waxing. OOH laser hair removal is a semi-permanent solution that is significantly more expensive than OOH waxing. Sugaring and threading are both less effective options than OOH waxing and have not been widely adopted among consumers. At-home shaving lasts for a significantly shorter time than waxing, and other at-home solutions are frequently viewed as less effective, messier, more painful and more time-consuming than OOH services administered by highly-trained specialists.
 We also compete with other franchisors on the basis of the expected return on investment for franchisees and the value proposition that we offer them. We compete to sell franchises to potential franchisees who may choose to purchase franchises from other service providers in other markets.
 Suppliers and Distributors
 To preserve brand integrity and consistency, we require our franchisees to purchase products related to the operation of their franchised centers, including our wax and branded skin care products, either from us, our affiliates or approved suppliers. We maintain strong, longstanding relationships with our suppliers to ensure market competitiveness and reliability in our supply chain. We leverage our sizeable spend to obtain favorable terms from our suppliers and to provide competitive prices to our franchisees, thus improving profitability and providing a considerable advantage over competitors that lack our scale. We believe that as our business continues to grow, our scale will continue to drive increased procurement benefits across our business.
 Our products are manufactured by market leaders, and we partner with two overseas suppliers with multiple facilities in Spain and France to source our wax and one supplier to source our branded retail products. We currently have a long-term contract with only one of our wax suppliers. Our manufacturing partners arrange for delivery of products either to one of the three third-party distribution centers that supply our centers or directly to our franchised and corporate-owned centers. In addition, we partner with one supplier to provide medical products to our centers for use in administering wax services.
We typically keep three to six months of wax inventory at three third party distribution centers to sustain system-wide supply and protect against shortfalls that could arise from unforeseen market unavailability. These three distribution centers are located in Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Nevada to provide optimal distribution capability for us to meet the demands from centers throughout the United States. We believe that the existing supply chain we have in place is sufficient to support our future growth.
Information & Technology Systems
 We utilize our information technology infrastructure to facilitate data-driven management decisions. Across our franchise system, we use a fully integrated platform that helps franchisees with reporting, marketing, operations, guest service and center management. Our technology platform gives management access to key reporting metrics across our network, providing comprehensive insight into system health.
Governmental Regulation
 Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and municipal laws and regulations in the United States in areas such as consumer protection, occupational licensing, environmental protection, data privacy, labor and employment, tax, permitting, and other laws and regulations. In certain jurisdictions, we must obtain licenses or permits in order to comply with standards governing employee selection, training and business conduct.
 We, as a franchisor, are subject to various federal and state laws, and the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) regulates our franchising activities in the United States. The FTC requires that franchisors make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees before the execution of a franchise agreement. Fourteen states require registration and, together with at least one other state, require specific disclosure in connection with franchise offers and sales, and at least twenty states and U.S. territories have “franchise relationship laws” that limit the ability of franchisors to terminate franchise agreements or withhold consent to the renewal or transfer of these agreements.
 We are not aware of any federal, state, local, municipal or other laws or regulations that are likely to materially alter or impact our revenues, cash flow or competitive positions, or result in any material capital expenditures. However, we cannot predict the effect on our operations, particularly on our relationship with franchisees, of any pending or future legislation or regulations or the future interpretation of any existing laws, including any newly enacted laws, that may impact us or our franchisees.
 Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 117 full-time employees, including approximately five full-time employees at corporate-owned centers. We also employ approximately 84 part-time associates, primarily in our corporate-owned centers. None of these employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and prospective employees. The principal purposes of our incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, executive officers and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards. We strive for exceptional performance and results, which is why meritocracy is one of our core values. We provide employees the opportunity to grow and to be rewarded based on results.
 To ensure the health and safety of our and our franchisees’ employees we have refined our in-center atmosphere to allow for contactless check-in and elevated our hygiene standards at all centers. We sanitize all wax suites with disinfectant wipes after each guest’s visit and require our franchisees to carry an inventory of gloves, face masks and other personal protective equipment.
 Our franchises are independently owned and operated businesses. As such, employees of our franchisees are not employees of European Wax Center, Inc. or EWC Ventures.
 Intellectual Property
 Our trademarks are important to our marketing efforts and conduct of business. We own or have the rights to use certain trademarks, service marks and trade names that are registered or for which registration applications are pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or exist under common law in the United States. Trademarks that are important in identifying and distinguishing our products and services include, but are not limited to EUROPEAN WAX CENTER®, EWC®, STRUT 365®, WAX PASS® and COMFORT WAX®. We also own domain names, including our primary domain “www.waxcenter.com.”
Seasonality
 Seasonal changes may moderately impact the demand for our waxing services. For example, our guests may come to our centers more frequently in the summer months and during the November to December holiday season.
