ITEM 1. BUSINESS
SUMMARY OF RISK FACTORS
The following is a summary of the principal risk factors associated with an investment in us:
•Global economic, political and market conditions may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability;
•Events beyond our control, including public health crises, could adversely impact our portfolio companies and our results of our operations;
•The capital markets are currently in a period of disruption and economic uncertainty. Such market conditions have adversely affected debt and equity capital markets, which have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our business and operations;
•Future disruptions or instability in capital markets could negatively impact our ability to raise capital, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations;
•The discontinuation of London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and the transition to any new reference rates may affect the value of our LIBOR-indexed portfolio investments and may increase the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities, which in each case could affect our results of operations or financial condition;
•The amount of any distributions we pay is uncertain. Our distributions to our stockholders may exceed our earnings. Therefore, portions of the distributions that we pay may represent a return of capital to you which will lower your tax basis in your shares and reduce the amount of funds we have for investment in targeted assets. We may not be able to pay you distributions, and our distributions may not grow over time;
•Price declines in the large corporate leveraged loan market may adversely affect the fair value of debt securities we hold, reducing our net asset value (“NAV”) through increased net unrealized depreciation;
•Our ability to achieve our investment objective depends on our Adviser’s (as defined below) and its affiliates’ ability to manage and support our investment process. If our Adviser were to lose any members of its senior management team, our ability to achieve our investment objective could be significantly harmed;
•Because our business model depends to a significant extent upon relationships with investment banks, business brokers, loan syndication and trading desks, and commercial banks, the inability of our Adviser to maintain or develop these relationships, or the failure of these relationships to generate investment opportunities, could adversely affect our business;
•A significant portion of our investment portfolio is recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors (the “Board of Directors”) and, as a result, there is and will be uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments;
•Our Board of Directors may change our operating policies and strategies without prior notice or stockholder approval, the effects of which may be adverse;
•We are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility;
•Efforts to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will involve significant expenditures, and non-compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may adversely affect us;
•Terrorist attacks, acts of war, natural disasters, disease outbreaks or pandemics may impact our portfolio companies and harm our business, operating results and financial condition;
•We are highly dependent on information systems and systems failures or interruption could significantly disrupt our business, which may, in turn, negatively affect the market price of our common stock (the “Common Stock”) and our ability to pay dividends and other distributions;
•Our business could suffer in the event our Adviser or any other party that provides us with services essential to our operations experiences system failures or cyber-incidents or a deficiency in cybersecurity;
•To the extent that our Adviser serves as a “joint bookrunner” in connection with the underwriting of a loan or other security to be acquired, it may be subject to underwriter liability under the federal securities laws. This liability can be managed principally through the exercise of due diligence regarding any such offering. In addition, if it acts as joint bookrunner for a loan or other securities offering and is not successful in syndicating the loan or offering, our Adviser may acquire a larger amount of the subject securities than it had planned, and it may be required to hold such loan or security for a longer period than it had anticipated;
•We could potentially be involved in litigation arising out of our operations in the normal course of business;
•The time and resources that individuals and the executive officers of our Adviser devote to us may be diverted, and we may face additional competition due to the fact that neither our Adviser, nor its affiliates, is prohibited from raising money for or managing another entity that makes the same types of investments that we target;
•There are significant potential conflicts of interest that could impact our investment returns;
•Our fee structure may induce our Adviser to make speculative investments or incur debt;
•In selecting and structuring investments appropriate for us, our Adviser will consider our investment and tax objectives and those of our stockholders as a whole, not the investment, tax or other objectives of any stockholder individually;
•Our Adviser can resign on 60 days’ notice, and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement within that time, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our financial condition, business, and results of operations;
•Our failure to invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets could result in our failure to maintain our status as a business development company (“BDC”);
•Regulations governing our operation as a BDC and regulated investment company (“RIC”) will affect our ability to raise, and the way in which we raise, additional capital or borrow for investment purposes, which may have a negative effect on our growth;
•We are uncertain of our sources for funding our future capital needs; if we cannot obtain debt or equity financing on acceptable terms, our ability to acquire investments and to expand our operations will be adversely affected;
•Our investments in portfolio companies may be risky, and we could lose all or part of our investment;
•There may be circumstances where our debt investments could be subordinated to claims of other creditors or we could be subject to lender liability claims;
•Second priority liens on collateral securing our loans may be subject to control by senior creditors with first priority liens. If there is a default, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to repay in full both the first priority creditors and us;
•We generally will not control our portfolio companies;
•The effect of global climate change may impact the operations of our portfolio companies;
•The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business;
•Because we borrow money, the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested in us will be magnified and may increase the risk of investing in us;
•Your interest in us will be diluted if we issue additional shares, which could reduce the overall value of your investment;
•Our shares will not be listed on an exchange or quoted through a quotation system for the foreseeable future, if ever. Therefore, you will have limited liquidity and may not receive a full return of your invested capital if you sell your shares;
•We may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income; and
•You may have current tax liability on distributions you elect to reinvest in our Common Stock but would not receive cash from such distributions to pay such tax liability.
Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or operating results. For a more detailed discussion of the risks that you should consider prior to investing in our securities, see the section below entitled “Risk Factors.”
General
Franklin BSP Capital Corporation (including, for periods prior the Conversion (as defined below), Franklin BSP Capital L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company, “FBCC,” or the “Company,” which may also be referred to as “we,” “us,” or “our”) is an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC and have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and to qualify annually thereafter, as a RIC. We were formed as a Delaware limited liability company on January 29, 2020 with the name Franklin BSP Capital L.L.C. Effective September 23, 2020, we converted to a Delaware corporation pursuant to which Franklin BSP Capital Corporation succeeded to the business of Franklin BSP Capital L.L.C. (the “Conversion”).
We are managed by Franklin BSP Capital Adviser L.L.C. (the “Adviser”), an affiliate of Benefit Street Partners L.L.C. (“Benefit Street Partners” or “BSP”). Our Adviser is a Delaware limited liability company that is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”). Our Adviser oversees the management of our activities and is responsible for making investment decisions with respect to our portfolio.
On December 18, 2020, we initiated our initial closing (“Initial Closing”) of capital commitments (the “Capital Commitments”) to purchase shares of our Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, in a private placement in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) pursuant to subscription agreements (“Subscription Agreement”) with investors. Since our Initial Closing, we held additional closings and received additional Capital Commitments to purchase Common Stock. As of December 31, 2022, total Capital Commitments of Common Stock were approximately $586.2 million. 
On August 25, 2021, we filed the Certificate of Designation for the series A preferred stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”). On the same day, we entered into subscription agreements (collectively the “Preferred Subscription Agreements”) with investors, pursuant to which investors made new capital commitments (the “Preferred Capital Commitments”) to purchase shares of our Series A Preferred Stock. As of December 31, 2022, total Preferred Capital Commitments of Series A Preferred Stock were $77.5 million. 
Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in first and second lien senior secured loans, and to a lesser extent, mezzanine loans, unsecured loans and equity of predominantly private U.S. middle market companies. We define middle market companies as those with EBITDA of between $25 million and $100 million annually, although we may invest in larger or smaller companies. We also may purchase interests in loans or corporate bonds through secondary market transactions, which refers to acquisitions from secondary market participants rather than from the portfolio company directly. See “Item 1. Business — Regulation as a Business Development Company” for discussion of BDC regulation and other regulatory considerations.
Senior secured loans generally are senior debt instruments that rank ahead of subordinated debt and equity in priority of payments and are generally secured by liens on the operating assets of a borrower which may include inventory, receivables, plant, property and equipment. Mezzanine debt is subordinated to senior loans and is generally unsecured. Although we have no policy governing the maturities of our investments, under current market conditions we expect that we will invest in a portfolio of debt generally having maturities of between five to ten years. The loans are often held for five years or less before any refinancing or disposition. For a discussion of the risks inherent in our portfolio investments, please see the discussion under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
We may co-invest, subject to the conditions included in the exemptive order received by affiliates of our Adviser from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), with certain of our affiliates. See “Item 1. Business — “Potential Conflicts of Interests; Co-Investment Opportunities” and “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence” below. We believe that such co-investments afford us additional investment opportunities and an ability to build a diverse portfolio.
As a BDC, we are generally required to invest at least 70% of our total assets primarily in securities of private and certain U.S. public companies (other than certain financial institutions), cash, cash equivalents and U.S. government securities and other limited float high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less.
We are permitted to borrow money from time to time within the levels permitted by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”) that are applicable to us. Subject to the receipt of certain approvals and compliance with certain disclosure requirements, we are permitted to reduce our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act from 200% to 150% so long as we meet certain disclosure requirements and, since our securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, offer to repurchase the shares of our stockholders as of the applicable approval date. On September 23, 2020, our sole stockholder approved the application of the reduced asset coverage requirements to us and declined the Company’s offer to repurchase all of its outstanding shares of Common Stock. As a result, we are subject to the reduced asset coverage requirements in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, which permit a BDC to double the maximum amount of leverage that it is permitted to incur by reducing the asset coverage requirements applicable to such BDC from 200% to 150%.

Investment Strategy
Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in first and second lien senior secured loans, and to a lesser extent, mezzanine loans, unsecured loans and equity of predominantly private U.S. middle market companies. We define middle market companies as those with EBITDA of between $25 million and $100 million annually, although we may invest in larger or smaller companies. We also may purchase interests in loans or corporate bonds through secondary market transactions.
Senior secured loans generally are senior debt instruments that rank ahead of subordinated debt and equity in priority of payments and are generally secured by liens on the operating assets of a borrower which may include inventory, receivables, plant, property and equipment. Mezzanine debt is subordinated to senior loans and is generally unsecured.
In seeking this objective, we intend to target a differentiated investment strategy comprised of six key components:
•sourcing of primarily private debt opportunities through Benefit Street Partners’ extensive proprietary networks and close relationships;
•prioritization of non-competitive, “strategic capital” opportunities, including non-sponsored investments;
•creative and flexible approach to providing capital;
•optimization of investment level risk/return profile;
•maintaining downside protection through risk management and diversification; and
1 Assets under management represent all credit funds and separately managed accounts managed and administered by Benefit Street Partners or Alcentra. Benefit Street Partners acquired Alcentra on November 1, 2022.
•ability to take advantage of opportunities Benefit Street Partners believes are mispriced.
Sourcing of primarily private debt opportunities. At the heart of implementing the Company’s investment strategy is the Adviser’s approach to sourcing attractive private debt opportunities by capitalizing on Benefit Street Partners’ extensive relationships and insights.
This differentiated transaction-sourcing framework comprises hundreds of close, long-standing personal relationships that have been forged over the course of several decades and hundreds of transactions. Benefit Street Partners’ personnel have collectively been involved in thousands of credit transactions over the course of their careers as senior bankers at preeminent institutions at the center of the global credit markets. Primarily through hands-on, personal involvement in these investments and transactions, the Benefit Street Partners team has developed and maintained a broad and diverse network of contacts throughout the deal transaction ecosystem. This network is a rich source of proprietary idea and deal generation, often yielding a “first look” at attractive private debt opportunities.
Prioritize non-competitive, “strategic capital” opportunities. The Adviser seeks to prioritize non-competitive, “strategic capital” opportunities where BSP is well-positioned as a debt provider by virtue of its industry insights, capital markets expertise or other differentiating attributes. BSP participates in both transactions initiated with the backing of private equity firms and transactions without such backing and has historically followed a balanced approach to allocating into both types of deals. BSP incorporates a component of transactions without private equity backing into its managed portfolios because they are typically less competitive, and therefore often result in better yield and other terms per unit of risk than sponsored loans. Having said that, deals without private equity backing tend to be more sporadic in nature than sponsor deals. As such, the Company also expects to invest in private equity-backed loans with a focus on targeting non-competitive transactions. Ultimately, BSP evaluates the risk-reward profile of every investment on a case-by-case basis, and its primary aim is to participate in transactions where BSP has influence over terms, covenants and governance of these investments. In BSP’s experience, investment opportunities where BSP is viewed as provider of “strategic capital,” as opposed to just capital, have generally been more attractive from a risk-reward perspective.
Investment-level risk/return profile optimization. Every investment opportunity is evaluated on a standalone basis and must have an attractive risk-reward profile to be considered for an investment. As mentioned above, the Adviser prioritizes situations which are less competitive and where we are viewed as “strategic capital” providers by virtue of our Adviser's industry insights, capital markets expertise or other differentiating attribute. The Adviser prioritizes a combination of non-sponsored investment opportunities, which by their nature are less competitive, as well as non-competitive sponsored investment opportunities. Most importantly, every investment is evaluated individually with regard to its risk vs. reward profile. Our aim is to invest in opportunities where we are being paid higher yields for taking on a particular risk than what is contemplated in the broader market. Additionally, even though our investments are made from the bottom up, we aim to produce a broad portfolio of assets, which together are reflective of the types of risk we think are appropriate in any given environment. The Adviser intends to target investments for the Company where attractive returns and upside potential is accompanied by solid, reliable and measurable downside protection. In addition to downside protection that comes from the contractual nature of returns inherent in all debt structures, the Adviser plans to employ a wide range of investment-specific mechanisms to provide further downside protection in many of the Company’s investments, such as influencing financial covenants, reporting obligations or other specific terms of an investment.
Fund-level downside protection via risk management and broad based investment strategy. Transcending all components of the Company’s investment strategy is the overarching goal of downside protection at the fund-level through experienced portfolio management. Our Adviser seeks to accomplish this objective through disciplined application of risk management best practices across the portfolio combined with a broad based investment approach at the fund-level, and diversification across several discrete dimensions. Benefit Street Partners’ risk management practices are grounded in an established investment process comprising systematic underwriting, rigorous due diligence, third-party reports and investment committee approval accompanied by a proprietary and dynamic post-investment monitoring system for regularly updating issuer data. See “Item 1. Business — Investment Process”.
Ability to take advantage of opportunities Benefit Street Partners believes are mispriced. As a complement to its traditional middle market investments, our Adviser preserves the flexibility to invest opportunistically, including in opportunities it believes are mispriced. Throughout Benefit Street Partners’ history, its private debt funds have been opportunistic in identifying the best risk-adjusted returns as determined by market-driven factors. Benefit Street Partners and its affiliates have successfully invested in private debt across a credit cycle.
Investment Restrictions. The Company will not make any investment, directly or indirectly, in coal-related companies, oil or gas reserves or invest in portfolio companies primarily engaged in directly investing in the exploration for, or the production of, coal, oil and gas reserves.
Market Opportunity
We believe that there exists a unique opportunity for BDCs with experience in investing in middle market companies. In our view, middle market companies provide attractive current yields and significant downside protection. The Company also aims to target investments presented by the large, persistent and compelling market opportunity that has been created by a structural supply/demand imbalance for private credit, predominantly in North America. This imbalance is driven by substantial long-term changes in the debt capital markets following the credit crisis. Benefit Street Partners believes that the Company’s target market segment represents a large opportunity set for the Company, given Benefit Street Partners’ approximately $771 billion in assets under management which it believes can offer greater efficiencies with respect to research and origination, deep credit markets experience, and access to proprietary sourcing networks.
Our current opportunity is highlighted by the following factors:
Large, persistent and compelling market opportunity. The fundamental premise underpinning the Company’s investment thesis is that there is a compelling near- and medium-term opportunity to provide capital to middle market companies on attractive terms. This opportunity is a function of the size and growth rate of the middle market segment of the U.S. economy as well as a substantial, persistent and structurally-driven supply/demand imbalance for middle market debt capital across North America.
Large pool of uninvested private equity capital likely to seek additional capital to support private investments. We believe there remains a large pool of uninvested private equity capital available to middle market companies. We expect that private equity firms will be active investors in middle market companies and that these private equity firms will seek to supplement their equity investments with senior secured and mezzanine debt and equity co-investments from other sources, such as us.
Refinancing activities will provide continued opportunities to extend capital to middle market companies. As companies seek to refinance their debt, we believe this will create new financing opportunities for us.
Lower default rates and higher recovery rates in the middle market. Default rates remain relatively low, with generally higher recovery rates in the middle market. Middle market companies are generally over-equitized as compared to large cap companies.
Favorable pricing environment in the loan market. Lower valuation levels in certain situations, combined with reduced liquidity in the secondary loan market, have created opportunities to acquire relatively high yielding senior and subordinated debt, both secured and unsecured, at potentially attractive prices.
Investment Process
The investment process utilized by the Adviser for the Company’s investments consists of several distinct phases as summarized below:
Sourcing. The BSP credit team’s investment process typically begins with sourcing private debt opportunities through our extensive proprietary networks and other relationships (see “Item 1. Business — Investment Strategy”). Investment ideas deemed worthy of exploration are then channeled into a rigorous vetting process. Investment ideas are initially screened according to strict internal credit and pricing criteria. Ideas that pass this initial screen are then discussed among the broader Benefit Street Partners credit team. Only investment ideas that gain preliminary approval proceed to further evaluation.
Structuring. Investment ideas that receive favorable feedback result in a preliminary discussion with the proposed issuer under a non-disclosure agreement to confirm the issuer’s interest in the contemplated transaction prior to expending resources for full due diligence. During this phase, Benefit Street Partners focuses on creating a tailored financing solution for the company. Once created, the proposed solution is presented to the company so the company can consider whether the proposed structure makes sense. If both sides agree that the proposed financing solution is appropriate, a term sheet is generated, circulated and executed.
Investment Committee Preview. Upon execution of a term sheet, the deal team presents the terms and structure of the proposed investment to at least one member of the investment committee, for a full vetting. The current investment committee for the Adviser is composed of Messrs. Gahan, Paasche, Faulstich and Mahajan. The investment committee member will then either decline the opportunity or approve that the proposed investment proceed to full due diligence.
Full Due Diligence. Following the investment committee preview and approval, the deal team proceeds to full due diligence of the prospective investment and issuer. This phase of the investment process comprises all aspects of credit-oriented due diligence including fundamental financial and business analysis, comprehensive accounting and legal reviews, an overview of industry trends and business valuation. Benefit Street Partners’ fundamental analysis involves close scrutiny of financial statements to reveal key drivers of revenues, expenses and cash flow. Benefit Street Partners also typically conducts extensive management team interviews to uncover incremental insights into these drivers as well as other potential issues that could affect 
the company’s performance and its ability to service its debt obligations. To ensure completeness of its due diligence process, Benefit Street Partners supplements in-house resources as necessary with leading third-party specialists including accountants, appraisers, consultants and attorneys.
Final Investment Committee. Upon completion of full due diligence, the deal team formally presents the investment opportunity to the investment committee for approval. In addition to considering the proposed investment on its standalone merits, the investment committee considers the overall fit of the proposed investment within the portfolio. At least three of the four members of the investment committee must approve the transaction in order for the investment to go in the portfolio.
Investment and Monitoring. Completed investments are closely monitored and more formally reviewed, at the Adviser’s regular portfolio review meeting. BSP conducts regular meetings with management and stays in close contact with the issuer to ensure a steady stream of information (including compliance with loan covenants) and to get an early read on potential issues. Additionally, Benefit Street Partners conducts quarterly portfolio review meetings where it discusses and evaluates the entirety of the investments in its portfolio. In the event that actual or potential underperformance is identified, the investment will be discussed and evaluated accordingly and Benefit Street Partners may seek proactive protective measures including amendments, forbearance, waivers and retention of outside consultants.
Our Adviser employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Adviser grades the credit risk of all debt investments on a scale of 1 to 5 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio debt investment relative to the inherent risk at the time the original debt investment was made (i.e., at the time of acquisition), although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company’s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors.

Loan Rating | Summary Description 
 | Debt investment exceeding fundamental performance expectations and/or capital gain expected. Trends and risk factors since the time of investment are favorable. 
 | Performing consistent with expectations and a full return of principal and interest expected. Trends and risk factors are neutral to favorable. All investments are initially rated a “2”.
 | Performing debt investment requiring closer monitoring. Trends and risk factors show some deterioration. 
 | Underperforming debt investment. Some loss of interest or dividend expected, but still expecting a positive return on investment. Trends and risk factors are negative. 
 | Underperforming debt investment with expected loss of interest and some principal. 

Our Adviser’s internal performance ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or represent or reflect any third-party assessment of any of our investments.
The weighted average risk rating of our investments based on fair value was 2.1 and 2.0 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the company had no portfolio companies on non-accrual status, respectively.

Realization. The Company’s core strategy is to source and structure debt investments that will deliver strong returns when held to maturity or refinanced prior to maturity. However, we will consider, on a selective and opportunistic basis, exiting an investment earlier if we believe the accessible exit value has exceeded intrinsic value.
Potential Conflicts of Interest; Co-Investment Opportunities
The Adviser and its affiliates engage in a broad range of activities, including investment activities for their own account and for the account of other investment funds or accounts. In the ordinary course of conducting its activities, the interests of the Company may conflict with the interests of the Adviser, or other funds advised by the Adviser or its affiliates and there is no guarantee that such conflicts will ultimately be resolved in favor of the Company. A description of certain of these potential conflicts of interest is provided below. The discussion below does not describe all conflicts that may arise.
Investment Advisory Agreement
We entered into an investment advisory agreement (the “Investment Advisory Agreement”), dated September 23, 2020, with our Adviser in which the Adviser, subject to the overall supervision of the Company’s Board of Directors, manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory services to us. The Adviser and its affiliates also provide investment advisory services to other funds that have investment mandates that are similar, in whole and in part, with ours. The Adviser and its affiliates serve as investment adviser or sub-adviser to private funds, registered open-end funds, a BDC and a public real estate investment trust. In addition, any affiliated fund currently formed or formed in the future and managed by the Adviser or its affiliates may have overlapping investment objectives with our own and, accordingly, may invest in asset classes similar to those targeted by us. However, in certain instances due to regulatory, tax, investment, or other restrictions, certain investment opportunities may not be appropriate for either us or other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates. The Board of Directors renewed the Investment Advisory Agreement on January 30, 2023.
Management Fee
The Management Fee is payable quarterly in arrears and is calculated based on the average value of the Company’s gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, where gross assets includes the total assets of the Company, including any borrowings for investment purposes.
Prior to a liquidity event, the Management Fee payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement will be calculated at an annual rate of 0.5% of the Company’s average gross assets. A “liquidity event” is defined as any of: (1) a merger or another transaction approved by the Board of Directors in which the Company’s stockholders will receive cash or shares of a publicly traded company (or a company that becomes publicly traded concurrently with the closing of such transaction), which may include an entity advised by the Adviser or its affiliates, (2) an initial public offering (“IPO”) or a listing (an “Exchange Listing”) of the Common Stock on a national securities exchange, or (3) the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets either on a complete portfolio basis or individually followed by a liquidation.
After a liquidity event, the Management Fee payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement will be calculated at an annual rate of 1.50% of the Company’s average gross assets, provided, that the Management Fee will be calculated at an annual rate of 1.00% of the Company’s average gross assets purchased with borrowed funds above 1.0x debt-to-equity (equivalent to $1 of debt outstanding for each $1 of equity), and provided further that for a period of 15 months commencing on the date of the closing of a liquidity event, the Adviser will irrevocably waive Management Fees in excess of 0.5% of the Company’s average gross assets. Any fees waived under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not subject to reimbursement to the Adviser.
Incentive Fee
The Company will also pay the Adviser an Incentive Fee consisting of two parts, which are described below. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Adviser will waive all Incentive Fees for the first twelve calendar quarters of operations of the Company.
The incentive fee consists of two parts. The first part is referred to as the “incentive fee on income” and it is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the Company’s “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” for the immediately preceding quarter.
“Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees, other than fees for providing managerial assistance, such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus the Company’s operating expenses for the quarter (including the Management Fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement (as defined below) and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount debt instruments with payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. For purposes of computing the Company’s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, the calculation methodology will look through total return swaps as if the Company owned the referenced assets directly.
For periods ending on or prior to the date of the closing of a liquidity event, the incentive fee on income with respect to the Company’s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income will be calculated as follows:
•No incentive fee on income in any calendar quarter in which the Company’s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the preferred return rate of 1.50%, or 6.00% annualized (the “Preferred Return”), on net assets;
•100% of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the Preferred Return but is less than or equal to 1.765% in any calendar quarter (7.06% annualized). This portion of the incentive fee on income is referred to as the “catch up” and is intended to provide the Adviser with an incentive fee of 15% on all of the Company’s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income when the Company’s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income reaches 1.765% (7.06% annualized) in any calendar quarter; and
•For any quarter in which Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds 1.765% (7.06% annualized), the incentive fee on income equals 15% of the amount of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, as the Preferred Return and catch-up will have been achieved.
For any period ending after the closing of a liquidity event, the incentive fee on income for each quarter will be calculated as follows:
•No incentive fee on income in any calendar quarter in which Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the Preferred Return of 1.50%, or 6.00% annualized, on net assets;
•100% of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the Preferred Return but is less than or equal to 1.8175% in any calendar quarter (7.27% annualized), which portion of the incentive fee on income is referred to as the “catch up” and is intended to provide the Adviser with an incentive fee of 17.5% on all of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income when Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income reaches 1.8175% (7.27% annualized) in any calendar quarter; and
•For any quarter in which Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds 1.8175% (7.27% annualized), the incentive fee on income equals 17.5% of the amount of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, as the Preferred Return and catch-up will have been achieved.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, for a period of 15 months commencing on the date of the closing of a liquidity event, the Adviser will irrevocably waive any incentive fee on income otherwise payable in excess of any amounts calculated at the pre-IPO or pre-Exchange Listing rates. Any fees waived under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not subject to reimbursement to the Adviser.
The second part of the incentive fee, referred to as the “incentive fee on capital gains during operations,” is an incentive fee on capital gains earned on cumulative realized capital gains of the Company net of cumulative realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation and is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, if earlier). Prior to a liquidity event, this fee equals 15% of the Company’s incentive fee capital gains, which equals realized capital gains of the Company on a cumulative basis from the date of the Company’s election to be regulated as a BDC, calculated as of the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fee on capital gains during operations. Following a liquidity event, the incentive fee on capital gains during operations equals 17.5% of the Company’s incentive fee capital gains calculated as described above, on a cumulative basis from the date of the Company’s election to be regulated as a BDC.
Duration and termination
The Adviser serves as our investment adviser pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, which was initially approved by our Board of Directors in March 2020. The Board most recently approved the Investment Advisory Agreement in January 2023, and unless terminated earlier, it will remain in effect from year to year if approved annually by our Board of Directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons. The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. The Investment Advisory Agreement may be terminated by us without penalty upon not less than 60 days’ written notice and by the Adviser upon not less than 60 days' written notice. Any termination by us must be authorized either by our Board of Directors or by vote of our stockholders.
In determining to approve the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Board of Directors requested information from the Adviser that enabled it to evaluate a number of factors relevant to its determination. These factors included the nature, extent and quality of services provided to us by the Adviser, the costs of providing services to us, the profitability of the relationship between us and the Adviser, comparative information on fees and expenses borne by other comparable BDCs or registered investment companies and, as applicable, other advised accounts, and the extent to which economies of scale would be realized as we grow and whether fee levels reflect these economies of scale for the benefit of our investors. Based on the information reviewed and the considerations detailed above, our Board of Directors, including all of our directors who are not interested persons of us or the Adviser, concluded that the investment advisory fee rates and terms are fair and reasonable in relation to the services provided and approved the Investment Advisory Agreement as being in the best interests of our stockholders. 
Indemnification
The Investment Advisory Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, the Adviser and its officers, managers, partners, members (and their members, including the owners of their members), agents, employees, controlling persons, and any other person or entity affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of the Adviser’s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement or otherwise as our investment adviser.
Administration Agreements
We entered into an administration agreement with Benefit Street Partners, dated as of September 23, 2020 (the “Administration Agreement”), in which Benefit Street Partners (in such capacity, the "Administrator") provided us with office facilities and certain administrative services. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement with our Administrator, the Administrator will provide the Company with office facilities and certain administrative services necessary for the Company to conduct its business. The Company will reimburse the Administrator for expenses incurred in administering the Company’s business, including the Company’s allocable portion of overhead and certain other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement.
Our Board of Directors, including a majority of the independent directors, will review the reimbursement of costs and expenses to the Administrator to determine if the provisions of the Administration Agreement are carried out satisfactorily and to determine whether the reimbursement of costs and expenses under the Administration Agreement are reasonable and appropriate. Our Board of Directors will also review the methodology employed in determining how costs and expenses are allocated to the Company and the proposed allocation of administrative expenses among the Company and affiliates of the Administrator.
On January 5, 2020, we entered into a fund administration servicing agreement and a fund accounting servicing agreement with U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC (the “USB Administrator”). USB Administrator provides the administrative services, such as accounting, financial reporting, legal, and compliance support, and investor relations support, necessary for us to operate.
Co-Investment Relief
The 1940 Act generally prohibits BDCs from entering into negotiated co-investments with affiliates absent an order from the SEC. The SEC staff has granted the Company exemptive relief that allows it to enter into certain negotiated co-investment transactions alongside with other funds managed by the Adviser or its affiliates (“Affiliated Funds”) in a manner consistent with its investment objective, positions, policies, strategies, and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, subject to compliance with certain conditions (the “Order”). Pursuant to the Order, the Company is permitted to co-invest with its affiliates if a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of its eligible directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transactions, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Company and the Company's stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of the Company or the Company's stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of the Company’s stockholders and is consistent with the Company’s investment objective and strategies.
Private Placement
Our initial private placement of shares of Common Stock is conducted in reliance on Regulation D under the Securities Act (“Regulation D”) or Regulation S under the Securities Act (“Regulation S”). Investors in our initial private placement are required to be “accredited investors” as defined in Regulation D of the Securities Act or non-U.S. persons under Regulation S.
Each investor in the private placement made a Capital Commitment to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Subscription Agreement. Investors are required to make capital contributions to purchase shares of Common Stock (the “Drawdown Purchase Price”) each time we deliver a drawdown notice (the “Drawdown Notice”), which will be delivered at least ten business days prior to the required funding date, in an aggregate amount not to exceed their respective Capital Commitments. All purchases will generally be made pro rata in accordance with the investors’ Capital Commitments, at a per-share price as determined by the Board of Directors in accordance with the limitations under Section 23 of the 1940 Act, provided that the Company retains the right to make non-pro rata capital drawdowns for any reason in the Company’s sole discretion, including, without limitation, if the Company determines that it is necessary or advisable in light of applicable legal, tax, regulatory and other considerations. As set forth in each Subscription Agreement, in the event that an investor fails to pay all or any portion of a Drawdown Purchase Price pursuant to a Drawdown Notice, and such default remains uncured for a period of thirty days (such investor, a “Defaulting Subscriber”), the Company will be permitted to pursue any remedies against the Defaulting Subscriber available under the Subscription Agreement or at law or at equity, including prohibiting the Defaulting Subscriber from purchasing additional shares of Common Stock or causing the Defaulting Subscriber to forfeit 50% of the Defaulting Subscriber’s shares of Common Stock to the other stockholders.
Closings of our private placement were expected to occur, from time to time, during the 12 month period following the Initial Closing (the “Initial Closing Period”), provided that the Board of Directors may extend the Initial Closing Period in its sole discretion. On November 9, 2021, the Board of Directors extended the Initial Closing Period to December 18, 2022. On December 16, 2022, the Board of Directors extended the Initial Closing Period to December 18, 2023.
Term
Drawdowns of Capital Commitments are made at the discretion of the Adviser until the earlier of (i) a liquidity event or (ii) the two-year anniversary of the end of the Initial Closing Period, provided that this period may be extended by an additional one-year extension in the discretion of the Board of Directors (the “Drawdown Period”).
After the end of the Drawdown Period, the Company may draw down Capital Commitments to the extent necessary to: (a) pay Company expenses, including any amounts that may become due under any borrowings or other financings or similar obligations, any indemnity obligations or other liabilities and including expenses under the Administration Agreement or Investment Advisory Agreement, and/or (b) complete portfolio investments with respect to which commitments have been made or for which the Company has entered into a letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, written bid letter, written agreement in principle or other binding written agreement as of the end of the Drawdown Period and/or prior to the start of any suspension of the Drawdown Period (including investments that are funded in phases).
We define a “liquidity event” as any of: (1) a merger or another transaction approved by the Board of Directors in which the Company’s stockholders will receive cash or shares of a publicly traded company (or a company that becomes publicly traded concurrently with the closing of such transaction), which may include an entity advised by the Adviser or its affiliates, (2) an initial public offering (“IPO”) or a listing (an “Exchange Listing”) of the Common Stock on a national securities exchange, or (3) the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets either on a complete portfolio basis or individually followed by a liquidation. There can be no assurance of when or if a liquidity event will occur. Furthermore, should there be an IPO or Exchange Listing, our stockholders will be subject to a lock-up restriction that will extend up to six months after the closing of such IPO or Exchange Listing pursuant to which they will be prohibited from selling or otherwise transferring shares of our Common Stock. 
Valuation Procedures
The Adviser, acting pursuant to delegated authority from, and under the oversight of our Board of Directors, determines the NAV of our investment portfolio each quarter and at such other times as may be required by law. The NAV per share of our outstanding shares of Common Stock is determined quarterly by dividing the value of total assets minus liabilities by the total number of shares outstanding. Securities for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the reported closing price on the valuation date. Securities for which market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined by our valuation designee (the “Valuation Designee”). In connection with that determination, our Valuation Designee utilizes independent valuation firms, portfolio company valuations using relevant inputs, including but not limited to, indicative dealer quotes, values of like securities, the most recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts.
We classify the fair value measurements of our assets and liabilities into a fair value hierarchy in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. The guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The guidance also establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, which includes inputs such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets and quoted prices for identical securities where there is little or no activity in the market; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our Valuation Designee undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:
•Each portfolio company or investment will be valued by our Valuation Designee, with assistance from one or more independent valuation firms engaged by the Company’s Board of Directors; and
•The independent valuation firm(s) conduct independent appraisals and make an independent assessment of the value of each investment; and
•Our Valuation Designee, under the supervision of the Board of Directors, determines the fair value of each investment, in good faith, based on the input of the Adviser and independent valuation firm (to the extent applicable) and our Valuation Designee’s own analysis. Our Valuation Designee also has established a Valuation Committee to assist our Valuation Designee in carrying out its designated responsibilities, subject to oversight of the Board of Directors.
Determination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates. Below is a description of factors that our Valuation Designee may consider when valuing our debt and equity investments.
Securities for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange are valued at the reported closing price on the valuation date. Our Valuation Designee may also obtain quotes with respect to certain of our investments from pricing services or brokers or dealers in order to value assets. When doing so, we determine whether the quote obtained is readily available according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) to determine the fair value of the security. If determined to be readily available, we use the quote obtained.
Investments without a readily available market quotation are primarily valued using a market approach, an income approach, or both approaches, as appropriate. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, cash flows or earnings) to a single present amount (discounted). The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. In following these approaches, the types of factors that our Valuation Designee may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include, as relevant: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables, applicable market yields and multiples, security covenants, call protection provisions, information rights, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company’s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public, M&A comparables, and enterprise values, among other factors. When available, broker quotations and/or quotations provided by pricing services are considered as an input in the valuation process.
Regulation as a Business Development Company
General
We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates, principal underwriters and the affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters. The 1940 Act also requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities. The 1940 Act defines “a majority of the outstanding voting securities” as the lesser of (i) 67% or more of the voting securities present at a meeting if the holders of more than 50% of our outstanding voting securities are present or represented by proxy or (ii) 50% of our voting securities.
We are generally not able to issue and sell our Common Stock at a price below NAV per share. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Business Development Companies — Regulations governing our operation as a BDC and RIC will affect our ability to raise, and the way in which we raise, additional capital or borrow for investment purposes, which may have a negative effect on our growth.” We may, however, sell our Common Stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our Common Stock, at a price below the then current NAV of our Common Stock if the Board of Directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. In addition, we may generally issue new shares of our Common Stock at a price below NAV in rights offerings to existing stockholders, in payment of dividends and in certain other limited circumstances.
We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misconduct, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.
As a BDC, we may be examined periodically by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act. Our Adviser is a registered investment adviser and is also subject to examination by the SEC.
Qualifying Assets
As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, we have to invest at least 70% of our total assets in “qualifying assets,” including securities of U.S. operating companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, U.S. operating companies with listed securities that have equity market capitalizations of less than $250 million, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less.
Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company’s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are any of the following:
1.Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which:
a.is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;
b.is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and
c.satisfies any of the following:
i.does not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange;
ii.has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million;
iii.is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC and the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or
iv.is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4.0 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2.0 million.
2.Securities of any eligible portfolio company that we control.
3.Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.
4.Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.
5.Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.
6.Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.
In addition, a BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above.
Temporary Investments
Pending investment in other types of “qualifying assets,” as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price that is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our Adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions.
Significant Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies
A BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in “Regulation-Qualifying Assets” above. BDCs generally must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities significant managerial assistance, except in circumstances where either (i) the BDC controls such issuer of securities or (ii) the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together and one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company.
Indebtedness and Senior Securities
We are permitted, under specified conditions, to borrow money and issue multiple classes of debt and one class of stock senior to our Common Stock if our asset coverage, which as defined in the 1940 Act, measures the ratio of total assets less total liabilities not represented by senior securities to total borrowings, is at least equal to 150% immediately after each such issuance. The application of the 150% asset coverage requirement permits us to double the maximum amount of leverage that we are permitted to incur as compared to BDCs who have not obtained the requisite approvals and made the required disclosures. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provision to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Business Development Companies - Regulations governing our operation as a BDC and RIC will affect our ability to raise, and the way in which we raise, additional capital or borrow for investment purposes, which may have a negative effect on our growth.”
Code of Ethics
We have adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code’s requirements.
Compliance Policies and Procedures
We and our Adviser have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws, and our Board of Directors is required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually to assess their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. We have designated Guy F. Talarico as our chief compliance officer.
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
We delegate our proxy voting responsibility to our Adviser. The proxy voting policies and procedures that our Adviser follows are set forth below and are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. The guidelines will be reviewed periodically by our Adviser and our non-interested directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change.
As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, our Adviser has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, it recognizes that it must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of its clients.
Our Adviser will vote proxies relating to our securities in the best interest of its clients’ stockholders. It will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted for a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by its clients. Although our Adviser will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on its clients’ portfolio securities, it may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons to do so.
The proxy voting decisions of our Adviser are made by the senior officers who are responsible for monitoring each of its clients’ investments. To ensure that its vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, it will require that: (a) anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to its chief compliance officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (b) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how our Adviser intends to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties.
You may obtain information, without charge, regarding how we voted proxies with respect to our portfolio securities by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Chief Financial Officer, 9 West 57th Street, 49th Floor, Suite 4920, New York, NY 10019.
Privacy Notice
Financial companies choose how they share investors’ personal information. Federal law gives our clients the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us to tell investors how we collect, share, and protect their personal information.
We do not disclose nonpublic personal information about our investors or former investors to third parties other than as described below.
We collect personal information about investors in connection with our providing advisory services to them. This information includes investors’ social security number and may include other information such as investors’:
•assets;
•investment experience;
•transaction history;
•income; and
•wire instructions.
We collect this information from investors through various means. For example, when investors give us their contact information, enter into an investment advisory contract with us, buy securities (i.e., interests in a fund) from us, tell us where to send money, or make a wire transfer. We also may collect investors’ personal information from other sources, such as our affiliates2 or other non-affiliated companies.
2 Our affiliates are companies related to us by common ownership or control and can include both financial and nonfinancial companies. Non-affiliates are companies not related to us by common ownership or control and can include both financial and nonfinancial companies.
All financial companies need to share customers’ personal information to run their everyday business and we use the personal information we collect from investors for our everyday business purposes or as permitted by law. These purposes may include for example:
•To provide advisory services to investors;
•To open an account for investors;
•To process a transaction for investors’ account;
•To market products and services to investors; and
•To respond to court orders and legal investigations.
We may provide investors’ personal information to our affiliates and to firms that assist us in servicing such investors’ account and have a need for such information, such as a broker or fund administrator. We may also disclose such information to service providers and financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing arrangements (i.e., a formal agreement between nonaffiliated financial companies that together market financial products or services to investors, such as placement agents). We require third-party service providers and financial institutions with which we have joint marketing arrangements to protect the confidentiality of investors’ information and to use the information only for the purposes for which we disclose the information to them. These sharing practices are consistent with federal privacy and related laws, and in general, investors may not limit our use of their personal information for these purposes under such laws. We note that the federal privacy laws only give investors the right to limit the certain types of information sharing that we do not engage in (e.g., sharing with our affiliates certain information relating to investors’ transaction history or creditworthiness for their use in marketing to such investors, or sharing any personal information with nonaffiliates for them to market to such investors).
To protect investors’ personal information from unauthorized access and use, we use security measures that comply with federal law. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings.
JOBS Act
We currently are and expect to remain an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”), until the earliest of:
•the last day of our fiscal year in which the fifth anniversary of an Exchange Listing occurs;
•the end of the fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues first exceed $1.07 billion;
•the date on which we have, during the prior three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; and
•the last day of a fiscal year in which we (1) have an aggregate worldwide market value of shares of our Common Stock held by non-affiliates of $700 million or more, computed at the end of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter in such fiscal year and (2) have been an Exchange Act reporting company for at least one year (and filed at least one annual report under the Exchange Act).
Under the JOBS Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”), we are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which would require that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, until such time as we cease to be an emerging growth company and become an accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. This may increase the risk that material weaknesses or other deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting go undetected.
Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have made an irrevocable election not to take advantage of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards. We therefore are subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
Exchange Act and Sarbanes-Oxley Act
We are subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the Exchange Act, including the filing of quarterly, annual and current reports, proxy statements and other required items. In addition, we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example:
•pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer are required to certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports;
•pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports are required to disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures;
•pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our management is required to prepare a report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; and
•pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We will monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.
Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations 
The following discussion is a general summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to us and to an investment in our Common Stock. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of the income tax considerations applicable to us or our investors on such an investment. For example, we have not described tax consequences that we assume to be generally known by investors or certain considerations that may be relevant to certain types of holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, including stockholders subject to the alternative minimum tax, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, dealers in securities, pension plans and trusts, financial institutions, U.S. stockholders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, persons who mark-to-market our shares and persons who hold our shares as part of a “straddle”, “hedge” or “conversion” transaction. This summary assumes that investors hold our Common Stock as capital assets (within the meaning of the Code). The discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations, each as of the date of this filing and all of which are subject to change, possibly retroactively, which could affect the continuing validity of this discussion. We have not sought and will not seek any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, regarding this follow-on offering. This summary does not discuss any aspects of U.S. estate or gift tax or foreign, state or local tax. It does not discuss the special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws that could result if we invested in tax-exempt securities or certain other investment assets.
For purposes of our discussion, a “U.S. stockholder” means a beneficial owner of shares of our Common Stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
•a citizen or individual resident of the United States;
•a corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
•a trust if (1) a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) it has a valid election in place to be treated as a U.S. person.
For purposes of our discussion, a “Non-U.S. stockholder” means a beneficial owner of shares of our Common Stock that is neither a U.S. stockholder nor a partnership (including an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes).
If a partnership (including an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds shares of our Common Stock, the tax treatment of a partner or member of the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A prospective stockholder that is a partner in a partnership holding shares of our Common Stock should consult his, her or its tax advisors with respect to the purchase, ownership and disposition of shares of our Common Stock.
Tax matters are very complicated and the tax consequences to an investor of an investment in our shares will depend on the facts of his, her or its particular situation. We encourage investors to consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific consequences of such an investment, including tax reporting requirements, the applicability of U.S. Federal, state, local and foreign tax laws, eligibility for the benefits of any applicable tax treaty and the effect of any possible changes in the tax laws.
Election to Be Taxed as a RIC 
We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2020 and intend to qualify annually thereafter as a RIC. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income that we distribute to our stockholders from our taxable earnings and profits. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, in order to obtain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our “investment company taxable income,” which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gain over realized net long-term capital loss, (the “Annual Distribution Requirement”). Even if we qualify as a RIC, we generally will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed taxable income and could be subject to U.S. federal excise, state, local and foreign taxes.
Taxation as a RIC 
Provided that we qualify as a RIC and satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain (which generally is defined as net long-term capital gain in excess of net short-term capital loss) that we timely distribute to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gain not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders.
We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income of RICs unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of: (1) 98% of our ordinary income for each calendar year; (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending December 31 in that calendar year; and (3) any income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax.
We have formed consolidated subsidiaries that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes although not for income tax purposes (the “Consolidated Holding Companies”). These Consolidated Holding Companies enable us to hold equity securities of portfolio companies organized as pass-through entities while continuing to satisfy the requirements of a RIC under the Code. See “Item 1. Business — Regulation as a business Development Company” for discussion of BDC regulation and other regulatory considerations.
In order to qualify to be treated as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things: qualify to be treated as a BDC or be registered as a management investment company under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year; meet the Annual Distribution Requirement; derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or other securities or currencies or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies and net income derived from an interest in a “qualified publicly traded partnership” as defined in the Code (the “90% Income Test”); and diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year: (i) at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer (which for these purposes includes the equity securities of a “qualified publicly traded partnership”); and (ii) no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. Government securities or securities of other RICs, (i) of one issuer (ii) of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or (iii) of one or more “qualified publicly traded partnerships,” or the Diversification Tests. To the extent that we invest in entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes (other than a “qualified publicly traded partnership”), we generally must include the items of gross income derived by the partnerships for purposes of the 90% Income Test, and the income that is derived from a partnership (other than a “qualified publicly traded partnership”) will be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test only to the extent that such income is attributable to items of income of the partnership which would be qualifying income if realized by us directly. In addition, we generally must take into account our proportionate share of the assets held by partnerships (other than a “qualified publicly traded partnership”) in which we are a partner for purposes of the Diversification Tests.
In determining whether or not a RIC is in compliance with the Diversification Tests, the 90% Income Test and the Annual Distribution Requirement, a RIC may take into consideration certain cure provisions contained in the Code.
In order to meet the 90% Income Test, we may establish one or more special purpose corporations to hold assets from which we do not anticipate earning dividend, interest or other qualifying income under the 90% Income Test. Any investments held through a special purpose corporation would generally be subject to U.S. federal income and other taxes, and therefore we can expect to achieve a reduced after-tax yield on such investments.
We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive a corresponding payment in cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock. We anticipate that a portion of our income may constitute original issue discount or other income required to be included in taxable income prior to receipt of cash.
Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of the accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. As a result, we may have difficulty meeting the Annual Distribution Requirement necessary to obtain and maintain RIC tax treatment under the Code. We may have to sell some of our investments at times and/or at prices we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or forgo new investment opportunities for this purpose. If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment and thus become subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax.
Furthermore, a portfolio company in which we invest may face financial difficulty that requires us to work-out, modify or otherwise restructure our investment in the portfolio company. Any such restructuring may result in unusable capital losses and future non-cash income. Any restructuring may also result in our recognition of a substantial amount of non-qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test, such as cancellation of indebtedness income in connection with the work-out of a leveraged investment (which, while not free from doubt, may be treated as non-qualifying income) or the receipt of other non-qualifying income.
Gain or loss realized by us from warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants will generally be treated as capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term or short-term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant.
Our investment in non-U.S. securities may be subject to non-U.S. income, withholding and other taxes. In that case, our yield on those securities would be decreased. Stockholders will generally not be entitled to claim a credit or deduction with respect to non-U.S. taxes paid by us.
If we purchase shares in a “passive foreign investment company,” or PFIC, we may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a portion of any “excess distribution” or gain from the disposition of such shares even if such income is distributed as a taxable dividend by us to our stockholders. Additional charges in the nature of interest may be imposed on us in respect of deferred taxes arising from such distributions or gains. If we invest in a PFIC and elect to treat the PFIC as a “qualified electing fund” under the Code, or QEF, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, we will be required to include in income each year a portion of the ordinary earnings and net capital gain of the QEF, even if such income is not distributed to it. Alternatively, we can elect to mark-to-market at the end of each taxable year our shares in a PFIC; in this case, we will recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such shares and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it does not exceed prior increases included in income. Under either election, we may be required to recognize in a year income in excess of our distributions from PFICs and our proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock during that year, and such income will nevertheless be subject to the Annual Distribution Requirement and will be taken into account for purposes of the 4% U.S. federal excise tax. We intend to limit and/or manage our holdings in PFICs to minimize our liability for any taxes and related interest charges. In addition, income required to be included as a result of a QEF election would be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test if we receive a distribution of such income from the PFIC in the same taxable year to which the inclusion relates, or if the included income is derived with respect to our business of investing.
Under Section 988 of the Code, gain or loss attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the time we accrue income, expenses, or other liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and the time we actually collect such income or pay such expenses or liabilities are generally treated as ordinary income or loss. Similarly, gain or loss on foreign currency forward contracts and the disposition of debt denominated in a foreign currency, to the extent attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the acquisition and disposition dates, are also treated as ordinary income or loss.
Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain “asset coverage” tests are met. See “Item 1. Business — Regulation as a Business Development Company — Qualifying Assets” and “— Indebtedness and Senior Securities.” Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or to avoid the excise tax, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous.
If we fail to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement or otherwise fail to qualify as a RIC in any taxable year, we will be subject to tax in that year on all of our taxable income, regardless of whether we make any distributions to our stockholders. In that case, all of such income will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax, reducing the amount available to be distributed to our stockholders. See “Item 1. Business — Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations — Failure To Obtain RIC Tax Treatment.”
As a RIC, we are not allowed to carry forward or carry back a net operating loss for purposes of computing our investment company taxable income in other taxable years. U.S. federal income tax law generally permits a RIC to carry forward (i) the excess of its net short-term capital loss over its net long-term capital gain for a given year as a short-term capital loss arising on the first day of the following year and (ii) the excess of its net long-term capital loss over its net short-term capital gain for a given year as a long-term capital loss arising on the first day of the following year. However, future transactions we engage in may cause our ability to use any capital loss carryforwards, and unrealized losses once realized, to be limited under Section 382 of the Code. Certain of our investment practices may be subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, (i) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, (ii) convert lower taxed long-term capital gain and qualified dividend income into higher taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary income, (iii) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (iv) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash, (v) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur, (vi) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions, and (vii) produce income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test. We will monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections in order to mitigate the effect of these provisions.
As described above, to the extent that we invest in equity securities of entities that are treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the effect of such investments for purposes of the 90% Income Test and the Diversification Tests will depend on whether or not the partnership is a “qualified publicly traded partnership” (as defined in the Code). If the partnership is a “qualified publicly traded partnership,” the net income derived from such investments will be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test and will be “securities” for purposes of the Diversification Tests. If the partnership, however, is not treated as a “qualified publicly traded partnership,” the consequences of an investment in the partnership will depend upon the amount and type of income of the partnership allocable to us and our proportionate share of the underlying assets of the partnership. The income derived from such investments may not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test and, therefore, could adversely affect our qualification as a RIC. We intend to monitor our investments in equity securities of entities that are treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes to prevent our disqualification as a RIC.
We may invest in preferred securities or other securities the U.S. federal income tax treatment of which may not be clear or may be subject to recharacterization by the IRS. To the extent the tax treatment of such securities or the income from such securities differs from the expected tax treatment, it could affect the timing or character of income recognized, requiring us to purchase or sell securities, or otherwise change our portfolio, in order to comply with the tax rules applicable to RICs under the Code.
Taxation of U.S. Stockholders 
Whether an investment in shares of our Common Stock is appropriate for a U.S. stockholder will depend upon that person’s particular circumstances. An investment in shares of our Common Stock by a U.S. stockholder may have adverse tax consequences. The following summary generally describes certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in shares of our Common Stock by taxable U.S. stockholders and not by U.S. stockholders that are generally exempt from U.S. federal income taxation. U.S. stockholders should consult their own tax advisors before making an investment in our Common Stock.
Distributions by us generally are taxable to U.S. stockholders as ordinary income or capital gain. Distributions of our “investment company taxable income” (which is, generally, our ordinary income excluding net capital gain) will be taxable as ordinary income to U.S. stockholders to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, whether paid in cash or reinvested in additional common stock. To the extent such distributions paid by us to noncorporate U.S. stockholders (including individuals) are attributable to dividends from U.S. corporations and certain qualified foreign corporations, such distributions generally will be eligible for taxation at rates applicable to “qualifying dividends” (at a maximum tax rate of 20%) provided that we properly report such distribution as “qualified dividend income” and certain holding period and other requirements are satisfied. In this regard, it is not anticipated that a significant portion of distributions paid by us will be attributable to qualifying dividends; therefore, our distributions generally will not qualify for the preferential rates applicable to qualified dividend income. Distributions of our net capital gain (which is generally our net long-term capital gain in excess of net short-term capital loss) properly reported by us as “capital gain dividends” will be taxable to a U.S. stockholder as long-term capital gain (at a maximum rate of 20% in the case of individuals, trusts or estates), regardless of the U.S. stockholder’s holding period for his, her or its common stock and regardless of whether paid in cash or reinvested in additional common stock. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits first will reduce a U.S. stockholder’s adjusted tax basis in such stockholder’s common stock and, after the adjusted basis is reduced to zero, will constitute capital gain to such U.S. stockholder.
U.S. Stockholders who receive distributions in the form of stock generally are subject to the same federal income tax consequences as are stockholders who elect to receive their distributions in cash. The U.S. stockholder will have an adjusted tax basis in the additional shares of our Common Stock purchased through the plan equal to the amount of the reinvested distribution. The additional shares will have a new holding period commencing on the day following the day on which the shares are credited to the U.S. stockholder’s account.
Although we currently intend to distribute any long-term capital gain at least annually, we may in the future decide to retain some or all of our long-term capital gain, but designate the retained amount as a “deemed distribution.” In that case, among other consequences, we will pay tax on the retained amount, each U.S. stockholder will be required to include his, her or its proportionate share of the deemed distribution in income as if it had been actually distributed to the U.S. stockholder, and the U.S. stockholder will be entitled to claim a credit equal to his, her or its allocable share of the tax paid thereon by us. The amount of the deemed distribution net of such tax will be added to the U.S. stockholder’s tax basis for his, her or its common stock. Since we expect to pay tax on any retained capital gain at our regular corporate tax rate, and since that rate is in excess of the maximum rate currently payable by individuals on net capital gain, the amount of tax that individual stockholders will be treated as having paid and for which they will receive a credit will exceed the tax they owe on the retained net capital gain. Such excess generally may be claimed as a credit against the U.S. stockholder’s other U.S. federal income tax obligations or may be refunded to the extent it exceeds a stockholder’s liability for U.S. federal income tax. A stockholder that is not subject to U.S. federal income tax or otherwise required to file a U.S. federal income tax return would be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return on the appropriate form in order to claim a refund for the taxes we paid. In order to utilize the deemed distribution approach, we must provide written notice to our stockholders prior to the expiration of 60 days after the close of the relevant taxable year. We cannot treat any of our investment company taxable income as a “deemed distribution.”
For purposes of determining (1) whether the Annual Distribution Requirement is satisfied for any year and (2) the amount of capital gain dividends paid for that year, we may, under certain circumstances, elect to treat a dividend that is paid during the following taxable year as if it had been paid during the taxable year in question. If we make such an election, the U.S. stockholder will still be treated as receiving the dividend in the taxable year in which the distribution is made. However, any dividend declared by us in October, November or December of any calendar year, payable to stockholders of record on a specified date in any such month and actually paid during January of the following year, will be treated as if it had been received by our U.S. stockholders on December 31 of the year in which the dividend was declared.
We may have the ability to declare a large portion of a distribution in shares of our Common Stock to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement. If a portion of such distribution is paid in cash (which portion may be as low as 20% based on certain public and private rulings issued by the IRS) and certain requirements are met, the entire distribution to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. stockholders will be taxed on the distribution as if the entire distribution was cash distribution, even though most of the distribution was paid in shares of our Common Stock.
If an investor purchases shares of our Common Stock shortly before the record date of a distribution, the price of the shares will include the value of the distribution and the investor will be subject to tax on the distribution even though it represents a return of his, her or its investment.
A U.S. stockholder generally will recognize taxable gain or loss if the stockholder sells or otherwise disposes of his, her or its shares of our Common Stock. The amount of gain or loss will be measured by the difference between such stockholder’s adjusted tax basis in the common stock sold and the amount of the proceeds received in exchange. Any gain arising from such sale or disposition generally will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the stockholder has held his, her or its shares for more than one year.
Otherwise, it will be classified as short-term capital gain or loss. However, any capital loss arising from the sale or disposition of shares of our Common Stock held for six months or less will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent of the amount of capital gain dividends received, or undistributed capital gain deemed received, with respect to such shares. In addition, all or a portion of any loss recognized upon a disposition of shares of our Common Stock may be disallowed if other substantially identical shares are purchased (whether through reinvestment of distributions or otherwise) within 30 days before or after the disposition. The ability to otherwise deduct capital loss may be subject to other limitations under the Code.
In general, U.S. stockholders taxed at individual rates currently are subject to a maximum U.S. federal income tax rate of 20% on their recognized net capital gain (i.e., the excess of realized net long-term capital gains over realized net short-term capital losses), including any long-term capital gain derived from an investment in our shares. Such rate is lower than the maximum rate on ordinary income currently payable by such U.S. stockholders. In addition, individuals with modified adjusted gross incomes in excess of $200,000 ($250,000 in the case of married individuals filing jointly) and certain estates and trusts are subject to an additional 3.8% tax on their “net investment income,” which generally includes net income from interest, dividends, annuities, royalties, and rents, and net capital gains (other than certain amounts earned from trades or businesses). Corporate U.S. stockholders currently are subject to U.S. federal income tax on net capital gain at the maximum 21% rate also applied to ordinary income.
Noncorporate stockholders with net capital loss for a year (which we define as capital loss in excess of capital gain) generally may deduct up to $3,000 of such losses against their ordinary income each year; any net capital loss of a noncorporate stockholder in excess of $3,000 generally may be carried forward and used in subsequent years as provided in the Code. Corporate stockholders generally may not deduct any net capital loss for a year, but may carry back such losses for three years or carry forward such losses for five years.
When we are not a publicly offered regulated investment company for any taxable year, a non-corporate U.S. shareholder’s pro rata portion of our affected expenses, including our management fees, will be treated as an additional dividend to the shareholder and will be deductible by such shareholder only to the extent permitted under the limitations described below. A “publicly offered regulated investment company” is a regulated investment company whose shares are either (i) continuously offered pursuant to a public offering, (ii) regularly traded on an established securities market or (iii) held by at least 500 persons at all times during the taxable year. For taxable years beginning before 2026, certain expenses (including advisory fees), referred to as miscellaneous itemized deductions generally are not deductible by non-corporate U.S. shareholders, including individuals, trusts, and estates. For taxable years beginning in 2026 or later, miscellaneous itemized deductions generally are deductible by a non-corporate U.S. shareholder (such as an individual, trust or estate) only to the extent that the aggregate of such U.S. shareholder’s miscellaneous itemized deductions exceeds 2% of such U.S. shareholder’s adjusted gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, are not deductible for purposes of the alternative minimum tax and are subject to the overall limitation on itemized deductions under Section 68 of the Code. We do not anticipate that we will initially constitute a publicly offered regulated investment company although it is possible that we may qualify at some point in the future.
We (or the applicable withholding agent) will send to each of our U.S. stockholders, as promptly as possible after the end of each calendar year, a notice reporting the amounts to be included in such U.S. stockholder’s taxable income for such year as ordinary income and as long-term capital gain. In addition, the U.S. federal income tax status of each year’s distributions generally will be reported to the IRS (including the amount of dividends, if any, eligible for the 20% maximum rate). Dividends paid by us generally will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction or the preferential tax rate applicable to qualifying dividends. Distributions may also be subject to additional state, local and foreign taxes depending on a U.S. stockholder’s particular situation.
We (or the applicable withholding agent) may be required to withhold U.S. federal income tax, or backup withholding, from all distributions to any noncorporate U.S. stockholder (1) who fails to furnish us with a correct taxpayer identification number or a certificate that such stockholder is exempt from backup withholding or (2) with respect to whom the IRS notifies us that such stockholder has failed to properly report certain interest and dividend income to the IRS and to respond to notices to that effect. An individual’s taxpayer identification number is his or her social security number. Backup withholding tax is not an additional tax, and any amount withheld may be refunded or credited against the U.S. stockholder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that proper information is timely provided to the IRS.
Under U.S. Treasury regulations, if a stockholder recognizes a loss with respect to shares of our Common Stock of $2 million or more for a noncorporate stockholder or $10 million or more for a corporate stockholder in any single taxable year (or a greater loss over a combination of years), the stockholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement on Internal Revenue Service Form 8886 (or successor form). Direct stockholders of portfolio securities in many cases are excepted from this reporting requirement, but under current guidance, stockholders of a RIC are not excepted. Future guidance may extend the current exception from this reporting requirement to stockholders of most or all RICs. The fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper. Significant monetary penalties apply to a failure to comply with this reporting requirement. States may also have a similar reporting requirement. Stockholders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances. 
Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders 
Whether an investment in the shares is appropriate for a Non-U.S. stockholder will depend upon that person’s particular circumstances. An investment in the shares by a Non-U.S. stockholder may have adverse tax consequences. Non-U.S. stockholders should consult their tax advisers before investing in our Common Stock.
Distributions of our “investment company taxable income” to Non-U.S. stockholders that are not “effectively connected” with a U.S. trade or business carried on by the Non-U.S. stockholder, will generally be subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or lower rate provided by an applicable treaty) to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, unless an applicable exception applies. However, we generally are not required to withhold any amounts with respect to distributions of (i) U.S.-source interest income that would not have been subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax if they had been earned directly by a Non-U.S. stockholder, and (ii) net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses that would not have been subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax if they had been earned directly by a Non-U.S. stockholder, in each case only to the extent that such distributions are properly reported by us as “interest-related dividends” or “short-term capital gain dividends,” as the case may be, and certain other requirements are met. No certainty can be provided that any of our distributions would be reported as eligible for this exception.
Actual or deemed distributions of our net capital gain to a Non-U.S. stockholder, and gains realized by a Non-U.S. stockholder upon the sale of our Common Stock, that are not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business carried on by the Non-U.S. stockholder, will generally not be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax and generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless the Non-U.S. stockholder is a nonresident alien individual and is physically present in the United States for more than 182 days during the taxable year and meets certain other requirements. However, withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% on capital gain of nonresident alien individuals who are physically present in the United States for more than the 182 day period only applies in exceptional cases because any individual present in the United States for more than 182 days during the taxable year is generally treated as a resident for U.S. income tax purposes; in that case, he or she would be subject to U.S. income tax on his or her worldwide income at the graduated rates applicable to U.S. citizens, rather than the 30% U.S. Federal withholding tax.
If we distribute our net capital gain in the form of deemed rather than actual distributions (which we may do in the future), a Non-U.S. stockholder will be entitled to a U.S. federal income tax credit or tax refund equal to the stockholder’s allocable share of the tax we pay on the capital gain deemed to have been distributed. In order to obtain the refund, the Non-U.S. stockholder must obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number and file a U.S. federal income tax return even if the Non-U.S. stockholder would not otherwise be required to obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number or file a U.S. federal income tax return. Accordingly, investment in the shares may not be appropriate for a Non-U.S. stockholder.
Distributions of our “investment company taxable income” and net capital gain (including deemed distributions) to Non-U.S. stockholders, and gains realized by Non-U.S. stockholders upon the sale of our Common Stock that is “effectively connected” with a U.S. trade or business carried on by the Non-U.S. stockholder (or if an income tax treaty applies, attributable to a “permanent establishment” in the United States), will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the graduated rates applicable to U.S. citizens, residents and domestic corporations. Corporate Non-U.S. stockholders may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30% imposed by the Code (or lower rate provided by an applicable treaty). In the case of a non-corporate Non-U.S. stockholder, we may be required to withhold U.S. federal income tax from distributions that are otherwise exempt from withholding tax (or taxable at a reduced rate) unless the Non-U.S. stockholder certifies his or her foreign status under penalties of perjury or otherwise establishes an exemption.
We may have the ability to declare a large portion of a distribution in shares of our Common Stock to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement. If a portion of such dividend is paid in cash (which portion may be as low as 20% under certain public and private rulings issued by the IRS) and certain requirements are met, the entire distribution to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, non-U.S. stockholders will be taxed on the distribution as if the entire distribution was cash distribution, even though most of the distribution was paid in shares of our Common Stock.
The tax consequences to a Non-U.S. stockholder entitled to claim the benefits of an applicable tax treaty may differ from those described herein. Non-U.S. stockholders are advised to consult their own tax advisers with respect to the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in our shares.
A Non-U.S. stockholder who is a nonresident alien individual may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding of U.S. federal income tax on dividends unless the Non-U.S. stockholder provides us or the dividend paying agent with an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or an acceptable substitute form) or otherwise meets documentary evidence requirements for establishing that it is a Non-U.S. stockholder or otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding.
Legislation commonly referred to as the “Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act,” or “FATCA,” generally imposes a 30% withholding tax on payments of certain types of income to foreign financial institutions (“FFIs”) unless such FFIs either (i) enter into an agreement with the U.S. Treasury to report certain required information with respect to accounts held by U.S. persons (or held by foreign entities that have U.S. persons as substantial owners) or (ii) reside in a jurisdiction that has entered into an intergovernmental agreement (“IGA”) with the United States to collect and share such information and are in compliance with the terms of such IGA and any enabling legislation or regulations. The types of income subject to the tax include U.S. source interest and dividends. The information required to be reported includes the identity and taxpayer identification number of each account holder that is a U.S. person and transaction activity within the holder’s account. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, this legislation also imposes a 30% withholding on payments to foreign entities that are not FFIs unless the foreign entity certifies that it does not have a greater than 10% U.S. owner or provides the withholding agent with identifying information on each greater than 10% U.S. owner. Under certain circumstances, a Non-U.S. Stockholder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes.
Non-U.S. persons should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the U.S. federal income tax and withholding tax, and state, local and foreign tax consequences of an investment in the shares.
Failure to Obtain RIC Tax Treatment
If we were unable to obtain tax treatment as a RIC, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would they be required to be made. Distributions would generally be taxable to our stockholders as dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits (in the case of noncorporate U.S. stockholders, at a maximum rate applicable to qualified dividend income of 20%). Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder’s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain.
If we fail to meet the RIC requirements for more than two consecutive years and then seek to re-qualify as a RIC, we would be required to recognize gain to the extent of any unrealized appreciation in our assets unless we made a special election to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on any such unrealized appreciation during the succeeding five-year period.
Possible Legislative or Other Actions Affecting Tax Considerations
Prospective investors should recognize that the present U.S. federal income tax treatment of an investment in our stock may be modified by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time, and that any such action may affect investments and commitments previously made. The rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department, resulting in revisions of regulations and revised interpretations of established concepts as well as statutory changes. Revisions in U.S. federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in our stock.
The discussion set forth herein does not constitute tax advice, and potential investors should consult their own tax advisors concerning the tax considerations relevant to their particular situation.
