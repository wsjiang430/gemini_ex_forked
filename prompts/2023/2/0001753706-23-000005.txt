Item 1.    Business. 
Overview
We are a global food company enabling healthier lifestyles and providing access to high-quality, plant-based sweeteners, flavor enhancers and other foods through our diverse portfolio of trusted brands and delicious products. We operate a proven platform organized into two reportable segments, Branded CPG and Flavors & Ingredients. Our portfolio consists of three main product groups: sweeteners, adjacencies and ingredients.
We were originally formed on August 16, 2018 as Act II Global Acquisition Corp., a Cayman Islands exempted company formed as a blank check company (“Act II”), and consummated our initial public offering (“IPO”) in April 2019. On June 24, 2020, we domesticated into a Delaware corporation and changed our name from “Act II Global Acquisition Corp.” to “Whole Earth Brands, Inc.” On June 25, 2020, we consummated the Business Combination, and in connection therewith, became (i) a successor issuer to Act II by operation of Rule 12g-3(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; and (ii) the ultimate parent of Merisant and MAFCO. Any data presented in this “Business” section with respect to the year ended December 31, 2020, is presented on a combined basis for the Predecessor and Successor periods. See Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We have continued to pursue our growth strategy, and on November 10, 2020, we executed and closed a definitive Equity Purchase Agreement (the “Swerve Purchase Agreement”) with RF Development, LLC (“RF Development”), Swerve, L.L.C. (“Swerve LLC”), and Swerve IP, L.L.C. (“Swerve IP” and together with Swerve LLC, “Swerve”). Swerve is a manufacturer and marketer of a portfolio of zero and reduced sugar, keto-friendly, and plant-based sweeteners and grain free, gluten free, and low/no sugar baking mixes. We purchased all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of both Swerve LLC and Swerve IP from RF Development, and both Swerve LLC and Swerve IP became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Whole Earth Brands. The transaction was structured to simultaneously sign and close, was not subject to any closing conditions, and closed on November 10, 2020.
On December 17, 2020, we entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “Wholesome Purchase Agreement”) with WSO Investments, Inc. (“WSO Investments” and together with its subsidiaries, “Wholesome”), WSO Holdings, LP (“WSO Partnership”), Edwards Billington and Son, Limited (“EBS”), WSO Holdings, LLC (“WSO LLC,” and together with WSO Partnership and EBS, the “WSO Sellers”), and WSO Partnership, in its capacity as representative for the WSO Sellers. WSO Investments is the direct parent of its wholly-owned subsidiary Wholesome Sweeteners, Incorporated, which was formed to import, market, distribute, and sell organic sugars, unrefined specialty sugars, and related products. The transaction closed on February 5, 2021.
Our Business Segments
The table below describes the percentage of our total annual revenue attributable to each of our segments over each of the three years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. For additional financial information relating to our reportable business segments, please refer to Note 18 in our audited consolidated and combined financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“2022 Audited Financial Statements”).

 | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020 | 
Branded CPG | 79 | % | | 79 | % | 64 | %
Flavors & Ingredients | 21 | % | | 21 | % | 36 | %

Branded CPG
Branded CPG, comprised of our Merisant division of operating companies, Wholesome and Swerve, is a global CPG business focused on building a branded portfolio oriented toward serving consumers seeking better-for-you sweeteners across the zero calorie, plant-based, organic, non GMO, and Fair Trade spaces in zero/low calorie sweeteners, honey, agave, baking mix, and baking chocolate segments. Our Branded CPG products are sold under both our flagship brands as well as local and private label brands. Our flagship brands include Whole Earth®, Pure Via®, Wholesome®, Swerve®, Canderel®, Equal® and existing branded adjacencies. Our Branded CPG segment offers a variety of sweetener formulations under each brand to address local consumer preferences and price points. The key ingredients utilized in these products include stevia leaf extract, monk fruit extract, organic sugar, erythritol, xylitol, allulose, aspartame, sucralose and saccharin, all of which are sourced through our global supply chain.
Since the introduction of the original Canderel® and Equal® products in 1979 and 1982, respectively, we have offered consumers high quality alternatives to sugar for daily use. As the global health crisis related to sugar consumption continues to grow, consumers remain focused on finding substitutes for tabletop sugar and sugar-laden products. In recent years, we have met consumer demand by introducing new plant-based sweeteners made from stevia leaf extract, monk fruit extract, allulose and naturally derived sugar alcohols under the Whole Earth®, Swerve® and Pure Via® brands (as well as under the Canderel® and Equal® brands) and introduced low- or no-sugar alternatives to traditionally sugar-laden products such as chocolate, jams, and cereal bars. These initiatives have further established us as a leader in the “better for you” movement away from sugar. Our sweetener products are sold under a variety of forms to satisfy consumers growing usage across diverse consumption occasions. Those forms include sweetener packets, tablets, pouches, jars, and liquid bottles. We distribute our products via the retail, club, food service, and e-commerce channels. 
We have expanded our product offerings in recent years into adjacent consumer packaged goods such as jams and chocolate under our well-known CPG brands. We also invest in innovation to develop new product offerings to distribute under our various brands, providing differentiation from our competitors and exciting new products for customers. In addition, our adjacent branded packaged goods such as jams and chocolate are sold in chocolate bars, dried chocolate powder, and jam jars.
Whole Earth®: Whole Earth® is a global brand of plant-based, zero/low-calorie sweeteners primarily marketed in North America, Australia and New Zealand and sold through a variety of channels including grocery, supermarket, drugstores, mass, club, food-service, and e-commerce. Key Whole Earth® sweetener formulations include ingredients such as stevia leaf extract, monk fruit extract, erythritol, and allulose. 
Pure Via®: Pure Via® is a global brand of plant-based, low-calorie sweeteners that is primarily marketed in Western Europe and North America. Pure Via®-branded products are sold through a variety of channels including grocery, drugstores, mass, club, food-service, and e-commerce. Key Pure Via® sweetener formulations include stevia leaf extract, erythritol and xylitol.
 Wholesome®: Wholesome® is a U.S. leader in organic, fair-trade certified sweeteners, including sugar, honey, agave nectar, molasses, allulose and other natural sweetener products. We acquired this brand in February 2021.
Swerve®: Swerve® is a portfolio of zero and reduced sugar, keto-friendly, and plant-based sweeteners and grain free, gluten free, and low/no sugar baking mixes and is marketed in North America. Swerve® products contain no artificial ingredients, preservatives, flavors, or GMO ingredients. Swerve® sweetener formulations include erythritol, monk fruit, allulose, and reduced sugar blends of sugar and monk fruit; as well as the recently launched no added sugar chocolate baking chips. We acquired this brand in November 2020.
Canderel®: Canderel® is a global brand of low-calorie sweeteners that is primarily marketed in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and, according to AC Nielsen retail data, is the leading sugar-free sweetener in many of its key markets, including France, Belgium, the United Kingdom, and South Africa. Canderel®-branded products are sold through a variety of sales channels including grocery, supermarket, drugstore, mass, club, food-service, and e-commerce. Key Canderel® sweetener formulations include aspartame, sucralose, and stevia leaf extract. 
Equal®: Equal® is a global brand of low-calorie sweeteners that is primarily marketed in North America, Asia Pacific, South Africa and Latin America and, according to AC Nielsen retail data, is the leading sugar-free sweetener in many key markets including Australia, New Zealand and Thailand, and is a top-five sugar-free sweetener in the United States. Equal®-branded products are sold through a variety of sales channels including grocery, supermarket, drugstores, mass, club, food-service, and e-commerce. Key Equal® sweetener formulations include aspartame, saccharin, sucralose, and stevia leaf extract. 
Branded Adjacencies
We also utilize our flagship brands to sell branded products in adjacent packaged food categories. In order to address the growing shift in demand for sugar alternatives, we have introduced new products in the chocolate, jams, cereal bars, and chocolate chip and bake mix categories under our well-known tabletop sweetener brands. These products benefit from strong brand recognition in selected geographies and the ability for customers to easily identify them as low-sugar alternatives when making purchasing decisions. 
Other Brands and Products
In addition to our flagship brands of tabletop sweeteners and branded adjacency products, we also utilize several local brands in specific countries. We believe that these locally-targeted brands have better brand awareness in those countries than our international flagship brands, providing a differentiated product offering in those markets. 
Flavors & Ingredients
Flavors & Ingredients, comprised of our Mafco Worldwide division of operating companies, is a global, business-to-business focused operation with a long history as a trusted supplier of essential, functional ingredients to some of the CPG industry’s largest and most demanding customers. Our products provide a variety of solutions for our customers, including flavoring enhancement, flavor / aftertaste masking, moisturizing, product mouthfeel modification and skin soothing characteristics. Our Flavors & Ingredients segment operates as our licorice-derived products business. 
Founded in 1850, Mafco Worldwide has been the leading global manufacturer and supplier of licorice derivative and extract products, primarily serving beverage, confectionary, cosmetic, food, nutritional, pharmaceutical, personal care and tobacco end markets. Mafco Worldwide’s ability to reliably deliver a consistent, highly customized, superior product has been at the core of its longevity and long-term customer relationships.
As of December 31, 2022, we sell over 200 customer-specific licorice products, consistently meeting taste, chemical, physical, microbiological and regulatory demands, specifications and standards. Our ability to deliver this breadth of products is due to our extensive knowledge and experience with the raw material sourcing and manufacturing processes. This is further supported by our industry-leading supply security and availability, which consists of best-in-class supply chain capabilities, long-standing relationships with key raw material suppliers, and maintenance of substantial raw material reserve inventory around the world.
Our Flavors & Ingredients products are sold across two types of end product: Derivative Products and Extract Products.
Derivative Products are functional ingredients based on a unique compound found only in licorice root, glycyrrhizic acid, which are used in a variety of food, beverage, pharmaceutical, personal care, cosmetic, and nutritional products around the world. In food, beverage and pharmaceutical products, licorice derivatives are used to provide flavor, mask undesirable tastes and extend and intensify sweetness and other flavors. In personal care and cosmetics products, licorice derivatives are used to moisturize, soothe topical skin conditions, and brighten and smooth skin. We sell derivative products both in a line of proprietary compound flavors under the Magnasweet® brand as well as in their pure isolated form. 
Magnasweet® and our latest, Magna-Branded products are our proprietary line of functional taste modulators, which have highly-enhanced characteristics and specific uses compared to the pure derivatives themselves. The backbone ingredient in Magnasweet® and Magna-Branded products are our pure licorice derivatives, as well as proprietary blends of flavoring and other food ingredients. All Magnasweet® and Magna-Branded product ingredients are GRAS (“Generally Recognized As Safe”) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and/or the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association (“FEMA”), and are regulated by the FDA under 21 CFR 184.1408. The base licorice derived component compounds are generally classified as “natural” in Mafco Worldwide’s largest end markets and are also categorized as Non-GMO and Non-Allergenic, thereby they are a “clean label” ingredient.
Extract Products are a concentrated form of the water extracted solids from the raw licorice root which are converted into powder, semi-fluid or blocks, depending on the customer’s requirements and are used in a variety of tobacco, alcohol and confectionary products around the world. In tobacco products, licorice extracts are used as flavor enhancing and moistening agents in the manufacture of American Blend® cigarettes, moist snuff, and chewing and pipe tobacco. In confectionary products, licorice extract is used as flavoring for licorice confections. 
Growth Strategies
Our platform can be leveraged to support new product development, distribution gains in North America, further geographic expansion and to pursue mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”) activity. We will seek to expand our branded products platform through investment opportunities in the natural alternatives and clean label categories across the global consumer products industry. Over time, we will look to become a portfolio of brands that Open a World of Goodness™ to consumers and their families. 
Recent product launches across various geographical markets have been well-received by consumers, and we believe that sales of new products will continue to have a positive impact on revenue going forward. We are able to adapt to changing market conditions, and our management team has identified opportunities for continued research and development, and expansion of product offerings as consumer preferences shift towards natural products. 
We believe that there is a large opportunity for growth in North America and that we have benefited from contacts and relationships, increasing distribution in the natural retailer channel, innovation and reinvestment of cash flow. These efforts are intended to drive retailer support and engagement with club stores and regional grocers to help increase distribution of our new products. 
Additionally, we continue to pursue continued growth in developing economies and gaining entrance into new geographies. Sugar-related health problems are becoming a critical concern to governments and populations in developing economies as diabetes and obesity rates rise. Our management team believes that the need for solutions, together with rising incomes in these geographies, represent macro tailwinds driving local consumers to seek alternatives to sugar. Positive consumption and awareness trends are driving sweetener penetration rates and expanding the category in these countries. Moreover, consumer affinity for developed economy brands such as Equal® and Canderel® position them as premier products. We focus on accelerating brand-building, innovation and marketplace execution in geographies where Equal® and Canderel® are considered premier brands. 
In the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions, adoption of our original products was strong in 2022. In addition, we expect to have significant new opportunities for growth in India and China. We believe that we are under-penetrated in these two large markets and that our management team can help drive increased distribution. 
Furthermore, our management team and board of directors have significant experience in executing and integrating M&A transactions and view targeted tuck-in M&A as a core part of our value creation strategy. Our officers and directors maintain a robust list of potentially actionable acquisition opportunities across end markets to build scale, strengthen market position, enter new geographies globally, and expand into new product verticals. These potential targets cover both the Branded CPG and Flavors & Ingredients segments and include companies in a variety of sizes and geographies. 
Marketing and Distribution Channels
Branded CPG
Recent marketing focus has been on identifying global and local consumer preferences, utilizing research & development (“R&D”) to co-develop a new pipeline of products, and driving brand-building initiatives by leveraging digital, television, and in-store campaigns. In addition to in-house resources, we utilize agencies and experts in the areas of advertising, brand-building, packaging, and in-store promotion / merchandising. 
We distribute Branded CPG products in the United States and internationally through a variety of distribution channels including supermarket, grocery, drugstore, mass, club, food-service, e-commerce, and through distributors and brokers. This distribution strategy enables our products to reach a wide variety of customer types at multiple points of sale and consumption. In addition, we are able to leverage our existing distribution channels and relationships to sell incremental products to those customers.
We sell our CPG products principally across six geographic regions: North America, Europe, India, Middle East and Africa (“IMEA”), Asia Pacific, and Latin America. 
Flavors & Ingredients
All Flavors & Ingredients sales in the United States are made through our offices located in Mount Laurel, New Jersey and Richmond, Virginia, with technical support from our Flavors & Ingredients R&D department. Outside the United States, we sell our Flavors & Ingredients products from our Mount Laurel, New Jersey office, through our French and Chinese subsidiaries and through exclusive agents as well as independent distributors. 
Marketing activity is conducted through our website, digital marketing strategy, tradeshows, R&D newsletters, and email campaigns to effectively reach the individuals who will make purchase to product development decisions at our customers at the R&D, procurement, and the executive levels. 
Suppliers, Raw Materials and Procurement
Branded CPG
The primary raw materials used in our Branded CPG manufacturing processes are stevia leaf extract, monk fruit extract, erythritol, allulose, aspartame, sucralose, saccharin, organic sugar, organic honey, and dextrose. Packaging material used in the manufacturing process includes paper, shipping boxes, glass jars, cartons, stand-up pouches, and plastic bottles. Key ingredients are procured and available on a global scale. These ingredients are contracted forward, with additional supply available in all key markets. 
We believe we maintain excellent relationships with our Branded CPG suppliers and are not reliant on any one vendor for critical supply. 
Flavors & Ingredients
The licorice root used to produce the products sold by our Flavors & Ingredients segment originates in the Middle East and Central Asia in countries such as Afghanistan, the Peoples’ Republic of China, Pakistan, Iraq, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Georgia, Armenia, Russia and Turkey. Our strategy of maintaining strong relationships across multiple markets and suppliers allows us to seamlessly source our licorice raw material requirements in the event supply from any one area or supplier becomes temporarily unavailable or uneconomical. 
We have an exclusive supply contract to purchase the output of licorice extract and certain licorice derivatives from a manufacturer with facilities in Central Asia. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our purchases from this supplier totaled approximately $9.1 million, representing 23.4% of our licorice raw material purchases for the year. In addition to a stable source of licorice raw material, we strive to maintain sufficient licorice raw material inventory and open purchase contracts to meet normal production needs for one or more years to overcome the natural variability in wild collected licorice root quality from various regions and crop cycles and ensure against temporary disruptions in supply.
Our licorice manufacturing and raw material sourcing process is also uniquely flexible in that we are able to use multiple types of commercially available licorice raw material including roots, intermediate licorice extracts and licorice derivatives produced by third parties. This manufacturing and raw material sourcing flexibility enables us to maximize the value of our raw material purchases and inventory investments and to respond quickly to new business opportunities by utilizing intermediate raw material. 
International Operations
We are a global company with sales in over 100 countries, and our principal markets outside the U.S. are in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. Management has identified significant opportunities for increasing the customer base via geographic expansion, distribution gains and product innovation. Our geographic diversity allows us to draw on the skills of a worldwide workforce, provides greater stability to our operations, allows us to drive economies of scale, provides sales streams that may help offset economic trends that are specific to individual economies and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for products. Our management team has strong global relationships with many customers and channels, including grocery, club stores, distributors and food service operators across a number of key geographies that accelerates new product placement and will help us expand our presence in currently under-penetrated markets, such as India and China. In addition, we believe that our future growth depends in part on our ability to continue developing products and sales models that successfully target high-growth markets.
In 2022, we generated approximately 66% of our revenue in North America, approximately 17% of our revenue in Europe, approximately 10% of our revenue in Asia Pacific, approximately 4% of our revenue in IMEA and approximately 3% of our revenue in Latin America. In 2022, one customer accounted for more than 10% of our total sales, representing 14.1% of total sales. One customer accounted for more than 10% of total sales in 2021, but no single customer accounted for more than 10% of total sales in 2020.
The manner in which our products and services are sold outside the U.S. differs by business and by region. Most of our sales in non-U.S. markets are made by our subsidiaries located outside the U.S., though we also sell directly from the U.S. into non-U.S. markets through various representatives and distributors and, in some cases, directly. In countries with low sales volumes, we generally sell through representatives and distributors. 
Information about the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our business is set forth in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” For a discussion of risks related to our non-U.S. operations and foreign currency exchange, please refer to the section entitled “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business.” 
Research & Development
We have dedicated R&D teams employed at each of our reportable business segments. R&D efforts are divided across geographies and focus on a number of areas including new product launches, formulation development, and product expansion opportunities. Our R&D capabilities include supporting existing and potential customers on projects with our products, education on proper use of the products through demonstrations, newsletters, and tradeshows, application development and new product development.
Intellectual Property
Our ability to create, obtain and protect intellectual property (“IP”) is important to the success of our business and our ability to compete. We create IP in our operations globally, and we work to protect and enforce our IP rights. We consider our trademarks valuable assets, including well-known trademarks such as Whole Earth®, Wholesome®, Swerve®, Equal®, Canderel®, Pure Via® and Magnasweet®. 
In addition, we integrate licensed third-party technology and IP into certain aspects of our products. 
Although certain third-party proprietary IP rights are important to our success, we do not believe we are materially dependent on any particular third-party patent, license, or group. 
Competition
We believe that we are a leader in many of our served markets. Although our businesses generally operate in highly competitive markets, our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment, since none of our competitors offer all of the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as we do. Because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors, including well-established regional competitors and competitors who are more specialized than we are in particular markets.
Key competitive factors vary among our businesses and product and service lines, but include the specific factors noted above with respect to each segment and typically also include price, quality, performance, delivery speed, applications expertise, distribution channel access, service and support, technology and innovation, breadth of product, service and brand name recognition. 
We believe that the principal competitive factors in distributing tabletop sweeteners are product taste, consumer brand recognition, ingredient preference, and price. The low-calorie tabletop sweetener market is currently well served at a variety of price points by a number of well-established competitors. We believe that the entrance of a new competitor using existing sweetening ingredients would find it challenging to overcome a highly loyal consumer base, established relationships with worldwide trade and distribution networks, the expense of brand building and lack of product differentiation. As such, we have experienced very little new competition within the alternative sweetener market globally. 
The functional ingredients market typically consists of ingredients that account for a small amount of the customer’s cost of sales, but are vitally important to functionality. Within this market, the principal competitive factors for the licorice category include supply security and availability, product quality, proprietary formulations, price, and technical support. Our Flavors & Ingredients segment is uniquely positioned given its global footprint, best-in-class supply chain capabilities, proprietary manufacturing processes, and regulatory approved customer formulations that reliably provide customers with critical ingredients for their products. Our Flavors & Ingredients segment competes globally for certain derivative products against divisions of larger flavor houses and chemical companies and we compete in local markets with a number of small, private, typically country-focused manufacturers, brokers, and distributors.
Regulation and Compliance
As a food and ingredient manufacturer, we operate in compliance with the requirements of the FDA and other regional food manufacturing guidelines. Our products comply with the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, state unfair competition and deceptive trade practices statutes, Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004, the Organic Foods Production Act, and all comparable state and international laws and each of their applicable implementing regulations. 
Licorice extract and certain pure licorice derivatives used as additives are GRAS for use in food by the FDA. Global approval for the use of licorice extract and derivatives for food consumption varies depending upon the country. Pure licorice derivatives have been successfully utilized in approved pharmaceutical and cosmetics products around the world. Pure licorice derivatives are also approved for use under the EU Cosmetic Directive and by the U.S. Cosmetic Ingredient Review Board. 
Our primary Flavors & Ingredients international manufacturing facilities are currently Global Food Safety Initiative (“GFSI”)-certified and all facilities are registered with the FDA. Each manufacturing facility is monitored using coordinated quality departments located in the U.S., France and China to ensure that all product shipped is in compliance with quality and regulatory requirements. In addition to food manufacturing regulations, we operate in compliance with OSHA requirements and with applicable federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations. Safety training programs are maintained at each facility to educate employees on food safety and workplace safety requirements. 
The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 (“TCA”) gave the FDA comprehensive authority to regulate the manufacturing, marketing and sale of tobacco products in the U.S. The TCA requires tobacco companies to disclose the contents of tobacco products and any changes to their products, and requires FDA review and approval of all new tobacco products. Among its broad powers, the FDA may order changes in cigarettes and other existing tobacco products to meet new product standards based on medical, scientific and other technological evidence as appropriate for the protection of the public health. We work with our tobacco customers to ensure compliance with applicable FDA standards and regulations. 
Human Capital Resources
Whole Earth Brands is a global company, with approximately 760 employees operating in 15 countries. Our employees are engaged in a number of key functions, including operations, sales, R&D and administration.

Total Rewards
In addition to the importance we place on the health, satisfaction and security of our employees and their families, our ability to attract and retain a workforce with the skills critical to our business operations is equally important. We provide a total rewards package that offers valuable and market competitive compensation and benefit plans. These programs reflect our commitment to attracting and retaining top talent, and keeping our employees and their families healthy and secure. Our compensation philosophy is to pay for performance, and we do so through short-term and long-term incentives, all tied to business performance.
Given our diverse employee base with needs that are unique to each individual, we offer benefits that can be selected by each employee to best meet his or her needs. Our benefits vary by region, but generally include medical, dental and vision insurance, retirement savings accounts, disability insurance and other voluntary benefits. We also offer time-off benefits which are equally important to the well-being of our employees including vacation time, sick leave, company paid holidays, and parental leave. We have also introduced a hybrid work model for office based employees to assist with balancing work and personal life.
Environmental, Social and Governance
Our Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) initiatives are intended to enable our business to have a positive impact across product development, ingredient sourcing, manufacturing, and hiring. Our ESG priorities center on three pillars: advance sustainably, support thriving workers and communities, and enable healthier lifestyles. We have developed certain measurable targets in order to guide our ESG efforts with respect to (i) climate; (ii) packaging; (iii) waste and water; (iv) responsible sourcing; (v) diversity, equity and inclusion; (vi) innovation and transparency; and (vii) equitable access.
