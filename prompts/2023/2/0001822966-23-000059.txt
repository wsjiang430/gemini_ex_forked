Overview
NuScale is redefining nuclear power through the development of proprietary and innovative SMR technology that will deliver safe, scalable, cost-effective and reliable carbon-free power. Our core technology, the NPM, can generate 77 MWe and is premised on well-established nuclear technology principles, with a focus on the integration of components, simplification or elimination of systems and use of passive safety features. We believe this results in a safe and highly reliable power plant, suitable to be sited close to where electricity or process heat is needed. Our flagship VOYGRTM power plant is a scalable plant design that can accommodate up to 12 NPMs, resulting in a total gross output of 924 MWe. NuScale expects the first VOYGR power plant to be operational in 2029.
Since 2007, we and the DOE have invested over $1.4 billion toward the development of our NPM and VOYGRTM power plant technology and we have been issued 469 patents globally, with an additional 186 patent applications currently pending. In September 2020, our 12-module VOYGR-12TM design (currently approved for 160 million watts of thermal power (“MWt”) or 50 MWe per NPM) became the first and only SMR to receive a U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Standard Design Approval (SDA) from the NRC. The NRC’s final rulemaking approving NuScale’s design certification was effective in February 2023. The approval was a critical milestone that allows customers to move forward with plans to develop VOYGR power plants, knowing that safety aspects of the NuScale design are NRC-approved. In December 2022, we applied for an SDA for an increase in NPM power from 50 MWe to 77 MWe (160 MWt to 250 MWt) per module, which we expect to receive in 2024. We expect to be ready to deliver modules to customers by 2028.
Our unique SMR has several key defining characteristics, including:
•Proven. Our NPM technology leverages existing light water nuclear reactor technology and fuel supply that have been operating globally for over 60 years.
•Simple. NuScale’s simple NPM design, based on natural circulation, integrates the reactor core, steam generators and pressurizer in a single factory-built vessel and eliminates the need for reactor coolant circulating pumps, large bore piping and other components found in conventional large-scale nuclear reactors. This simplicity improves safety and reduces capital and operational costs.
•Scalable. In addition to our flagship 12-module (924 MWe) VOYGR-12 power plant, we offer smaller power plant solutions including the six-module (462 MWe) VOYGR-6TM and the four-module (308 MWe) VOYGR-4TM. These VOYGR power plants can commence operation with one module and scale to house up to their approved capacity of twelve, six or four modules. This scalability will allow customers to right-size their up-front capital investment and economically increase installed capacity over time through the addition of NPMs.
•Safe. VOYGR power plants have been designed to be the safest in the world and have several industry-first advantages over conventional large-scale nuclear plants, including an unlimited “coping” period during which the NPMs can be shut down and kept in a safe condition without operator intervention, AC or DC power or any additional cooling water. As a result, we have numerous operational and commercial advantages including a safety case that supports a small, site-boundary emergency planning zone (“EPZ”) designation by the NRC, as well as various resiliency and reliability features including the ability to start and operate a plant without AC or DC power to provide first-responder power.
In addition to the sale of NPMs and our VOYGR power plant designs, we will offer a diversified suite of services throughout the development and operating life of the power plant. Our suite of services includes licensing support, testing, training, fuel supply services and program management, among others. We anticipate that our service offering will have high penetration rates across our customer base and will provide consistent, recurring revenues throughout the life of the VOYGR power plant. We expect service revenue to begin approximately eight years prior to a power plant’s commercial operation date and to extend throughout the life of the power plant.
Our potential customers are a mix of domestic and international governments, political subdivisions, utilities, state-owned enterprises and industrial companies in need of carbon-free, reliable energy. Our first contract to deploy a VOYGR power plant is with UAMPS. UAMPS is expected to deploy a six-module (462 MWe) VOYGR-6 power plant as part of its CFPP located at the Idaho National Laboratory near Idaho Falls, Idaho. Construction at the CFPP is expected to begin in 2025 and the plant is expected to be operational in 2029. Additionally, in November 2021, we signed a teaming agreement with 
S.N. Nuclearelectrica to advance the delivery of our technology in Romania as early as 2029. In total, our sales pipeline currently includes over 120 active customer opportunities and 17 signed Memoranda of Understanding (“MOUs”) globally.
To date, the DOE has granted NuScale four separate cost-share awards totaling more than $656 million, including most recently, $350 million as part of a 5-year, $700 million 50/50 cost-share award granted in 2020. We also benefit from a global network of strategic investors and supply chain partners that we expect will play an integral role in bringing NuScale’s technology to market around the world. Fluor, a leading global engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”) firm, is the majority stockholder in NuScale and collaborates with NuScale on plant standard design and the provision of EPC services to NuScale’s customers. Other strategic investors and supply chain partners include Doosan; Sargent & Lundy, LLC; Sarens; JGC; IHI; GS Energy Corporation; and Samsung C&T, among others.
Merger Transaction
On December 13, 2021, Spring Valley, NuScale LLC and Merger Sub entered into the Merger Agreement. On May 2, 2022, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged into NuScale LLC (the “Merger”) with NuScale LLC surviving, Spring Valley was renamed NuScale Power Corporation, and NuScale LLC continued to be held as a wholly controlled subsidiary of NuScale Corp in an “Up-C” structure (collectively, the “Transaction”). As a result of the Transaction, NuScale Corp holds all of the NuScale LLC Class A units (which are the sole voting interests at the NuScale LLC level) and Legacy NuScale Equityholders hold NuScale LLC Class B units (which are non-voting) and shares of NuScale Corp Class B common stock (which entitle the Legacy NuScale Equityholder to vote at the NuScale Corp level but which carry no economic rights). At specified times, in NuScale Corp’s discretion, Legacy NuScale Equityholders may exchange NuScale LLC Class B units (together with cancellation of an equal number of shares of NuScale Corp Class B common stock) for NuScale Corp Class A common stock.
The Transaction was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization as provided under GAAP, with NuScale Corp treated as the acquired company and NuScale LLC treated as the acquirer. This determination reflects that Legacy NuScale Equityholders hold a majority of the voting power of NuScale Corp, that NuScale LLC’s pre-Merger operations constitute the majority post-merger operations of NuScale Corp, and that NuScale LLC’s management team retained similar roles at NuScale Corp.
Industry
According to BloombergNEF’s New Energy Outlook 2021 “Red Scenario” (“NEO 2021”), which includes SMR capacity as part of the pathway to global net-zero carbon emissions, global power consumption is expected to increase 191% between 2020 and 2040, requiring approximately 22,000 gigawatts (“GW”) of additional generating capacity. Today, the energy and power markets are undergoing dramatic changes as they shift from fossil fuels to carbon-free sources. A series of technological, economic, regulatory, social and investor pressures are leading the drive to decarbonize electricity and other sectors, such as transportation (electric vehicles) and buildings (electric heating). As such, the majority of required global capacity additions, including the replacement of existing carbon-intensive power generation, is expected to come from carbon-free generation.
Technology Improvements. Technology advancements will continue to have a tremendous influence on world energy mix in the future. According to the BloombergNEF, solar photovoltaic (“PV”) capacity has grown 37% annually since 2000 and now accounts for approximately 10% of global power generation capacity. A primary reason for this growth has been technological advances throughout the solar value chain, resulting in an approximate 96% decline in PV module prices from $4.90 to $0.20 per watt over that same period, according to International Energy Agency. We believe that technological improvements in SMRs and other carbon-free generation sources will catalyze similar adoption trends going forward.
Economic and Reliability Requirements. Utilities are looking to deploy carbon-free power generation technologies due to a variety of economic and reliability drivers. Renewables, such as wind and solar, now have a levelized cost of electricity similar to that of many traditional forms of power and have become a focal point in the push to deploy carbon-free generation. However, renewables alone are not a practical solution for regional power grids and baseload generation is required to solve for factors such as intermittency, transmission constraints and land use limitations. In these cases, we believe that nuclear, and specifically SMRs, are the only viable carbon-free baseload power solution that can address the global need for carbon-free generation.
Regulatory Mandates and Government Funding. On December 8, 2021, President Biden signed an executive order mandating all electricity procured by the government be 100% carbon pollution-free by 2030, including at least 50% from around-the-clock dispatchable generation sources. The order also requires that federally owned buildings produce no net emissions by 2045 and that each federal agency achieve 100% zero-emission vehicle acquisitions by 2035. Additionally, on November 15, 2021, the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was signed into law that includes $65 billion in funding for power and grid investments. This includes investments in grid reliability and resiliency as well as clean energy technologies such as carbon capture, hydrogen and advanced nuclear, including SMRs.
Internationally, more than 190 countries and the European Union have signed the Paris Agreement, which seeks to keep the rise in mean global temperature to below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Currently, more than 130 countries, including China and the United States – the countries with the first and second largest CO2 emissions globally – have now set, or are considering setting, a target of reducing net emissions to zero by mid-century.
Social and Environmental Preferences. The effects of climate change, including extreme weather events and rising temperature, and the resulting health and socio-economic stability of at-risk populations, have led to a societal focus on the environment. As a result, a global shift is occurring in societal preferences for a reduction in greenhouse gases and a move towards carbon-free power.
Investor Pressures. ESG investing has accelerated as institutional investors shift their portfolios away from carbon‐intensive assets. According to a recent study by the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance, in 2020 approximately 36% of global assets under management are “sustainable investments” that consider ESG factors. This shift in investor sentiment has caused many large integrated energy companies, such as BP plc and Royal Dutch Shell plc, to set decarbonization strategies and diversify into different forms of carbon-free energy.
Our Market Opportunity
According to the NEO 2021, approximately 16,000 GW of carbon-free generation capacity additions are required globally through 2040 to meet domestic and international climate goals. These additions are a result of the growth in projected power use and the replacement of existing carbon-intensive generation, primarily from coal, oil and natural gas.
Although critical in helping meet climate goals, renewables, such as solar and wind, and hydroelectric are constrained due to intermittency, seasonality and issues associated with land use and grid interconnections. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average 2020 capacity factor (the ratio of actual power output over generation capacity) for solar, wind and hydro was 24.2%, 35.3%, and 40.7%, respectively, compared to 92.4% for nuclear. In most regions globally, flexible and dispatchable sources, such as long-duration storage, geothermal, gas, coal with carbon capture and nuclear will be essential. Among these sources, SMRs represent an attractive option based on their near-term viability, competitive costs, carbon-free emissions and reliability.
Market Opportunity and the Role of SMRs
SMRs are small nuclear reactors designed with scalable technology using module factory fabrication that pursue economies of series production and short construction times. The four primary technologies currently being pursued in SMRs are water-cooled reactors, fast neutron reactors, high temperature gas reactors and molten salt reactors. Light water reactors, such as our NPM, are considered by the World Nuclear Association to have the lowest technological risk and are the most developed from a commercial perspective benefiting from decades of proven technology.
SMRs have a number of inherent advantages over traditional large-scale nuclear and other carbon-free power generation, including:
•Simplicity of Design. Large scale nuclear plants, which typically generate 1 GW or more, are complex in terms of design and construction. SMRs are simpler to manufacture, construct, operate and maintain. SMRs are also designed to eliminate many of the nuclear components needed in large-scale plants which adds to their simplicity.
•Enhanced Safety Features. Although our NPM is the only SMR with an NRC-approved safety case, according to the DOE, “small modular reactors have the potential for enhanced safety and security compared to earlier designs.” The smaller reactor core and reduced potential for off-site release from SMRs means SMRs may be located closer to population centers and industrial facilities needing process heat. The robust design, small fuel inventory, and multiple barriers preventing fission product release contribute to a low probability and consequence of radionuclide release, even under extreme upset conditions, thus simplifying the emergency preparedness and response and providing a basis for reducing the EPZ. NuScale is the only company to obtain approval of its EPZ methodology from the NRC (or any 
other national government nuclear regulatory body) and NuScale is the only SMR developer to have an approved regulatory basis for obtaining a site boundary EPZ.
•Economics versus Traditional Nuclear. Traditional large-scale nuclear facilities have high upfront capital costs due to the size of the power plants as well as long construction times. These plants require significant resource planning and utilities have hesitated to deploy the capital necessary to build large-scale nuclear plants because of these high costs. SMRs are simpler, smaller and the reactors are largely factory built, leading to shorter construction times and greater cost predictability. 
•Modular and Scalable. SMRs can more easily match customer needs and avoid surplus capacity. Modularity results in splitting power plant development between the factory and the field, reducing the schedule risk that has impacted large reactor construction projects. The NuScale modular design has the benefit to customers of being right-sizable upon construction and scalable over time.
•Smaller Footprint. According to information published by E3 Consulting, we estimate that our SMR uses up to 99% less land per MWh compared to wind and solar projects. We expect this resource efficiency will also extend to construction materials, such as steel, cement, concrete and glass: according to a 2015 DOE study, nuclear power generators required 90% less construction material on a tons per terawatt-hour basis than wind and solar upstream collection systems and generators. Furthermore, SMRs can be sited closer to the end-user, significantly reducing the need for transmission infrastructure while also providing ancillary benefits such as process heat to end users.
Our Technology
Our NPM is the product of approximately 16 years of research and development by NuScale and key collaborators, including Oregon State University and the Idaho National Laboratory. Over $1.4 billion (including non-dilutive DOE grants) has been invested to date and the technology is protected by 655 issued and pending patents globally.
A NuScale power plant is composed of multiple NPMs. Each NPM is capable of producing 77 MWe. The NPM consists of an integral reactor composed of the reactor core, helical coil steam generators and pressurizer within the reactor pressure vessel, enclosed in a steel containment vessel. The reactor core consists of an array of fuel assemblies and control rod clusters at standard enrichments. The helical coil steam generator consists of two independent sets of tube bundles with separate feedwater inlet and steam outlet lines. The integral reactor measures 65 feet tall and 9 feet in diameter. The containment vessel measures 76 feet tall and 15 feet in diameter and is much smaller and stronger than the concrete containment shells for large reactors. The NPM operates inside a stainless-steel lined water-filled pool located below ground level.
Our NPM technology leverages existing light water nuclear reactor technology and fuel that has been operating globally for over 60 years. The reactor operates using the principles of buoyancy-driven natural circulation; hence, no pumps are needed to circulate water through the reactor. Once the heated water reaches the top of the riser, it turns downward into an annulus where the hot water flows over the steam generator tubes. Water in the reactor system is kept separate from the 
water inside the steam generator to prevent contamination. As the hot water in the reactor system passes over the hundreds of tubes in the steam generator, heat is transferred through the tube walls and the water inside the tubes turns to superheated steam. This innovative design eliminates the need for reactor coolant pumps, large bore piping, complex safety systems and other components found in conventional large-scale nuclear reactors. The result is a simplified system that improves safety and reduces capital and operational costs.
Design Features and Innovations
Our NPM introduces a number of key design innovations that allows us to be the safest and most reliable provider of nuclear energy. Our design features include:
•Proven Technology. Our NPM design relies on well-established pressurized, light water reactor technology. As such, a VOYGR power plant can be licensed within the existing regulatory framework for light water reactors, drawing on a vast body of established research and development, proven codes and methods and existing regulatory standards. Because our technology was designed on the basis of this proven foundation, we believe NuScale has a significant advantage over other alternative and yet unproven nuclear technologies that may come to market, both with respect to obtaining regulatory approvals and attracting customer interest. NuScale received NRC Standard Design Approval for its 12-NPM, 50 MWe design in September 2020 and design certification in February 2023. NuScale has applied for NRC Standard Design Approval for its 6-NPM, 77 MWe design.
•Single, Integrated Unit. The NPM incorporates all of the components for steam generation and heat exchange into a single integrated unit. This design eliminates all large bore interconnection piping, which is historically a potential source of failure and cause of construction complexity for large-scale reactors.
•Compact Size. Each NPM, including the containment vessel, can be entirely fabricated in a factory and shipped by rail, truck, or barge to the power plant site for assembly and installation. Fabrication of the modules in a factory environment reduces fabrication cost, improves quality, reduces construction time and increases schedule predictability. This is a distinct benefit compared to traditional large-scale nuclear plants in which reactors are built on-site and only after their completion can the balance of the plant be constructed. We can fabricate our NPMs in parallel with VOYGR power plant construction, saving time and reducing complexity, labor and construction costs.
•Natural Circulation. The reactor core of our NPM is cooled entirely by natural circulation of water. Natural circulation provides a significant advantage in that it reduces capital and operational costs by eliminating reactor coolant pumps, pipes and valves and the associated power, maintenance and potential failures of those components. 
•Refueling and Maintenance Innovations. Each NPM can produce power continuously for approximately 20 months before refueling is required. Because of the multi-module design of VOYGR power plants, each NPM can be refueled in a staggered manner, reducing total plant output by only 77 MWe for approximately 10 days. This significantly reduces the cost of replacement power compared to large-scale nuclear plants (typically 1,000 MWe) that must shut down their entire capacity for any outage. Whereas large-scale nuclear plants can require as many as 1,000 or more individuals for refueling and associated outage activities, a VOYGR power plant can undergo the same refueling and outage activities with a much smaller, permanent, in-house crew of as few as 50 individuals. 
•Multi-Module Control Room. NuScale has designed, and received NRC approval for, an innovative control room that can control up to 12 NPMs with only three licensed operators. This compares with traditional large-scale nuclear plants that require a minimum six licensed operators for three reactors. This innovation is enabled by NuScale’s proprietary platform called the Highly Integrated Protection System (“HIPS”). The HIPS platform provides a robust safety platform to monitor NPMs and protect VOYGR power plants from potential cybersecurity attacks.
Safety Case
NuScale’s design innovations have allowed for a number of industry-first and best-in-class safety attributes.
•Unlimited “coping period”. Our NPMs are designed with fully passive safety systems and are kept safe in a cooling condition for an unlimited time following any extreme event that renders a power plant without external power. During the span of such an event and for an unlimited time, the VOYGR power plant does not require any internal or external human or computer actions, AC or DC power or additional water to cool the reactors (referred to as NuScale’s Triple Crown For Nuclear Plant Safety). An unlimited coping period is unprecedented for commercial light water nuclear reactors. Historically, commercial light water nuclear reactors have maximum coping periods of 72 hours before operator action is required to keep the reactor safe.
•Support for Site Boundary EPZ. NuScale’s VOYGR power plants have been designed to allow an NRC-approved EPZ that does not extend beyond the power plant site boundary (the restricted area controlled by the plant owner). The NRC has approved NuScale’s methodology for calculating EPZ size. This methodology, approved solely for 
NuScale’s unique passively safe design, demonstrates that most NuScale plant sites in the U.S. can be approved with a 300-yard “site-boundary” EPZ. Currently operating commercial nuclear power plants in the U.S. are required to have a 10-mile radius EPZ from the reactor site and the population within the EPZ must be capable of evacuating within a specified time period. The smaller EPZ enables VOYGR power plants to be sited closer to end-users, which is of particular importance to process heat off-takers and to owners seeking to repower retiring coal-fired generation facilities. 
•No Requirement for Backup Power. The NRC concluded that NuScale’s safety design eliminates the need for “Class 1E” power – i.e., safety-related, backup power. This means that VOYGR power plants do not need costly emergency diesel generators to ensure the safety of the reactors in the event of a power loss. Today, no operating nuclear plant in the United States can make this claim. 
•Resilience to Man-made and Natural Events. The VOYGR reactor building is designed to withstand the impact from man-made and natural events, including floods, earthquakes (in excess of the Fukushima event), tornados and hurricanes in excess of 280 mph winds, and the impact of a large commercial airplane. The VOYGR power plant is also designed to safely shut down following an electromagnetic pulse or geomagnetic disturbance.
Technology-Enabled Operational Features
NuScale’s design innovations and best-in-class safety case create a number of technology-enabled operational features that no other carbon-free generation source can claim. These features address a host of critical industry needs with respect to grid resiliency and reliability and provide customers with related commercial benefits that other power generation solutions do not provide. Select features of NuScale’s VOYGR power plants include:
•No Requirement for connection to the grid. The VOYGR plant is the only commercial nuclear power plant approved by the NRC without requiring any connections to the transmission grid for safety. This allows off-grid operation such that NuScale plants can be sited in the proximity of industries needing electricity and process heat. It also enables a NuScale plant to replace a coal fired power station located at the end of a single transmission line. 
•First Responder Power. When the transmission grid is lost, traditional large-scale nuclear power plants automatically and rapidly shutdown. Large-scale nuclear power plants are not capable of restarting, nor are they permitted to do so, until the transmission grid is restored because power from the grid (supplied by two off-site sources) is required to power the safety systems and operate the equipment necessary to start the power plant. The VOYGR power plant would remain at power, ready to immediately sell electricity to the grid when the grid is back online, making it a first responder to the restoration of the transmission grid. 
•Black-Start Capability. A VOYGR power plant can start up from cold conditions without external grid connections. This NuScale design capability is a first-of-a-kind for the nuclear industry. 
•Island Mode Power. A single NPM can supply all the “house load” electricity needs of the plant while also continuing to provide power to a local industrial customer or mission critical facility without external grid connection via a micro-grid connection. 
•Highly Reliable Power. VOYGR-12 power plants will be able to provide 154 MWe of power to mission critical facilities with 99.95% availability over the 60-year life of the plant. In the event of a catastrophic loss of offsite grid and disruption of transportation infrastructure, a VOYGR-12 will be able to provide up to 120 MWe to a mission critical facility micro-grid for at least four years without refueling.
Design Validation and Testing
NuScale’s safety design has been validated through rigorous testing of critical components, such as fuel assemblies, control rod and control rod mechanisms and the integral helical coil steam generators. NuScale has constructed an electrically-heated, one-third scale, full-pressure and temperature integral thermal-hydraulic test facility that demonstrates the operation of the entire nuclear steam supply system and safety systems.
In addition, we have proven the ability to safely operate 12 NPMs from a single control room by building and operating a full-scale simulated control room. Through comprehensive testing in this simulator, NuScale has shown that the demands on the reactor operators are significantly reduced compared with traditional large reactors, as a result of the simplicity of the design, advancements in digital controls, and the fact that NuScale’s design requires no operator-initiated safety functions for all design basis events. Through comprehensive analyses, demonstrations and audits, the NRC has approved NuScale’s conduct of operation such that three licensed operators can safely operate a VOYGR-12 plant without the need for a Shift Technical Advisor, a key safety-related role required by the NRC for all existing large-scale nuclear plants.
Products and Services
NuScale has determined that it currently operates in a single segment and will periodically reassess that determination as it nears commercialization and deployment of its NPMs.
NuScale Power Modules and NuScale VOYGR Power Plants
NuScale currently offers VOYGR power plant designs for three facility sizes that are scalable in that they are capable of housing from one to four, six or twelve NPMs. For each of these plant configurations, the total facility gross electric output can be as much as 308 MWe, 462 MWe or 924 MWe, respectively, based on a nameplate capacity of each NPM of 77 MWe. This scalability allows customers to right-size their up-front capital investment and economically increase installed capacity over time through the addition of NPMs as needed.
A customer seeking to deploy a VOYGR power plant will be granted a license from NuScale to construct, operate, maintain and decommission the VOYGR plant. NuScale will also provide design and nuclear regulatory licensing basis information necessary for the customer to obtain regulatory approval to construct and operate the power plant. In exchange for this license, the customer will pay an upfront technology licensing fee to NuScale.
Sale of NuScale Power Modules. In addition to the customer paid technology license, NuScale also expects to sell to the customer major nuclear engineered equipment. For the VOYGR power plant, this will consist of the NPMs, the reactor building crane, module assembly equipment and other equipment associated with the nuclear steam supply system and nuclear fuel handling.  NuScale expects to provide the manufacturing and delivery of modules to the customers’ VOYGR power plant site on a contracted basis. NuScale also expects to receive payment related to the fabrication of the NPMs 
coincident with the order of materials and commencement of manufacturing so that no working capital will be required from NuScale for work-in-progress or finished inventory.
The VOYGR-12, VOYGR-6 and VOYGR-4 can each commence operation with as few as one module and scale to house as many as twelve, six or four modules, respectively. This scalability allows customers to right-size their up-front capital investment and economically increase installed capacity over time through the addition of NPMs as needed.
Services
We will also offer customers a diversified suite of services throughout the life of the power plant, beginning approximately eight years prior to a plant’s commercial operation date. Pre- and post-operation date service offerings provide customers with critical services related to the licensing, design, development, constructing, operation and maintenance of the VOYGR power plant. As a first mover and developer of the power plant’s nuclear technology, we believe we are well positioned to be a trusted service provider. As such, we anticipate our services will have high penetration rates and will provide consistent, recurring revenues that could become significant once a large number of VOYGR plants are in operation.
Our services include:
•regulatory licensing support, including in the United States preparation and prosecution support for the customer’s desired regulatory approval regimes under either 10 CFR, Part 50 or Part 52 pursuant to U.S. NRC regulations;
•start-up testing and commissioning support;
•training to support initial and ongoing power plant operations;
•management of all aspects of the U.S. NRC required inspections, tests, analysis and acceptance criteria process;
•NPM mechanical handling;
•initial and ongoing fuel bundle loading and movement;
•design engineering management during commercial operation;
•operations and maintenance program management, including regulatory compliance reporting support;
•procurement and spare parts management;
•nuclear fuel management including reload analysis;
•outage planning and execution support; and
•system verification and validation for safety and non-safety systems.
Competitive Strengths
Only Viable Carbon-free Baseload Power. Nuclear is the only viable carbon-free baseload power available to address the global need for carbon-free generation and to meet decarbonization targets year-round. Traditional baseload technologies, such as gas and coal, are carbon intensive; traditional nuclear is costly, complex and frequently subject to cost-overruns; and hydroelectric power is dependent on geography, rainfall, curtailment and other factors. Renewables such as wind and solar are intermittent and weather dependent, and batteries have not been scaled to make these viable baseload power sources. SMRs such as NuScale’s VOYGR power plants provide highly reliable, cost-effective, carbon-free baseload power to electric grids – no other existing baseload technology can claim the same benefits on the scale needed to address the world’s growing needs.
Innovative Technology Platform and Intellectual Property Portfolio. We have 469 patents issued and an additional 186 patents pending. These 655 patents protect key aspects of our technology, and we continue to grow our intellectual property portfolio. In addition, we have a highly educated workforce of 556 employees, of whom 248 have master’s degrees in engineering and science and 29 have Ph.Ds. We believe our intellectual property rights, as well as our highly skilled personnel are important assets necessary to maintain our competitive advantage in the market and expand on our technology platform.
First to Receive an SDA from the NRC. Although China and Russia have currently operating SMRs, ours is the first and only SMR to receive a Standard Design Approval (SDA) from the NRC. This is an important regulatory milestone that provides customers with certainty – knowing that the NRC approves of the plant design – before committing significant capital to develop a nuclear facility. The SDA process took NuScale 41 months to complete – including preparation, application and receipt of approval. This was the fastest any nuclear reactor company has ever received approval from the NRC. To date, no SMR or advanced reactor company other than NuScale has even applied to the NRC for SMR design approval. We believe that this, and the fact that our design approval timeline was based on well-established light water nuclear technology, provides NuScale with a solid competitive advantage over other SMR competitors.
Unparalleled Safety Case. NuScale’s innovative, fully passive safety system design addresses the historical concerns of traditional large-scale nuclear power plants. In the event of a total loss of power to the facility, a VOYGR power plant does 
not require any operator or computer actions, grid connection or emergency backup power or additional water to cool the reactors and can remain safe indefinitely. All large-scale nuclear reactors require one or all three of these within a period of days. The rigorously tested safety case results in an array of applications and commercial opportunities for NuScale that traditional nuclear power plants cannot support, and VOYGR power plants can be located closer to end-users and population centers.
Global Network of Strategic Investors and Supply Chain Partners with DOE Support. We have developed a global network of blue-chip supply chain partners, many of which are investors in NuScale. We believe these partners will play a critical role in the successful procurement and fabrication of components, manufacture of our NPMs and fuel supply. In addition, we have also received significant financial and regulatory support from the DOE since the inception of NuScale. No other SMR or advanced nuclear technology has received the level of awards or grants (combined, among us and our customers) that the NuScale design has, and we maintain a strong relationship with the DOE.
Cost-Competitive. We are cost-competitive in the United States, where the prevailing wholesale cost of baseload electricity is relatively low, and we are even more competitive globally where the baseload cost of electricity is typically higher. However, when customers decide on a generation technology, headline cost is not the only consideration. Our technology’s reliability, resiliency and flexibility are key attributes both customers and regulators value that are not captured in LCOE. We believe our competitive cost coupled with our differentiated capabilities gives us an advantage to other technologies.
Visionary Management Team. We have an experienced and passionate team of leaders and innovators who have developed the technology over the years and run the operations of the business today. Our management team has an average of over 8 years at NuScale (founded 16 years ago) and 35 years of commercial and energy industry experience. Our executives have extensive prior management experience in nuclear and engineering organizations, such as the NRC, United States Navy, DOE, General Electric Company, Exelon Corporation, Framatome, Babcock & Wilcox Company, LLC and others.

Competition
Our competitors are other power generation technologies, including traditional baseload, renewables, long duration storage and other nuclear reactors, including SMRs. We believe our competitive strengths differentiate us from our competition globally, in part because NuScale’s SMR technology is currently the only NRC-approved SMR technology capable of meeting the growing demand for carbon-free baseload generation.
Traditional Baseload. According to BloombergNEF, approximately 62% of global generation capacity in 2020 was natural gas, coal, oil and large-scale nuclear. These technologies are highly reliable, cost-effective, dispatchable and land use efficient. However, with the exception of traditional large-scale nuclear, these resources are carbon-intensive and we expect them to largely be replaced with carbon-free generation over time. Traditional large-scale nuclear power plants, while carbon-free, require significant upfront capital expenditures, have a history of extensive construction times, complex safety systems and do not have business cases apart from utility-scale generation. We believe our carbon-free SMR technology contains all of the positive attributes of traditional baseload and addresses many of the flaws of traditional nuclear power plants.
Renewables. According to BloombergNEF, approximately 38% of global generation capacity in 2020 was wind, solar, hydroelectric and other renewable power generation sources. Although these sources generate carbon-free power, wind and solar are highly intermittent and non-dispatchable, and hydroelectric is seasonal and subject to curtailment. Additionally, since renewables are weather-dependent, they are too unreliable to support certain end-use cases, including mission-critical applications or industrial applications that require extensive on-site, always-available power. Due to their innovative design NuScale VOYGR plants can operate as baseload generation, load-follow renewables and/or support key industrial applications.
Other Advanced Nuclear Reactors. There are several reactor technologies that are in various stages of development, such as high temperature gas-cooled reactors, fast reactors, molten salt reactors, fusion technologies and others, and commercial SMRs are currently operating in China and Russia. These technologies, like ours, are designed to be clean, safe and highly 
reliable. However, these technologies have not received regulatory approval in the United States, and many of the technologies have not been demonstrated and do not have fuel supply infrastructure in existence. Currently, we have the only SMR that has received a Standard Design Approval from the NRC, and no other SMR company or customer has even applied for approval. Achieving Standard Design Approval is a regulatory process that took us over $500 million to prepare and 41 months and over $200 million to complete.
Customers
NuScale’s potential customers include governments, political subdivisions, state-owned enterprises, investor-owned utilities and other commercial and industrial companies, both in domestic and international markets. Our end-markets can be broken down into two general subsets: baseload generation and industrial applications. Baseload generation includes repurposing coal-fired facilities to nuclear or new clean baseload capacity. Many industrial customers require significant energy needs such as chemical plants, direct air capture facilities, hydrogen production facilities, oil refineries, metal smelters and water desalination plants. Our technology can provide the necessary reliable electricity and heat energy to these facilities in an environmentally efficient manner.
Today we have a pipeline of over 120 customer opportunities globally which range from customer leads to a contracted customer. We currently have two contracts in place with UAMPS and RoPower that have stated commercial operation dates in 2029-2030. We also currently have 17 MOUs in place with both utility and industrial customers across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. MOUs are an important step toward advancing to a definitive contracted customer and we believe many of these MOUs will convert into signed contracts over time. In December 2022, we completed our Standard Plant Design (“SPD”), which provides potential customers with a generic VOYGR power plant design that will serve as a starting point for deploying site-specific designs, including supporting client licensing and deployment activities. Prospective customers in the United States are gaining an understanding of the potential benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which provides production tax credits for existing nuclear power plants but, more importantly, for new nuclear power plants and specifically for advanced reactors and small modular reactors. International customers seeking to decarbonize and meet climate change goals are increasingly looking at NuScale Plants as their means to meet energy needs and carbon-reduction goals.
UAMPS. UAMPS is our first customer. UAMPS is a political subdivision of the State of Utah that provides energy services to public power systems in six western states. UAMPS plans to deploy a NuScale VOYGR-6 power plant for its CFPP located at the Idaho National Laboratory near Idaho Falls, Idaho. The DOE issued a Site Use Permit to UAMPS for the CFPP in February 2016, and the final site was selected in July 2019. In October 2020, the DOE approved a $1.4 billion multi-year cost share award to UAMPS' wholly owned subsidiary, CFPP LLC, to fund the development and construction of the CFPP. In 2020, UAMPS started site characterization activities necessary for licensing and construction for the CFPP site. The anticipated commercial operation date for the plant, based on UAMPS schedule, is 2029. We are currently under contract to provide various services to CFPP including support of license applications, startup and testing, initial training and initial fuel services. Additional details regarding, and risks associated with, our arrangements with UAMPS is described in “Risk Factors—Commercialization Risk Factors—We may be unable to charge UAMPS, our first customer, for some costs we have incurred and we may be required to reimburse UAMPS if we fail to achieve specified performance measures.”
RoPower/SNN. On November 4, 2021, NuScale and Nuclearelectrica, a national energy company in Romania that produces electricity, heat and nuclear fuel, signed a teaming agreement to advance the delivery of NuScale’s SMR technology, then expected to be as early as 2027. NuScale and RoPower Nuclear S.A. (RoPower), owned in equal shares by S.N. Nuclearelectrica S.A. and Nova Power & Gas S.A., announced on January 4, 2023, that a contract for Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) work was signed between parties on December 28, 2022, marking a significant step toward the deployment of a NuScale VOYGR small modular reactor (SMR) power plant in Romania by 2029.
Other Potential Customers. We have signed non-binding MOUs with 17 potential customers around the world, including in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Potential customers with which we have publicly announced MOUs include Bruce Power, CEZ Group, Grant County PUD, Shearwater Energy, Prodigy Clean Energy Ltd., Energoatom, Kazakhstan Nuclear Power Plant and Kozloduy NPP – New Build Plc.
Growth Strategy
We intend to grow our business by leveraging our competitive advantages in scalability, safety, reliability and cost. We have a number of avenues to achieve our growth objectives:
Traditional and New Applications. We believe the market for NuScale VOYGR power plants is wherever non-intermittent, reliable, carbon-free power is needed. Initially, we are focused on replacing carbon intensive coal-fired power plants and as an alternative to new-build gas-fired generation. Additionally, we are focused on marketing VOYGR power plants to industrial and micro-grid customers in sectors that include direct air capture, water desalinization, hydrogen production and mission critical facilities.
International Customer Development. We continue to develop our international customer base as we foresee a majority of our customer demand over the long-term to be outside of the United States. Our team puts significant effort into developing dialogue with foreign governments and corporations in order to educate and market our technology. The 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference and other global climate events have generated significant inbound interest from potential global customers. We will continue to strengthen relations with these parties to accelerate sales globally. In our sales pipeline we have identified more than 45 potential customers with interest in exploring nuclear power for their baseload needs.
Technology Advancements. Using our innovative technology platform and robust intellectual property portfolio, NuScale is well-positioned to continue making technology advancements over time. These improvements include increasing power output, simplifying operations, reducing construction time and reducing production cost. Just as we increased power to 77 MWe per module without increasing module size or construction costs, our R&D team is continuously researching and developing ways to improve our technology and meet our customers’ energy needs – creating top line growth opportunities and potential for additional margin capture by NuScale over time.
Development of New Products. We continue to explore the development of innovative new products based on our core NPM technology. For example, we are developing a micro-reactor for niche end-markets. Our micro-reactor design is a 0.01 MWe to 10 MWe module intended to supply power to remote, off-grid and small communities. Use applications could include mining, universities, space power, military installations and disaster relief. These micro-reactors are expected to be small, compact, highly reliable, fully automated and rapidly deployable.
Supply Chain
We have an established global supply chain ecosystem for all NPM components and for the construction of VOYGR power plants. We also have strategic and commercial partnerships in place globally that allow us to outsource the manufacturing of key NPM components, including the upper and lower reactor pressure vessels (riser and core internals), the steam generator and the upper and lower containment vessels.
We are working with suppliers, such as Doosan Enerbility; Precision Custom Components; Sarens; Curtiss-Wright Corporation; and IHI, among others, who we expect to build components of NPMs to our specifications. Other key suppliers include Framatome, SA (fuel assemblies), Honeywell International Inc. (control systems), Paragon Energy Solutions (protection systems), Sensia LLC (sensors and instrumentation) and PaR Systems, Inc. (reactor building crane).

Nuclear Safety Regulation
The commercial nuclear industry is heavily regulated in all countries, and regulatory approval is required for the design, construction and operation of every nuclear plant. Generally, nuclear safety regulators consider (1) design safety and robustness against internal hazards (e.g., component failures and fires) and external hazards (e.g., earthquakes and weather loads such as snow, rain and wind), and (2) environmental impacts of construction and operations (e.g., water use and preservation of historical sites and animal and plant species). Regulation must be addressed on a country-by-country basis, although regulators often collaborate when a design is deployed in multiple countries.
Our licensing strategy has two goals: (1) obtain approval in the shortest possible time by engaging the regulator early and developing high quality applications; and (2) maintain a common design of the NPM in as many markets as possible by leveraging the highly regarded NRC Standard Design Approval during each regulatory approval process.
Nuclear Safety Regulatory Approval in the United States
We submitted a Design Certification Application (“DCA”) in December 2016 to the NRC, comprising 12,000 pages, with approximately 2,000,000 pages of additional documentation and 100 gigabytes of test data. Development of the DCA required approximately $500 million in testing and engineering. Approval by the NRC included over 250,000 review hours at a cost of approximately $70 million. In addition to paying the NRC review fees, we incurred approximately $130 million in costs responding to numerous NRC requests for additional information, analyses and audits. Despite the intensity of the review, the NRC approved the NuScale design in 42 months—the fastest approval ever completed by the agency. We received the SDA for our 50 MWe NPM and VOYGR-12 plant design in August 2020, and our SMR design is currently the only SMR with such an approval. The NRC subsequently certified the design as Appendix G to Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 52. No other SMR or non-light water nuclear vendor has applied to the NRC for a nuclear power reactor SDA.
We expect to obtain additional NRC approval of plant configurations desired by customers. For example, we have seen strong customer interest in the VOYGR-6. We completed an SDA application for this configuration at the end of 2022. The SDA application is currently under an acceptance review by NRC and we expect that the acceptance review should be complete by mid-March 2023. The NRC review will focus its review of the SDA application on differences from the NRC-certified design. We expect NRC review time for the SDA reflecting the new configuration will be 24 months. 
Customers that use our design incorporate an SDA into their license applications. The license application review can begin before the SDA application is approved. The NRC does not re-review the design in the SDA during the license application review; the review is limited to site specific design features (e.g., physical security systems, water intake structures), operational programs (e.g., maintenance, emergency preparedness) and environmental impacts. The ability to incorporate an SDA and provide only site specific information to file a license application is an improved licensing process developed by the NRC and industry, and has been used by all new reactor designs and license applications since the early 1990s. This process, known as Part 52, substantially reduced regulatory and financial risk for license applicants compared to the older process, known as Part 50. As the only vendor using Part 52 to date, NuScale has a competitive advantage and makes our SMR attractive to potential customers.
Nuclear Safety Regulatory Approval Internationally
Generally speaking, most countries limit license applications to the proposed owner and/or operator of nuclear power plants. Where appropriate in support of a customer or at the request of the regulator, we intend to engage early with regulators in each country of interest, consistent with our approach in the U.S.
The NRC has bilateral relationships with many other countries and participates in several international support organizations, including the International Atomic Energy Agency (“IAEA”), the Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Nuclear Regulators Association. We expect NRC approval will benefit our ability to obtain regulatory approvals internationally and will give foreign regulators confidence that the NuScale design is safe. We also expect to benefit from the NRC’s regulatory assistance program, through which the NRC collaborates with other countries’ regulators to understand the basis for the NRC approval of our design.
NuScale is also engaging directly with the IAEA to facilitate regulatory approval abroad. The IAEA, while not a regulator, is important because many countries’ regulatory frameworks were developed from IAEA standards, which are somewhat different from the NRC framework. We plan to initiate in 2023 a Technical Safety Review of Design Safety (TSR-D5) with the IAEA. The purpose of a TSR-DS is to review the design safety of a nuclear power plant against the IAEA safety standards. The TSR-DS will evaluate the NuScale VOYGR-6 design information along with three supplemental reports against the IAEA safety requirements. The purpose of the review is to identify strengths and potential weaknesses of the safety case to expedite licensing in countries that employ IAEA safety guidelines.
In addition, we have had significant interaction with safety regulators and energy ministries in many of the countries where there is significant customer interest. For example: we have worked through material parts of the Vendor Design Review process with the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission; we have completed a technology assessment conducted by the Office of Nuclear Regulation in the U.K.; we are working through a licensing gap analysis (comparing select local, IAEA and Western European Nuclear Regulators’ Association requirements against the NuScale design) with the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate in Ukraine; and we have performed analysis of NuScale plant safety, economy and maneuverability under a study funded by Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.
Other Regulation
In addition to nuclear safety regulation, NuScale is subject to other nuclear regulatory controls such as export control, nuclear material safeguards and non-proliferation restrictions and liability insurance regimes (e.g., Price-Andersen Act, the 1960 Paris Convention, the 1963 Vienna Convention, and the 1997 Convention on Supplementary Compensation). NuScale plans to sell its plants only in jurisdictions where nuclear liability is exclusively channeled to the plant operator.
Customers purchasing NuScale plants also must obtain required permits, licenses and insurance for the jurisdiction where the facility will be located. In the U.S., a NuScale plant developer must obtain an NRC construction permit and an NRC operating license issued pursuant to 10 CFR Part 50 or a combined license issued pursuant to 10 CFR Part 52. Other U.S. federal permits or licenses for a NuScale plant may include a Section 404 Dredge & Fill Permit issued by the Army Corp. of Engineers; a Federal Aviation Administration § 77.15 Permit; a Certificate of Registration issued by the U.S. Department of Transportation; and a Spills Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan mandated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. State or local regulators may also require permits or licenses for a NuScale plant, including a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit for Storm Water Discharges from Construction Activities and to Construct a Sanitary Wastewater, Wastewater Treatment facility; Section 401 Water Quality Certification; Well Permits; Solid Waste Handling Permit; and appropriate building permits.
Export Controls
NuScale’s business is subject to, and complies with, stringent U.S. import and export control laws, including the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) from the Bureau of Industry and Security which is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, and regulations issued by the DOE. The regulations exist to advance the national security and foreign policy interests of the U.S. and to further its nonproliferation policies. Nuclear technology, also known as technical data, is controlled by 10 CFR Part 810, under the regulations of the DOE. Nuclear hardware and codes specifically designed or modified for use in a nuclear reactor are controlled by the NRC under 10 CFR Part 110.
The U.S. government agencies responsible for administering the EAR and other export control regulations have a degree of discretion interpreting and enforcing these regulations. These agencies also have significant discretion in approving, denying or instituting specific conditions regarding authorizations to engage in controlled activities. Such decisions are influenced by the U.S. government’s commitments to multilateral export control regimes, particularly the Nuclear Suppliers Group, a group of nuclear supplier countries that seek to prevent nuclear proliferation by controlling the export of materials, equipment and technology that can be used to manufacture nuclear weapons.
Many different types of internal controls and measures are required to ensure compliance with such export control regulations. For example, 10 CFR Part 810, Appendix A provides a list of countries that are considered Generally Authorized meaning they are considered to be non-sensitive. Countries not on this list are required to be specifically authorized prior to sharing any nuclear technology. Under Part 110, the NRC regulates the export or import of nuclear hardware, material and code, following the same sensitive countries vs. non sensitive countries regulatory structure embedded in 10 CFR Part 810.
