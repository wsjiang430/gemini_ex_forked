Item 1. Business.
Overview
The Vita Coco Company is a leading platform for brands in the functional beverage category. We pioneered packaged coconut water in 2004 and have extended our business into other healthy hydration categories. Our mission is to deliver great tasting, natural and nutritious products that we believe are better for consumers and better for the world. We are one of the largest brands globally in the coconut and other plant waters category, and one of the largest suppliers of Private Label coconut water. 
Our branded portfolio is led by our Vita Coco brand, which is the leader in the coconut water category in the United States, and also includes coconut oil, juice, hydration mix and milk offerings. Our other brands include Runa, a plant-based energy drink inspired from the guayusa plant native to Ecuador, Ever & Ever, a sustainably packaged water, and PWR LIFT, a protein-infused fitness drink. We also supply Private Label products to key retailers in both the coconut water and coconut oil categories. 
We source our coconut water from a diversified global network of 14 factories across six countries supported by thousands of coconut farmers. As we do not own any of these factories, our supply chain is a fixed asset-lite model designed to better react to changes in the market or consumer preferences. We also work with co-packers in America and Europe to support local packaging and repacking of our products and to better service our customers’ needs.
Vita Coco is available in over 30 countries, with our primary markets in North America, the United Kingdom, and China. Our primary markets for Private Label are North America and Europe. Our products are distributed primarily through club, food, drug, mass, convenience, e-commerce, and foodservice channels. We are also available in a variety of on-premise locations such as corporate offices, fitness clubs, airports, and educational institutions.
History
The Vita Coco Company, Inc., formerly known as All Market Inc., was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in January 2007 and incorporated in Delaware as a public benefit corporation in April 2021. We completed an initial public offering (the "IPO") of our common stock in October 2021.
Industry
We operate in the functional beverages industry. Our primary brand Vita Coco Coconut Water competes in the approximately $2.7 billion global coconut and plant waters category, as estimated by Euromonitor (2022).  Our Runa brand competes in the plant based energy beverage category, our Vita Coco coconut milk product is a plant-based dairy alternative and our PWR LIFT brand competes in the enhanced isotonic category. We also develop and sell other brands in the beverage category, and occasionally in other categories, as we test our ideas for expanding our product portfolio. The beverage industry, and specifically the functional beverage categories, are significantly larger than the coconut and plant waters category and provide opportunities for potential growth. 
We believe per capita consumption of natural beverages is growing as a result of increasing consumer interest in plant-based alternatives and preferences for health-conscious products that have fewer added sugars and artificial ingredients, while providing more nutritional benefits. In addition, we believe that consumer awareness of the negative environmental and social impact of packaged goods has resulted in increased consumer demand for brands that are purpose-driven, take responsibility for their impact on the planet and are focused on sustainable packaging and transparent ethical values. We believe our mission is aligned with the growing demands generated by this consumer behavior. 
Competition
The beverage industry is highly competitive and is constantly evolving in response to ever-changing consumer preferences. Competition is generally based on brand recognition, taste, quality, price, availability, selection and convenience, as well as factors related to corporate responsibility and sustainability.
Additionally, we compete within the broad non-alcoholic beverage category, and our flagship brand, Vita Coco, is the market leader in the coconut water category in the United States. Our competitors in the beverage market include large beverage companies such as The Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, Inc. and Nestlé S.A. that may have substantially greater financial resources and stronger brand recognition than we have. We also compete with other leading functional beverages 
including Goya, Harmless Harvest, Foco, BodyArmor, Monster Energy, Red Bull, Bang, Ocean Spray and Bai, as well as a range of emerging brands and retailers’ own private label beverage brands. Our competition and competitors vary by market due to regional brands and taste preferences.
We are also a leading supplier of Private Label coconut water and oil brands, and we compete with other Private Label suppliers for that business.
Business Operations
As of December 31, 2022, we operate in two business segments: (i) the Americas segment, comprised of our operations primarily in the United States and Canada and (ii) the International segment, comprised of operations primarily in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia Pacific regions. While over 91% of our business is based on sales of coconut water, we have used our access to market to add other beverage brands with a view to building a diversified beverage platform of compatible brands. 
Vita Coco
With the launch of the Vita Coco brand in New York City in 2004, we established coconut water as a premium lifestyle drink in America. Vita Coco is the coconut water category leader with approximately 50% market share in the United States according to IRI U.S. for the 52 weeks ending December 25, 2022, which over indexes to younger households and to more multicultural shoppers. 
We offer Vita Coco coconut water as an alternative to sugar-packed sports drinks and other less healthy hydration alternatives. Vita Coco has evolved from a primarily pure coconut water brand to a full portfolio of coconut-based products. The portfolio now includes multiple offerings in the coconut water category with Vita Coco Pressed, Vita Coco Coconut Juice, and Farmers Organic, with offerings in adjacent plant-based categories such as Vita Coco Coconut MLK, Vita Coco Barista, Vita Coco Coconut Oil, and Vita Coco Hydration Drink Mix. 
In 2022, we focused on expanding our multipack strategy in coconut water to increase consumption with core consumers. In addition, we expanded our Farmers Organic product to national distribution and focused on the regional rollout of Vita Coco Coconut Juice. In 2023, we intend to continue to develop these initiatives, while in parallel expanding into new occasions through a licensing collaboration with Diageo. Vita Coco Spiked with Captain Morgan is a ready-to-drink cocktail sold by Diageo and made with their flagship Captain Morgan rum and our flagship Vita Coco coconut water that will be distributed nationally in 2023. 
Internationally, our business is anchored by Vita Coco’s presence in the United Kingdom, where it is the chilled coconut water category leader with 82% market share, according to IRI UK, for 52 weeks ended December 31, 2022. Our United Kingdom commercial team and our supply chain based in Asia have allowed us to sell into other European and Asian countries. Vita Coco coconut water has a presence in key markets such as China, France, Spain, the Benelux region, the Nordic Region, Africa and the Middle East.
Private Label
We expanded into Private Label coconut water in 2016 as a way to develop stronger ties with select, strategic retail partners and improve our operating scale. Our coconut water Private Label offering increases the scale and efficiency of our coconut water supply chain, and also provides us with a share of the value segment, without diluting our own brand. We also supply retailers with Private Label coconut oil.
Runa
Runa is a plant-based, natural offering for consumers in the energy drink market. We believe that Runa’s clean energy drinks provide consumers with a refreshing energy boost without the jolts and jitters, and with less sugar, than traditional energy beverages. A key ingredient in Runa is guayusa, an Amazonian jungle plant which we believe is a "super-leaf." 
Ever & Ever
Launched in 2019, Ever & Ever is a purified water brand packaged solely in aluminum bottles. Given emerging consumer concerns with the disposal or recyclability of plastic water bottles, we created Ever & Ever to respond to the consumer need for a sustainably packaged water product in aluminum bottles with potential infinite re-cyclability. Ever & Ever was launched with a focus on the foodservice and office channels. Ever & Ever is also available in our Direct-to-Consumer ("DTC") channels.
PWR LIFT
In 2021, we launched PWR LIFT, a beverage targeted at post-workout and recovery hydration occasions with added nutritional benefits. PWR LIFT is a protein-infused sports drink with electrolytes and zero sugar, designed to provide fitness-minded consumers with protein in a hydrating beverage.  In 2022, we tested PWR LIFT in select markets including Arizona, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia and, in 2023, we plan to expand the offering to Texas. The brand targets fitness enthusiasts and consumers seeking healthier beverage options, and we plan to grow the brand by focusing on premium retail execution, brand sponsorships, influencer partnerships and social media advertising.
Supply Chain
We engage contract manufacturers, co-packers and third-party logistics providers to manufacture and distribute our products. Our fixed asset-lite model enhances production flexibility and capacity, and enables us to focus on our core in-house capabilities which include supplier management, logistics, sales and marketing, brand management and customer service. Our well-diversified global manufacturing network spans across six countries, 14 coconut water factories operated by our manufacturing partners and five co-packing facilities for products not packaged near source. Our network provides us with significant production capacity and capabilities, and an ability to re-allocate coconut water sourcing in the event of supply chain issues, weather, logistics or other macroeconomic impacts. 
Coconut water needs to be transferred from the coconut into an aseptic package within hours of cutting a coconut from the tree. Our supply chain partners are positioned as close to the coconut growing regions as possible to keep quality at the highest level. Through our access and relationships with coconut processors and manufacturers in many countries, including the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Brazil, we have built up a unique body of knowledge and relationships that promote coconut water processing at scale, as well as gained access to farms across diversified geographies. We also attempt to foster a thriving loyal farming community around our manufacturing partners through our work with charitable organizations to support agricultural education programs and investments in schooling. This community outreach has strengthened our long-term manufacturing relationships and we believe will support our capacity needs for future growth. 
Raw materials used in our business and by our co-packers consist of ingredients and packaging materials purchased from local, regional and international suppliers. The principal ingredients include coconut water, Tetra Paks and caps, cardboard cartons, PET bottles and aluminum bottles and cans. We work with our contract manufacturing partners to purchase our raw ingredients from local suppliers in accordance with rigorous standards to assure responsible sourcing, quality and safety. The majority of our products are produced and packaged with materials sourced from a single supplier, Tetra Pak, whether purchased by us or by our contract manufacturers on our behalf, which provides us efficiency in the packaging and export of our products, and furthers our commitment to responsible sourcing, packaging near source and sustainability. Our production contracts are mostly denominated in United States dollars, with some limited contracts in local currencies such as the Brazil Real.
Distribution, Sales and Marketing 
Our beverages and other products are sold in club stores, supermarkets, convenience stores, drug stores and e-commerce websites as well as other outlets. Our products are typically shipped directly from our contract manufacturing partners to a network of third-party warehouses located in our selling markets. We go to market in North America through various distribution channels, including a Direct Store Delivery distribution network ("DSD"), Direct-to-Warehouse network (DTW), broadline distributors, and our own DTC channel. We match the customers' needs with the right route to market providing us flexibility for our established brands and for our innovations. Outside of North America, we use a combination of DTW, importers and distributors depending on the needs of the market.
Our European market is primarily retail and e-commerce operator direct sales, with some countries supported by distributor or importer type relationships. In China, we sell to Reignwood Investment (China) Co., Ltd, which is our import and distributor partner for the territory, and, through its affiliates, has been one of our significant shareholders since 2014. Other countries are serviced through importers with limited retail direct relationships or in partnership with one of our manufacturing partners through licensing or other agreements.
We employ a dedicated global sales and commercial team. In the Americas, the sales team focuses on three main areas: (i) DSD management, (ii) national account management (including club, mass food and convenience) and (iii) retail execution. Our European sales team is aligned geographically and by major account or by import partner and is further supported by a small field execution and marketing team in the United Kingdom. Private Label accounts are handled by each geographic division in close cooperation with supply chain leadership. Our sales and marketing function in China is handled by our importer.
We also employ a brand, marketing, e-commerce and insights team with strong creative, social and digital capabilities with a primary focus on the North American and European markets. The primary goal of our marketing function is to educate consumers about the functional benefits of our products while inspiring consumers to fall in love with our brands. Since the early days, our brands have been sponsored by a roster of celebrity and athlete fans. Today, we continue to leverage relationships with talent and influencers who are aligned with our values and are genuine fans of our brands. 
Seasonality
As is typical in the beverage industry, sales of our beverages are seasonal, with the highest sales volumes generally occurring in the second and third fiscal quarters during the warmer months of the year in our major markets.
COVID-19
Over the past few years, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused general business disruption worldwide. Since the beginning of this pandemic in January 2020, our top priority has been the health, safety and well-being of our employees. Although our workforce has returned to the office on a hybrid basis, some of the impacts on our business created by the COVID-19 pandemic have continued or evolved. 
After COVID-19 emerged, among other impacts, we saw significant changes to global ocean shipping availability and pricing of containers, lengthening transit times, increased domestic transportation costs and some payroll inflationary effects. We also experienced negative impacts on our inventory availability and delivery capacity and temporary manufacturing and distribution partner shutdowns which affected, at times, our ability to fully service our customers’ demand. We took measures to bolster key aspects of our supply chain and we continue to work with our supply chain partners to ensure our ability to service customers and their demand. Some of these supply chain and logistics impacts have lessened over time, but conditions have not returned to those existing before the COVID-19 pandemic. In some cases, new challenges have emerged. For example, towards the end of 2022 into 2023, although the pricing and availability of shipping containers has improved, the cost of warehouse space in the United States used to store inventory has increased significantly over recent months while availability of such warehouse space has decreased. 
We continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and developments related thereto on our business. For additional discussion of the factors above and the impact of COVID-19, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Product Innovation
We engage in research and development activities and invest in innovation globally with the goal of creating products using natural, functional ingredients. We have years of expertise working with plant-based ingredients to deliver products to meet the needs of our customers. We balance our innovation priorities between adding functionality and taste to existing brands and researching and developing new products and brands for new occasions, need states or specific retailer opportunities.
Our global innovation function sits in the marketing team to ensure alignment with current brand initiatives and sharing of consumer insights across teams and markets. The innovation team works closely with our internal global research and development and technical teams that include employees in the United States, Europe and Singapore focused on supplier capability, quality improvements and new processes. We also have strong supplier relationships that give us access to a broad scope of ingredients, packaging offerings and technologies. 
Intellectual Property
We own domestic and international trademarks and other proprietary rights that are important to our business. We view our primary trademark to be VITA COCO. We have a global approach to protecting our trademarks, designs, patents and other intellectual property rights. We believe the protection of our trademarks, designs, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets are important to our success. 
As of December 31, 2022, we had over 30 registered trademarks, over 10 pending trademark applications in the United States, over 230 registered trademarks and over 20 pending trademark applications in other countries. Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. 
We consider information related to formulas, processes, know-how and methods used in our production and manufacturing as proprietary and endeavor to maintain them as trade secrets. We have in place reasonable measures to keep the above-mentioned items, as well as our business and marketing plans, customer lists and contracts reasonably protected.
Government Regulation
Our products are regulated in the United States as conventional foods. We, along with our distributors, and manufacturing and co-packing partners, are subject to extensive laws and regulations in the United States by federal, state and local government authorities including, among others, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration and similar state and local agencies. Among other things, the facilities in which our products and ingredients are manufactured must register with the FDA, comply with current good manufacturing practices and other standard requirements applicable to the production and distribution of conventional food products. We and our manufacturing and co-packing partners are also subject to similar requirements in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate.  These types of requirements include: product standards; product safety, product safety reporting; marketing, sales, and distribution; packaging and labeling requirements; nutritional and health claims; advertising and promotion; import and export restrictions; and tariff regulations, duties, and tax requirements.
Products that do not comply with applicable governmental or third-party regulations and standards may be considered adulterated or misbranded and subject, but not limited to, warning or untitled letters, product withdrawals or recalls, product seizures, relabeling or repackaging, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, import holds, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. In addition, some of our products are produced and marketed under contract as part of special certification programs such as organic, kosher or non-GMO, and must comply with the strict standards of federal, state and third-party certifying organizations. 
Public Benefit Corporation Status and Corporate Social Responsibility
We operate as a Delaware public benefit corporation, and, therefore, our operational decision-making goes beyond solely maximizing shareholder value. Our public benefit purpose, as provided in our certificate of incorporation, is harnessing, while protecting, nature’s resources for the betterment of the world and its habitants by creating ethical, sustainable, better-for-you beverages and consumer products that not only uplift our communities, but that do right by our planet. Furthermore, in order to advance the best interests of those materially affected by the corporation’s conduct, it is intended that our business and operations create a material positive impact on society, taken as a whole.
In March 2022, The Vita Coco Company, Inc. announced it was designated as a Certified B Corporation, a certification reserved for businesses that balance profit and purpose to meet the highest verified standards of social and environmental performance, public transparency and legal accountability. Through achieving Certified B Corporation status, The Vita Coco Company, Inc. joined its subsidiary, All Market Europe Ltd, a United Kingdom company, which had previously achieved B Corporation status. 
We believe that we bring our products to market through a responsibly designed supply chain, and provide our farmers and manufacturers the partnership, investment, and training they need to not only reduce waste and environmental impact, but also bring income and opportunity to their local communities. In 2014, we created the Vita Coco Project to support and empower our coconut farming communities by encouraging innovative farming practices, improving education resources, and scaling our business to promote economic prosperity. With our “Give, Grow, Guide” philosophy we seek to contribute to educational programs and facilities by supporting initiatives to build new classrooms and fund scholarships, with a goal to impact the lives of people in these communities. Additionally, we attempt to partner with other third-party organizations that share and advance our ideals, including fair trade, accessible nutrition and wellness, and environmental responsibility.
We believe this purpose-driven approach has aided our growth as it is strategically aligned with the beliefs of our global consumer base and has improved our supplier relationships.
Since 2022, we have published an annual Impact Report to evaluate and communicate the environmental and social impacts of our business. As a public benefit corporation, we are required by Delaware law to provide a biennial statement on our promotion of the public benefits identified in our certificate of incorporation and of the best interests of those materially affected by the corporation's conduct. We intend to use the Impact Report to be issued later this year as such biennial statement. 
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we had 269 full-time employees. Of these employees, 202 were employed in the United States. None of these employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have never experienced a labor-related work stoppage.
Our people are at the heart of our business. Our Board of Directors provides oversight of the policies and procedures in place that relate to talent, leadership and culture, and compensation plans for our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee evaluates and approves the compensation plans related to our executive officers. In 2022, we received a Great Place to Work Certification from the Great Place to Work Institute based on the ratings of our employees. We believe that we have been able to attract diverse and highly engaged employees who share our belief in our mission and further promote our inclusive company culture. To monitor the health of our human capital resources, we track turnover, perform exit interviews, conduct periodic employee surveys, hold quarterly town halls with open question and answer sessions, and conduct performance reviews and build development plans to assist each employee achieve their potential. Based on exit interviews and employee surveys, we identify opportunities for improvement in our processes and track our employee engagement levels. At the time of our IPO and again in the first quarter of 2023, we awarded all full-time global employees an equity grant with vesting based on continued employment in order to motivate retention and align our employees with our other shareholders. 
We promote and value a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture for our employees. In 2020, our employees formed a Diversity and Inclusivity Committee which has worked to celebrate all our employees, educate and recommend improvements to our processes to enhance our organization and our culture. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 47% of our employees identified as female, 51% identified as male, and 1% did not disclose their gender identity. In addition, at the end of 2022, 40% of our employees identified as Black, Indigenous and/or People of Color or two or more races, 52% identified as white, and 8% did not disclose their race. We strive to reflect the diverse identities and cultures of our consumers.
