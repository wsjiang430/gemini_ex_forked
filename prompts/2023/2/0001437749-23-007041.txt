Item 1. Business
General
 Nortech Systems, Inc., (“the Company”, “we”, “our”) organized in December 1990, is a provider of design and manufacturing solutions for complex electromedical devices, electromechanical systems, assemblies and components headquartered in Maple Grove, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis, Minnesota. We maintain facilities and operations in Minnesota in the United States; Monterrey, Mexico; and Suzhou, China. We offer a full range of value-added engineering, technical and manufacturing services and support including project management, designing, testing, prototyping, manufacturing, supply chain management and post-market services. Our manufacturing and engineering services include complete medical devices, printed circuit board assemblies, wire and cable assemblies, and complex higher-level electromechanical assemblies. The majority of our revenue is derived from products built to the customer's design specifications.
 
Our breadth of manufacturing, technical expertise and experience make us attractive to our broad customer base. Our customers are original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) in the Medical, Aerospace and Defense and Industrial markets. The diversity in the markets we serve is an advantage in dealing with the effects of fluctuations from the economy and competition. In the design phase, we provide technical support, subject matter expertise in design for manufacturing and testing capabilities that allow our customer programs to get to production faster while meeting both their quality and cost requirements. Our customers rely on our experience and capabilities in manufacturing and supply chain to manage and reduce cost over the life cycle of their products. This requires a strong relationship with our customers based on a trusting partnership as we perform as an extension of their operations.
 
All of our facilities are certified to one or more of the industry standards, including International Standards Organization (“ISO”) 9001, ISO 13485, and Aerospace Systems (“AS”) 9100, with most having additional certifications based on the needs of the customers they serve. In addition to industry standard certifications we actively manage quality metrics throughout product life-cycle at all levels of the organization to provide real-time, pro-active support to our customers and their projects. Process validation is performed through the strict phases of installation qualification, operation qualification and performance qualification.
 
Business Segment
 The Company operates in the Medical, Aerospace & Defense and Industrial markets with over 50% of its revenue coming from medical device and product manufacturing and related engineering services. All of our operations fall under the Contract Manufacturing segment within the Electronic Manufacturing Services (“EMS”) industry. We strategically direct production between our various manufacturing facilities based on a number of considerations to best meet our customers’ needs. We share resources for sales, marketing, engineering, supply chain, information services, human resources, payroll, and all corporate accounting functions. Our financial information is evaluated regularly on a consolidated basis by the chief operating decision maker in assessing performance and allocating resources.

Business Strategy
 The EMS industry has evolved into a dynamic, high-tech, regulated global electronics contract services industry. We continue to expand our capabilities and footprint to better meet these changing market requirements. Along with offering technical expertise in our quality processes, engineering design applications and testing, we are also increasing our focus on supplier-managed inventory services and the cost drivers throughout the global supply chain. We continue to transform our business model from one that is less transactional and price/commodity driven to a solution based model focused on value added services. We continue to pursue strategic opportunities that may include acquisitions, mergers, and/or joint ventures with complementary companies to expand our service offering, advance our competitive edge, grow our customer base and increase revenues. Our strategic objectives and our history have been based on both organic and acquired growth.
 
Our quality systems and processes are based on ISO standards with all facilities certified to ISO 9001 and/or AS9100 standards. We also have ISO 13485 certification which recognizes our quality management systems applicable to contract design, manufacture and repair of assemblies for the medical industry. Our Milaca operation is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) registered facility. These certifications and registrations provide our customers assurance of our capabilities and proven processes.
 
We are committed to quality, cost effectiveness and responsiveness to customer requirements. To achieve these objectives we have invested in Restriction of Hazardous Substances (lead free) processing, equipment, plant capacity studies, people, enterprise resource planning systems, lean manufacturing and supply chain management techniques at our facilities. We are committed to continuous improvement and have invested in training our people to identify and act on improvement opportunities. We maintain a diversified customer base and expand into other capabilities and services when there is a fit with our core competencies and strategic vision.
 
Marketing
 We concentrate our marketing efforts in the Medical, Aerospace & Defense and Industrial markets. Our marketing strategy emphasizes our breadth, expertise and experience in each of our markets. Our expertise helps our customers save time and money and also reduces their risks. The breadth of our manufacturing, supply chain, engineering services and complete turnkey solutions assist our customers in getting their products to market quickly while managing the total cost solution. Our strength is managing low to moderate volume components and assemblies with high mix customer demand. This requires us to have close customer relationships and operational flexibility to manage the variation of product demands.
 
Our customer emphasis continues to be on companies that require an electronic manufacturing partner with a high degree of manufacturing and quality sophistication, including statistical process control, statistical quality control, ISO standards, Military Specifications, AS9100 and FDA facility registration. We continue efforts to penetrate our existing customer base and expand market opportunities with participation in industry forums and selected trade shows. We target customers who value proven manufacturing performance, design, project management and application engineering expertise and who value the flexibility to manage the supply chain of a high mix of products and services. We market our services through a mix of traditional marketing outreach, a specialized business development team and independent manufacturers' representatives.

Sources and Availability of Materials
 We currently purchase the majority of our electronic components globally and directly from electronic component manufacturers and large electronic distributors. In 2021 and into 2022, we, like many other companies in our industries, experienced significant supply chain and shipping disruptions. We attempt to overcome these disruptions through advanced supply chain solutions we develop in partnership with our customers, a commitment to strong supplier partnerships and risk management tools.
 
Major Customers
 Our largest customer accounted for approximately 26.9% of net sales in each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
 
Patents and Licenses
 Our success depends on our technical expertise, trade secrets, supply chain and manufacturing skills. However, during the normal course of business we have obtained or developed proprietary product requiring licensing, patent, copyright or trademark protection.
Competition
 The contract manufacturing EMS industry's competitive makeup includes small closely held contract manufacturing companies, large global full-service contract manufacturers, company-owned in-house manufacturing facilities and foreign contract manufacturers. We do not believe that the small closely held operations pose a significant competitive threat in the markets and customers we serve, as they generally do not have the complete manufacturing and engineering services or capabilities required by our target customers. We believe the larger global full service and foreign manufacturers are more focused on higher volume customer engagements and we do not see them as our primary competition. We continue to see opportunities with OEM companies that have their own in-house electronic manufacturing capabilities as they evaluate their internal costs and investments against outsourcing to contract manufacturers like us. We see trends of the low volume, high mix customer demand going to a regional supply base. This is a good fit with our operations in US, Mexico and Asia. We continue to study and investigate other regions and global alternatives to meet our competitive challenges and customer requirements.
Research and Development
 We perform research and development for customers on an as requested, project and program basis for development of conceptual engineering and design activities as well as products moving into production. We spent approximately $1.5 million and $0.5 million on product research and development in years ended 2022 and 2021, respectively. We continue to explore opportunities for developing proprietary manufacturing methods or products, particularly in complex wire and cable interconnect technologies.
Environmental Law Compliance
 We believe that our manufacturing facilities are currently operating in compliance with local, state, and federal environmental laws. We plan to continue acquiring environmental-oriented equipment and incurring the expenditures we deem necessary for compliance with applicable laws. Expenditures relating to compliance for operating facilities incurred in the past have not significantly affected our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

Government Regulation
 As a medical device manufacturer, we have additional compliance requirements. We are required to register with the FDA and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections and product field monitoring by the FDA. To support the quality requirements of our Aerospace and Defense market customers, all our US locations are International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) compliant.
Human Capital Resources
 We have 782 full-time and 50 part-time/temporary employees as of December 31, 2022. Manufacturing personnel, including direct, indirect support and sales functions, comprise 781 employees, while general administrative employees total 51.
 
Foreign Operations and Export Sales from Our Domestic Operations
 We have leased manufacturing facilities in Monterrey, Mexico and Suzhou, China. Monterrey, Mexico has approximately $494,000 and $454,000 in long-term assets, and $2,469,000 and $2,800,000 of right of use assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Suzhou, China has approximately $805,000 and $715,000 in long-term assets, and $384,000 and $896,000 of right of use assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Export sales from our domestic operations represented 4.0% and 3.1% of net sales the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
