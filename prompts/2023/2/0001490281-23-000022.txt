 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Groupon is a global scaled two-sided marketplace that connects consumers to merchants. Consumers access our marketplace through our mobile applications and our websites, which are primarily localized groupon.com sites in thirteen countries. We operate in two segments, North America and International, and in three categories, Local, Goods and Travel. See Item 1, Note 18, Segment Information, for additional information.
Revenue is earned through service revenue transactions, during which we generate commissions by selling goods or services on behalf of third-party merchants. Service revenue also includes commissions we earn when customers make purchases with retailers using digital coupons accessed through our digital properties. 
In prior periods, we generated product revenue from direct sales of our first-party Goods inventory. Our product revenue was reported on a gross basis as the purchase price received from the customer.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to be the trusted marketplace where customers go to buy local services and experiences. We plan to grow our revenue by building long-term relationships with local merchants to improve our inventory selection and improving the customer experience through inventory curation and improved convenience in order to drive customer demand and purchase frequency.
Our Categories
Local. Our Local category includes experiences and services from local and national merchants, and other revenue sources that are primarily generated through our relationships with local and national merchants. Our local inventory includes, things to do, beauty and wellness and dining, as well as other types of experiences and services.
Goods. In our Goods category, we earn service revenue from transactions in which third-party merchants sell products to customers through our marketplaces. We recognize Goods revenue on a net basis within service revenue. Our Goods category includes merchandise across multiple product lines, such as electronics, sporting goods, jewelry, toys, household items and apparel.
Travel. Through our Travel category, we feature travel experiences at both discounted and market rates, including hotels, airfare and package deals covering both domestic and international travel. For many of our travel experiences, the customer must contact the merchant directly to make a travel reservation after purchasing a travel voucher from us. However, for some of our hotel offerings, customers make room reservations directly through our websites and mobile applications.
Traffic Channels and Platforms
Our customers access our online local commerce marketplaces through our mobile applications and our websites. Our applications and mobile websites enable consumers to browse, purchase, manage and redeem deals on their mobile devices. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 80% of our global transactions were completed on mobile devices.
We use a variety of marketing channels to direct customers to the offerings available through these marketplaces, as described in the Marketing section below.
Marketing
We use marketing to acquire and retain customers and promote awareness of our marketplaces and brand. We use a variety of marketing channels to make customers aware of our offerings, including search engines, email and push notifications, affiliate channels, social and display advertising and offline marketing.
Search engines. Customers can access our offerings indirectly through third-party search engines. We use search engine optimization ("SEO") and search engine marketing ("SEM") to increase the visibility of our offerings in web search results. 
Email and mobile messaging. We communicate offerings through email and by push notifications to our customers based on their locations and personal preferences. A customer who interacts with an email or push notification is directed to our website or mobile application to learn more about the deal and to make a purchase. Additionally, we introduced short message service ("SMS") notifications in 2022.
Affiliate channels. We have an affiliate program that uses third parties to promote our offerings online. Affiliates earn commissions when customers access our offerings through links on their websites and make purchases on our platform.
Social and display. We promote and publish our content and offerings through various social networks and adapt our notifications to the particular format of each of these social networking platforms. Our websites and mobile applications enable consumers to share our offerings with their personal social networks. We also promote our offerings via display advertising across various content publishers.
Television and other offline. At times, we use other offline marketing channels such as connected television and traditional television advertising to help build awareness of our offerings and brand. 
Human Capital Management
We believe attracting and retaining global talent is key to our success. Our senior leadership team is responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy, with oversight from our Board of Directors (the "Board"). This includes the recruitment, development and retention of talent to support our operations and execute our strategy and the design of our employee compensation and benefit programs.
As of December 31, 2022, we had employees in the following geographies and roles: 

 | Sales | Corporate, Operational and Customer Support | | Total Employees
North America | 281 | | 518 | | 799 
International | 502 | | 1,603 | | 2,105
Total (1) | 783 | | 2,121 | | 2,904

(1)In January 2023, the board approved the second phase of the 2022 Restructuring Plan, which includes an overall reduction of approximately 500 positions globally.
Our sales force consists of merchant sales representatives and sales support staff who acquire and build merchant relationships and provide ongoing consultative expertise. Other key operational functions include engineering, product, marketing and editorial. 
Within our human capital strategy, there are five core pillars: Our People & Culture, Diversity, Equity & Inclusion ("DEI"), Compensation & Benefits, Social Responsibility, and Future of Work.
Our People & Culture. Groupon helps customers discover experiences that make for a full, fun, and rewarding life. We take the same approach to our work culture - we believe that having teams of resilient, energized, diverse, and collaborative people from all over the world make Groupon unique. Our goal is to support a culture that inspires innovation, rewards smart decision-making, and celebrates success. 
In 2022, we conducted quarterly Pulse Engagement Surveys to gain insights into the engagement levels of our team members and to measure the overall health of our culture. These surveys covered a wide range of topics including well-being, engagement, leadership, performance and strategy, and DEI. Managers used the responses to identify focus areas for their teams and to implement formal action plans. We had strong employee engagement scores with an 80% response rate.
Each of our employees play an important role in ensuring that we maintain a high level of business ethics, safety, and integrity. To facilitate this, all employees are required to complete the following full-length training courses once every two years: 
•Global Code of Conduct;
•Anti-Corruption; and
•Respectful and Harassment Free Workplace.
In alternate years, employees are required to complete a Global Code of Conduct Recertification Quiz. Additionally, we have established an internal process called Groupon Ethics Reporting Service, which is communicated to employees during the annual ethics training and can be used to bring to management’s attention a wide range of concerns, including violations of our policies.
To support the career development of our team members, we offer a variety of training and development programs supporting our ethics, workplace culture and manager behaviors. For example, we require all employees to complete unconscious bias training and all managers to complete Respect in the Workplace training. We also offer various other training programs to employees, such as Change & Resilience, Managing Through Change, FS90 (a course that reinforces leader habits and manager expectations for new managers), Authentic Allyship Workshops, and a Director Development Program to equip leaders with the tools they need to succeed, We also launched Accelerate, a 7-month program designed and run in partnership with the organization everywoman with the goal to accelerate the development and careers of our top female talent. Additionally, we encourage cross-team growth opportunities through our Internal Talent Mobility process.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Diversity, equity and inclusion is integrated into our business and we believe that attracting and retaining diverse, global talent will create a culture where everyone can feel like they belong, find authentic connections and take part in experiences that connect to their own identities. We also want the diversity of our internal team to reflect the diversity of the merchants and customers we serve and the communities in which we live and work. We believe that a global team of employees with diverse experiences, backgrounds, skills and perspectives will allow us to take a more innovative approach to problem solving and lead to better outcomes and higher productivity. Our company-wide DEI program includes a range of initiatives and programs that have the overarching goal of making our employees, merchants and customers feel seen and valued, including:
•Analytics-based approach to provide data-driven insights and increase visibility as we aim to improve workforce diversity, identify inequities and reduce turnover;
•Employee Resource Groups;
•Diverse merchant self-identification; 
•Inclusive leadership training program for employees; and
•Multiple merchant-facing campaigns and employee-facing celebrations including Asian American Pacific Islander Month, Pride Month, Juneteenth, National Black Business Month, National Hispanic Heritage Awareness Month, Global Diversity Awareness Month and Women’s Small Business Month.
Compensation and Benefits. To attract and retain qualified employees, we offer competitive compensation and comprehensive benefits, which are designed to attract, reward, and engage top talent and include standard health, dental, vision, life and disability insurance benefits as well as a 401(k) plan with company matching for our U.S. employees. In addition, Groupon is focused on the health and well-being of employees, and we have significantly expanded our wellness programming to combat burnout and support the overall health of global teams. Our wellness program includes access to mental health support and services, Global Wellness Week, which is an entire week dedicated to personal wellness programming aimed at boosting all of our physical, nutritional and mental well-being, as well as digital detox days. We also provide Talkspace, a virtual service that connects employees and family members with licensed mental health providers for counseling and therapy. 
Social Responsibility. We are committed to empowering our employees to take part in making the communities in which we operate better places to work and live. We provide numerous opportunities for our employees to volunteer with causes they care about throughout the year and support communities through investment in local and global nonprofits focused on systemic issues like economic opportunity and hunger relief. In 2022, we supported nearly 2,000 small businesses and entrepreneurs globally through social responsibility programming and approximately 43% of our workforce engaged in community activities through the Groupon Volunteers program.
Future of Work. We believe it is important for our employees to do their jobs where they feel they can do it best. Whether that means working remotely from home or in one of our global offices - we want our employees to thrive in a work environment that suits their needs. 
Following office closures from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, we launched a test of an approach that we call “@flex.” Flex, which represents our “flexibility” and related hybrid working options, was rolled out incrementally across our 20 offices worldwide. 
Our goal is to nurture a performance-driven culture - one that will be led by our values and focused on agility, results and accountability. We believe that this culture is foundational to our ability to drive our organization toward our long-term vision of being the destination for Local experiences. We intend to continue to focus on driving measurable results that will "show up" in our ability to attract and retain talent and build a resilient workforce well positioned to help us reach our long-term goals.
Technology
 In early 2023, we completed the migration of our public-facing websites, internal applications and services, as well as our back-end business intelligence systems from being hosted at our data centers to a multi-cloud infrastructure. We employ security practices and modern tools to try to recognize intrusions to our technology infrastructure. We engage independent third-party Internet security firms to regularly test the security of our websites and identify vulnerabilities. In financial transactions with customers conducted on our websites and mobile applications, we use data encryption protocols to secure information while in transit. See Risk Factors for additional information relating to potential cyber threats. 
Competition
Our customers and merchants are at the center of our two-sided marketplace. The quality and stability of both our customers and merchants are key to our business model. We face competition on both sides of our marketplace.
We compete with other marketplaces, and some of our competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources. In addition, we compete with companies who address only specific verticals in the local experiences market, and in our Goods and Travel categories, companies who have greater scale and larger customer bases than we do. These factors may allow our competitors to benefit from their existing customer base with lower acquisition costs or to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer trends. These competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns and adopt more aggressive pricing policies, which may allow them to build a larger subscriber base or to monetize that subscriber base more effectively than we do.
We also compete with companies that can offer alternative services for our merchants. There are companies that offer other types of advertising and promotional services to local businesses. Our merchants could choose to leverage these other platforms to attract customers to their businesses. We believe we can compete due to the access we provide our merchants to our large customer base, our trusted brand, and the investments we are making in self-service tools that will allow merchants to manage demand more effectively and better attract and retain customers.
Regulation
We are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet. Additionally, those laws and regulations may be interpreted differently across domestic and foreign jurisdictions. As a company in a relatively new and rapidly innovating industry, we are exposed to the risk that many of those laws may evolve or be interpreted by regulators or in the courts in ways that could materially affect our business. Those laws and regulations may involve taxation, unclaimed property, intellectual property, product liability, travel, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, consumer protection, the provision of various online payment services, employee, merchant and customer privacy and data security or other areas.
The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the "CARD Act"), as well as the laws of most states, contain provisions governing gift cards, gift certificates, stored value or pre-paid cards or coupons ("gift cards"). Groupon vouchers may be included within the definition of "gift cards" under many laws. In addition, certain foreign jurisdictions have laws that govern disclosure and certain product terms and conditions, including restrictions on expiration dates and fees, that may apply to Groupon vouchers. There are also a number of 
legislative proposals pending before the U.S. Congress, various state legislative bodies and foreign governments that could affect us, and our global operations may be constrained by regulatory regimes and laws in Europe and other jurisdictions outside the United States that may be more restrictive and adversely impact our business.
Various U.S. laws and regulations, such as the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (the "Bank Secrecy Act"), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the USA PATRIOT Act and the CARD Act impose certain anti-money laundering requirements on companies that are financial institutions or that provide financial products and services. Those laws and regulations broadly define financial institutions to include money services businesses such as money transmitters, check cashers and sellers or issuers of stored value. Requirements imposed on financial institutions under those laws include customer identification and verification programs, record retention policies and procedures and transaction reporting. We do not believe that we are a financial institution subject to those laws and regulations.
We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state and international laws and regulations governing consumer data. The General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), which was adopted by the European Union and became effective in May 2018 and the California Privacy Rights Act (the "CPRA"), which expands on and effectively replaces the California Consumer Privacy Act (the "CCPA") and became effective January 1, 2023, requires companies to satisfy specific requirements regarding the handling of personal and sensitive data, including its collection, use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to, among other things, access and/or delete such data about themselves. The Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (the "CDPA") and the Colorado Privacy Act (the "CPA"), which will both go into effect in 2023, provide new data privacy rights to their respective residents. Our ongoing efforts to comply with these laws and regulations and other relevant privacy and data protection laws and regulations, have required updates to certain business practices and systems. Non-compliance with any privacy and data protection laws and regulations could result in significant monetary fines. For instance, non-compliance with the GDPR could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others and fines up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of annual global revenue and non-compliance with CPRA could result in fines of up to $7,500 per violation in addition to providing consumers with a private right of action. We continue to monitor developments in laws and regulations relating to privacy and consumer data, and we expect these evolving laws and regulations will continue to impact our business in the future.
Intellectual Property
We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties.
In addition to those contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, domain names and patents to protect our intellectual property. Groupon and its related entities own a number of trademarks and service marks registered or pending in the United States and internationally. In addition, we own a number of issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and internationally and own and have applied for copyright registrations in the United States.
Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights and the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective or deter independent development of equivalent or superior intellectual property rights by others. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time-consuming. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.
Companies in the Internet, technology and other industries as well as non-practicing entities may own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks or other intellectual property rights and may request license agreements, threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We are currently subject to, and expect to face in the future, lawsuits and allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties. As our business evolves, we may face more claims of infringement, and may experience an adverse result which could impact our business and/or our operating results.
We have received in the past, and we anticipate we will receive in the future, communications alleging that items offered or sold through our website infringe third-party copyrights, trademarks, patents and trade names or other intellectual property rights or that we have otherwise infringed third parties’ past, current or future intellectual property rights. We may be unable to prevent third parties from offering and selling unlawful or infringing goods or goods of disputed authenticity, and we may be subject to allegations of civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities carried out by third parties through our website. We may implement measures in an effort to protect against these potential liabilities that could require us to spend substantial resources and/or to reduce revenue by discontinuing certain service offerings. Any costs incurred as a result of liability or asserted liability relating to the sale of unlawful or infringing goods or goods of disputed authenticity or other infringement related claims could harm our business.
