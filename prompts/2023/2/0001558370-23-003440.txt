Item 1. Business
Unless the context otherwise requires, references to “we”, “us”, “our”, “the Company”, or “Target Hospitality” refer to Target Hospitality Corp. and its consolidated subsidiaries. During 2021, the Company changed the names of select reportable segments to appropriately align with its diversified hospitality and facilities service offerings. The segments formerly known as Permian Basin and Bakken Basin are now referred to as Hospitality & Facilities Services – South (“HFS – South”) and Hospitality & Facilities Services – Midwest (“HFS – Midwest”), respectively. All other reportable segment names remain unchanged.
​
Overview
​
Our company, Target Hospitality, is one of the largest vertically integrated specialty rental and hospitality services companies in North America. We have an extensive network of geographically relocatable specialty rental accommodation units with 16,830 beds across 27 communities. We also operate 2 communities not owned or leased by the Company. The majority of our revenues are generated under committed contracts which provide visibility to future earnings and cash flows. We believe our customers enter into contracts with us because of our differentiated scale and ability to deliver premier accommodations and in-house culinary and hospitality services across many key geographies in which they operate. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated revenues of approximately $502 million. Approximately 66.5% of our revenue was earned from specialty rental with vertically integrated hospitality, specifically lodging and related ancillary services, whereas the remaining 33.5% of revenues were earned through leasing of lodging facilities for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
For additional information on our revenue related to December 31, 2022 and 2021, refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” located in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
Target Hospitality, though initially founded in 1978, began operating as a specialty rental and hospitality services company in 2006. Our company operates across the U.S., primarily in the Southwest and the Midwest. We also own and operate the largest family residential center in the U.S. Target Hospitality provides comprehensive turnkey solutions to customers’ unique needs, from the initial planning stages through the full cycle of development and ongoing operations. We provide cost-effective and customized specialty rental accommodations, culinary services and hospitality solutions, including site design, construction, operations, security, housekeeping, catering, concierge services and health and recreation facilities.
We have established a leadership position in providing a fully integrated service offering to our large customer base, which is comprised of the United States government service providers, major companies supporting natural resource developments, and large-scale infrastructure projects throughout the United States. Our company is built on the foundation of the following core values: safety, care, excellence, integrity and collaboration.

Background 
​
For discussion of the background of the business combination, please read the “Background” section located in the Item 1. Business section in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2020 filed on May 24, 2021 and is incorporated herein by reference.
​
Upon completion of the business combination on March 15, 2019, the Nasdaq trading symbols of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”), and our Warrants (as defined below) were changed to “TH” and “THWWW,” respectively.
Business Model
​
Our business model allows our customers to focus their efforts and resources on their core businesses. This makes us an integral part of the planning and execution phases for all customers.
We provide a safe, comfortable, and healthy environment to our guests, employees and workers across the U.S. and anywhere our customers need our facilities and services. Under our “Target 12” service model, we provide benefits to our customers, delivering high quality food, rest, connection, wellness, community, and hospitality, which optimizes our customers’ workforce engagement, performance, safety, loyalty, and productivity during work hours.
This facility and service model is provided directly by our employees, who deliver the essential services 24 hours per day for 365 days a year. We provide all of the hospitality services at our sites, and as a result, we believe we deliver more consistent and high-quality hospitality services at each community compared to our peers. Our company and employees are driven by our primary objective of helping our customers’ workforce reach their full potential every day. Our professionally trained hospitality staff has the unique opportunity to live with our customers as most of our employees live on location at the communities where our customers’ workforce reside. This allows our employees to develop powerful customer empathy, so we are better able to deliver consistent service quality and care through the Target 12 platform each day. Our employees are focused on the “other 12 hours”—the time our customers and their 

4



employees are not working—making sure we deliver a well fed, well rested, happier, loyal, safer and more productive employee every day. What we provide our customers’ workforce “off the clock” optimizes their performance when they are “on the clock.” The investment our customers make in their employees the “other 12 hours” is an essential part of their strategy and overall business and operations execution plan.
Using our expansive community network, unique core competencies and full-service turnkey hospitality solutions, we provide critical facilities and hospitality support services for fully integrated natural resource development companies and contractors of the United States Government. Our assets are well-suited to support the full lifecycle of development plans and we are able to scale our facility size to meet customers’ growing needs. We are well-positioned to continue serving our customers throughout the full cycle of their projects, which typically last for several decades. Our integrated model provides value to our customers by reducing project timing and counterparty risks associated with projects. More broadly, our accommodations networks, combined with our integrated value-added hospitality and facilities services creates value for our customers by optimizing their engagement, performance, safety, loyalty, productivity, preparedness and profitability.
Summary of Value-Added Services
We take great pride in the premium customer experience we offer across our range of community and hospitality services offerings. The majority of Target’s communities include in-house culinary and hospitality services. Our world-class culinary and catering professionals serve approximately 14,000,000 meals on average each year with fresh ingredients and many of our meals are made from scratch. We self-manage most culinary and hospitality services, which provides us with greater control over service quality as well as incremental revenue and profit potential. Our communities are designed to promote rest and quality of life for our customers’ workforces and include amenities such as:

​
Our hospitality services and programming are designed to promote safety, security and rest, which in turn promote greater on-the-job productivity for our customers’ workforces. Our communities strictly adhere to our community code of conduct, which, among other things, prohibits drugs, illegal firearms, co-habitation and guests. We work closely with our customers to ensure that our communities are an extension of the safe environment and culture they aim to provide to their employees while they are on a project location. Our community code of conduct is adopted by each corporate customer and enforced in conjunction with our customers through their documented health, safety and environmental policies, standards and customer management. We recognize that safety and security extends beyond the customers’ jobsite and is a 24-hour responsibility which requires 24-hour services by Target Hospitality in close collaboration with our customers.

​
We are one of the few vertically integrated specialty rental and hospitality services providers that service the entire value chain from site identification to long-term community development and facilities management. Our industry divides specialty rental accommodations into three primary types: communities, temporary worker lodges and mobile assets. We are principally focused on communities across several end markets, including natural resource developments, large-scale infrastructure and U.S. government.

6



Communities typically contain a larger number of rooms and require more time and capital to develop. These facilities typically have commercial kitchens, dining areas, conference rooms, medical and dental services, recreational facilities, media lounges and landscaped grounds where climate permits. A substantial portion of our communities are built and underpinned by multi-year committed contracts which often include exclusivity provisions. These facilities are designed to serve the long-term needs of customers regardless of the end markets they serve. Our communities provide fully-integrated and value-added hospitality services, including but not limited to: catering and food services, housekeeping, health and recreation facilities, laundry services and overall workforce community management, as well as water and wastewater treatment, power generation, communications and personnel logistics where required. In contrast, temporary lodges are usually smaller in number of rooms and generally do not include hospitality, catering, facilities services or other value-added on-site services and typically serve customers on a spot or short-term basis without long-term committed contracts. These temporary facilities are “open” for any customer who needs lodging services. Finally, mobile assets, or rig housing, are designed to follow customers’ activities and are generally used for drilling rig operators. They are often used to support conventional drilling crews and are contracted on a project-by-project or short-term basis.
Our specialty rental modular assets and hospitality services deliver the essential services and accommodations when and where there is a lack of sufficient accessible or cost-effective housing, infrastructure or local labor. Many of the geographic areas near the southern U.S. border lack sufficient temporary housing and infrastructure for asylum-seeking immigrants or may require additional infrastructure in the future. In the U.S. natural resource development industry, many of the largest hydrocarbon reservoirs are in remote and expansive geographic locations, like the Southwestern portion of the United States and North Dakota where limited infrastructure exists. We support the development of these necessary natural resources by providing the fully-integrated and value-added hospitality services described above. Our communities and integrated hospitality services allow our customers to outsource their accommodations needs to a single provider, optimizing employee morale, productivity, safety, and loyalty while focusing their investment on their core businesses and long term planning.
The communities we own, operate, or manage, as well as those facilities we own but are managed by other operators, are subject to competition for residents from other private operators. We compete primarily on location, cost, the quality and range of services offered, our experience in the design, construction, and management of facilities, and our reputation. We compete with government agencies that are responsible for residential facilities. Government sector demand for facilities is affected by a number of factors, including the demand for beds, general economic conditions and the size of the populations needing these services.
Demand for accommodations and related services within the natural resource development end market is influenced by four primary factors: (i) available infrastructure, (ii) competition, (iii) workforce requirements, and (iv) capital spending. Anticipated capital spending, and our customers’ expectations for future capital spending as well as larger infrastructure requirements, influence customers’ development on current productive assets, maintenance on current assets, expansion of existing assets and development of greenfield, brownfield or new assets. In addition to capital requirements, different types of customer activity require varying workforce sizes, influencing the demand for accommodations. Also, competing locations and services influence demand for our assets and services.
Demand within our government end market is primarily influenced by immigration, including the ongoing need to accommodate asylum seekers and unaccompanied minors as well as federal governmental policy and budgets. Continued increases in immigration activity have influenced government spending on infrastructure in immigration-impacted regions and consequentially demand for accommodations and related services.
Another factor that influences demand for our rooms and services is the type of customer we are supporting. Generally, natural resource development customers require larger workforces during construction and expansionary periods and therefore have a higher demand for accommodations. Due to the contiguous nature of their land positions, a “hub and spoke” model is utilized. Customers that support natural resource development also require larger and more mobile

workforces which, in many cases, consist of employees sourced from outside of the work areas. These employees, described as rotational workers, permanently reside in another region or state and commute to the regions served by our HFS – South or HFS – Midwest segments on a rotational basis (often, two weeks on and one week off). 
In addition, proximity to customer activities influences occupancy and demand. We have built, own and operate the two largest specialty rental and hospitality services networks available to customers operating in the regions served by our HFS – South and HFS – Midwest segments. These networks allow our customers to utilize one provider across a large and expansive geographic area. Our broad network often results in us having communities that are the closest to our customers’ job sites, which reduces commute times and costs, and improves the overall safety of our customers’ workforce.
Generally, if a community is within a one hour drive of a customer’s work location, our contractual exclusivity provisions with our customers require the customers to have their workforce lodge at one of our communities. Our communities provide customers with cost efficiencies, as they are able to jointly use our communities and related infrastructure (power, water, sewer and IT) services alongside other customers operating in the same vicinity.
Demand for our services is dependent upon activity levels, particularly our customers’ capital spending on natural resource development activities and government housing programs. Our customers’ spending plans generally are based on their view of commodity supply and demand dynamics, as well as the outlook for their medium and long-term commodity prices and annual government appropriations. Our current footprint supporting natural resource development customers is strategically concentrated in the southwestern portion of the United States near the Permian Basin region served by our HFS – South segment. The Permian stretches across the southeast corner of New Mexico and through a large portion of land in western Texas, encompassing approximately a hundred thousand square miles and dozens of counties and is the lowest cost basin in the U.S., providing the most economic natural resource development inventory.
Business Strengths & Strategies
Strengths
​

● | Market Leader in Strategically Located Geographies. We are one of North America’s largest providers of turnkey specialty rental units with premium catering and hospitality services including 29 strategically located communities with approximately 16,800 beds primarily in the highest demand regions of the southwestern United States. Utilizing our large network of communities with the most bed capacity, particularly within the regions served by our Government, HFS – South and HFS – Midwest segments, we believe we are the only provider with the scale and regional density to serve all of our customers’ needs in these key areas. Additionally, our network and relocatable facility assets allow us to transfer the rental fleet to locations that meet our customer service needs across our segments allowing us to achieve a higher return on capital. We leverage our scale and experience to deliver a comprehensive service offering of vertically integrated accommodations and hospitality services that provides a compelling economic value proposition to our customers.

​

● | Long-Standing Relationships with Diversified Large Integrated Customers. We have long standing relationships with our diversified base of approximately 300 customers, which includes some of the largest blue-chip, investment grade natural resource development and integrated infrastructure companies in North America. We believe we have also established strong relationships in our U.S. government end market with our contract partners and the federal agencies we serve. We initially won our large government sub-contract in 2014 based upon our differentiated ability to develop and open a permanent large-scale facility on an accelerated timeline. This contract was renewed and extended in 2016 and 2020, demonstrating our successful execution and customer satisfaction. The relationships we have established over the past decade have been built on trust and credibility given our track record of performance and delivering value to our customers by providing a broad range of hospitality service offerings within a community atmosphere. Target’s customers’ willingness to enter into multi- year committed contracts, and our historical client retainment rate of over 90%, demonstrates the strength of these long-standing relationships.

​

● | Committed Revenue and Exclusivity Produce Highly Visible, Recurring Revenue. The vast majority of our revenues are generated under multi-year contracts that include committed payment terms or exclusivity provisions, under which our customers agree to use our network for all their accommodation needs within the geographies we serve. In 2022, approximately 74% of our revenues had committed payment provisions and approximately 99% were under long-term contract, including exclusivity. The weighted average length of our contracts is approximately 50 months and we have maintained a consistent client renewal rate of over 90% for the last 5 years. Our customers enter into long-term agreements and consistently renew their contracts to ensure that sufficient accommodations and hospitality services are in place to properly care for their large workforces. Our multi-year contracts and consistent renewal rates provide recurring revenue and high visibility on future financial performance.

● | Proven Performance and Resiliency Through the Various Economic Cycles. Our business model is generally well insulated from economic cycles. For example, we secured a major new contract in 2021 as well as a renewal and extension in 2020 and in 2022, each under our Government Segment which together represents approximately 72% of Target Hospitality’s 2022 revenue. Additionally, we utilize the same asset base across our operating segments, which allows us to efficiently optimize our modular assets and redeploy them, as warranted by customer demand. In 2022, this asset continuity allowed us to quickly react to dynamic growth opportunities in our Government segment by redeploying underutilized assets from our HFS – Midwest segment. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Long-lived Assets Requiring Minimal Maintenance Capital Expenditures. Our long-lived specialty rental assets support robust cash flow generation. Our rental assets have an average life in excess of 15 years, and we typically recover our initial investment within the first few years of initial capital deployment. Our maintenance capital between 2018 and 2022 has ranged from approximately 0.4% to 4% of annual revenue with an average of 1.8% of annual revenue. We maintain low maintenance capital expenditures, as cleaning and routine maintenance costs are included in day-to-day operating costs and recovered through the average daily rates that we charge our customers. This continual care of our assets supports extended asset lives and the ongoing ability to operate with only nominal maintenance capital expenditures. The investment profile of our rental assets underpins our industry leading unit economics. Our contract discipline underpins our investment decision making and any spending on new growth investments is underwritten by contracts, with no speculative building. Generally, we do not invest capital unless we expect to meet our internal return thresholds. Due to the high revenue visibility from long-term contracts, we are poised to generate robust and stable cash flows driven by historical strategic growth investments and minimal future maintenance capital expenditure requirements.

​
Strategies
We believe that we can further develop our business by, among other things:

● | Expansion Through Acquisitions and Diversify Our Service Offerings. We selectively pursue acquisitions and business combinations related to specialty rental and hospitality services in the markets we currently serve as well as adjacent markets that offer existing complimentary services to ours. Leveraging our core competencies related to facilities management, culinary services, catering and site services, we believe that we can further scale these elements of our business and replicate it in other geographies and end markets. We continue to assess targeted acquisitions and business combinations that would be accretive to us while also expanding our end markets.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Maintaining and Expanding Existing Customer Relationships. Growing and maintaining key customer relationships is a strategic priority. We fill existing bed capacity within our communities, while optimizing our inventory for existing customer expansion or for new customers. Keeping this balance provides us with flexibility and a competitive advantage when pursuing new contract opportunities as top-tier customers find enhanced value in the scale and flexibility of Target’s world class network, which supports their comprehensive and dynamic housing and food management requirements. With the scale of our accommodations network, a significant number of our key customers are commercially exclusive to Target Hospitality as their primary and preferred provider of accommodations and hospitality services throughout the U.S. or for a designated geographic area.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Enhancing Contract Scope and Services. One of our strategic focus areas is to enhance the scope and terms of our customer contracts. We intend to continue our historical track record of renewing and extending these contracts at favorable commercial and economic terms, while also providing additional value added services to our customers. For example, we have expanded our presence across multiple government agencies creating broad reaching opportunities to extend reach beyond our core

accommodations platform. Intentionally growing revenue in an attractive government services end market, allowed us to high-grade contracts and significantly expand Target’s growth pipeline.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Disciplined Growth Capital Expenditures to Increase Capacity. We selectively pursue opportunities to expand existing communities and develop new communities to satisfy customer demand. We employ rigorous discipline to our capital expenditures to grow our business. Our investment strategy is generally to only deploy new capital with visibility—typically a contract—to revenue and returns to meet our internal return hurdles often with capital recovery mechanisms. We target high returns on invested capital and achieve these returns due to our high cash-on-cash margin profile.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Growing and Pursuing New Customer/Contract Opportunities. We continually seek additional opportunities to lease our facilities to government, natural resource development, and other third-party owners or operators in need of specialty rental and hospitality services. We have a proven track record of success in executing our specialty rental and facilities management model across several end markets for ongoing needs as well as major projects that have finite project life cycle durations. A strong national presence creates a platform to expand geographical reach into a wide range of industry applications, while significantly expanding Target’s longterm growth pipeline by utilizing existing core competencies to broaden service offerings across a variety of business and commercial applications. While special projects do not constitute a large portion of our business, it is typical for us to secure some special projects that can last anywhere from 1-5 years (or more). We have designated sales-related resources that focus on special finite life cycle projects and maintain a dynamic business pipeline which includes but is not limited to special projects across end markets.

Business Operations

Target Hospitality provides specialty rental and hospitality services, temporary specialty rental and hospitality services solutions and facilities management services across North America. The Company’s primary customers are U.S. Government related contractors, investment grade natural resource development companies and other workforce accommodation providers operating in the regions served by our HFS – South and Midwest segments. The Company’s specialty rental and hospitality and management services are highly customizable and are tailored to each customer’s needs and requirements. Target Hospitality is also an approved U.S. General Services Administration (“GSA”) contract holder and offers a comprehensive range of housing, deployment, operations and management services through its GSA professional services schedule agreement. The GSA contract allows U.S. federal agencies to acquire our products and services directly from Target Hospitality which expedites the commercial procurement process often required by government agencies.

Target Hospitality operates its business in four key end markets: (i) government (“Government”), which includes the facilities, services and operations of (a) the family residential center and the related support communities in Dilley, Texas (the “South Texas Family Residential Center”) provided pursuant to its lease and services agreement with a national provider of migrant programming; and (b) several facilities in West, Texas provided pursuant to its lease and services agreement with a leading national nonprofit organization (“NP Partner”) in support of their humanitarian aid efforts, both locations backed by committed United States Government contracts; (ii) HFS – South, which includes the facilities and operations in fourteen communities located across Texas and New Mexico; (iii) HFS – Midwest, which includes facilities and operations in three communities in North Dakota; and (iv) TCPL Keystone (“TCPL Keystone”), which provided ongoing preparatory work and plans for facilities and services provided in connection with the TC Energy (formerly TransCanada) Keystone pipeline project. The Company terminated the underlying contract and settled with TC Energy in July 2021 related to these ongoing preparatory work and plans, which eliminated all activity from this end market subsequent to July 2021.

Government
The Government segment includes, but is not limited to, two primary end markets which make up approximately 72% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022:

● | Residential Facilities. Residential facilities, including the South Texas Family Residential Center (discussed below), provide space and residential services in an open and safe environment to women with children. Residential facilities offer services including, but not limited to, educational programs, medical care, recreational activities, counseling, and access to religious and legal services.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Humanitarian Aid Efforts. Community facilities providing a suite of comprehensive service offerings supporting humanitarian aid efforts.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Target Hospitality built and currently leases and operates the South Texas Family Residential Center through a sub-lease and services agreement with a national provider of migrant programming, which provides management services. Target Hospitality owns the facility and provides select on-site services including catering, culinary, management, janitorial and light maintenance. The South Texas Family Residential Center includes 524,000 square feet of building space including residential housing units with 2,400 beds, as well as classrooms, a library, chapels, an infirmary with full medical, dental, pharmaceutical and x-ray capabilities, a dining hall, offices and an industrial laundry center.

In March 2021, the Company entered into a lease and services agreement with our NP Partner, backed by a committed United States Government contract, to provide a suite of comprehensive service offerings in support of their humanitarian aid efforts at a residential housing facility. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company executed a new contract with our NP Partner that became effective on May 16, 2022, which represented a significantly expanded lease and services agreement (“Expanded Humanitarian Contract”) to provide enhanced infrastructure and comprehensive facility services that support the critical hospitality solutions the Company provides to the NP Partner and the U.S. Government in their humanitarian aid missions. The Expanded Humanitarian Contract provided for a significant scope expansion and term extension for the continuation of services provided under the agreement that originated in March 2021 with approximately 6,375 beds. This partnership is consistent with our Government segment and strategy of diversifying end-markets through high quality contracts with premier partners that provide strong revenue visibility and cash flows.
We look forward to expanding the products and services of our Government segment through our GSA designations, specifically our designation to maintain the professional services schedule (“PSS”) for logistics service solutions, which are designed to assist federal agencies in procuring comprehensive logistics solutions, including planning, consulting, management, and operational support when deploying supplies, equipment, materials and associated personnel. GSA’s PSS is a multiple award schedule (“MAS”) contract for innovative solutions, offered to federal, state and local governments, for their professional service’s needs. Having a PSS signifies that we have been vetted as a responsible supplier, our pricing has been determined to be fair and reasonable and we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. PSS is one of the GSA’s schedule contracts, which are indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (“IDIQ”), long-term contracts under the GSA MAS program. GSA schedule contracts were developed to assist federal employees in purchasing products and services and they contain pre-negotiated prices, delivery terms, warranties, and other terms and conditions which streamline the buying process.
The Government segment generated approximately 72% or $360.3 million of the Company’s revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. The map below shows the Company’s primary community locations in the Government segment.

Hospitality & Facilities Services - South
The HFS – South segment serves an area that stretches across the southeast corner of New Mexico and a large portion of western Texas, encompassing approximately a hundred thousand square miles and dozens of counties. This geographic area, also known as the Permian Basin, is one of the world’s oldest natural resource producing regions. Our customers utilize both unconventional and conventional development techniques, encompassing multiple stacked development zones, which increases the potential recoverable resource and lengthens their development lifecycle.
While understanding the significant economic potential in this region, Target entered the market in 2012, ahead of many of our competitors. We started in HFS – South with an 80-bed community in Pecos, TX.
As of December 31, 2022, with 14 communities and approximately 6,000 beds across HFS – South, we offer the largest network of turnkey specialty rental accommodations and hospitality services. 
The HFS - South segment generated approximately 26% or $132.4 million of the Company’s revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. The map below shows the Company’s primary community locations in the HFS – South region. 

Hospitality & Facilities Services - Midwest
The HFS – Midwest segment serves an area that spans North Dakota and is home to the largest concentration of natural resource development in the geographic region.
In 2009, we entered this regional market and built our first community in Williston, North Dakota for a large natural resources services company. The community was the first of its kind in the region and provided specialty rental and hospitality services for more than 150 remote workers. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had three community locations and 706 available beds serving customers in the HFS – Midwest region. We are the largest specialty rental and hospitality services provider in the region with approximately 35% of the market share with the next closest direct competitor having less than 16% of the market share.

15



The HFS - Midwest segment generated approximately 1% or $6.2 million of the Company’s revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. The map below shows the Company’s community locations in the region.

TCPL Keystone
Future Pipeline Services Plans
​
We contracted with TC Energy to construct, deliver, cater and manage all accommodations and hospitality services in conjunction with the planned construction of the TCPL Keystone project. Our contract with TC Energy was executed in 2013. In October 2018, we received partial release for certain pre-work related to the project and performed a limited scope of work based on work orders issued by TC Energy.
During 2020, activity related to this segment increased to a level that resulted in revenue exceeding 10% of our consolidated revenues for the first time and as such, this segment became a reportable segment in 2020.
In January 2021, the TCPL Keystone project was suspended due to the revocation of the Keystone XL Presidential Permit. Consequently, on July 23, 2021, the Company executed a Termination and Settlement Agreement (the “Termination and Settlement Agreement”) terminating the Company’s contract with TC Energy that was originated in 2013. As a result of the Termination and Settlement Agreement, no further activity is expected in this segment.
All Other
In addition to the four reportable segments above, the Company: (i) has facilities and operations for one community in Oklahoma; (ii) has facilities and operations for one community in Canada; and (iii) provides catering and other services to communities and other workforce accommodation facilities for the natural resource development industries not owned by Target Hospitality (“Facilities Management”).

16



The Company provides specialty rental and hospitality services including concierge, culinary, catering, maintenance, security, janitorial and related services at facilities owned by other companies. We currently provide Facilities Management, culinary and catering services and site services for one facility located in Wyoming for which we do not own the specialty rental accommodation assets.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had two customers, who accounted for approximately 28% and 19% of our revenue, respectively.
​
Generally, the Company competes based on factors including quality and breadth of available locations and room utilization, modular construction time and development expertise, proactive logistics management, geographic areas serviced, average daily rate, facility quality, and food management.
​

17



The accommodation facilities market in our HFS business is segmented into competitors that serve components of the overall value chain, but very few offer the entire suite of hospitality services to our customers. Our HFS competitors primarily include small, independent businesses with a few locations, often with little to no contracts and with significantly fewer rooms, or RV parks that offer no turn-key services or modular accommodation solutions.
​
The accommodations market within our government business is generally segmented into competitors that primarily serve as temporary facilities with seasonal contracts, and tent providers with limited scale and services. U.S. Government sites typically do not own and operate the full suite of hospitality solutions, but contract out to third-parties for more limited offerings and on a shorter-term basis.
​
The Company’s Community and Services Contracts
For the year ended December 31, 2022, revenue related to the HFS – South and HFS – Midwest segments represented approximately 26% and 1% of our revenue, respectively, revenue related to our Government segment represented 72% of our revenue, revenue related to our TCPL Keystone segment represented 0% of our revenue, and Other revenue represented less than 1% of our revenue.
Lease and Services Agreements
The Company’s operations in the HFS – South and HFS – Midwest segments are primarily conducted through committed contractual minimum revenue arrangements with its customers. For certain of the Company’s largest customers, it uses network lease and services agreements (“NLSAs”) which cover the customer’s full enterprise and are exclusive agreements with set terms and rates for all geographic regions in which the Company operates. The NLSAs obligate the customers to use the Company’s facilities and services across the U.S. The Company’s NLSAs have an average set term of two to three years.
Certain other customers are subject to lease and services agreements (“LSAs”) which are more limited in geographic scope and cover only specified areas with the same structural commercial terms as the NLSAs. The LSAs obligate customers to pay for a fixed amount of rooms over a term regardless of occupancy with terms that can range from one month to multiple years. LSAs generally do not have termination provisions in favor of the customer.
The Company also has master services agreements (“MSAs”) with certain customers which are typically exclusive arrangements without the committed component of the NLSAs and LSAs and no minimum contractual liability for the customer.
The Company’s operations in the Government segment includes the South Texas Family Residential Center pursuant to a contractual arrangement (the “Family Residential Center Contract” or “FRCC”) with a national provider of migrant programming (the “FRCC Partner”). This FRCC provides for the Company’s sublease and ongoing operation of the South Texas Family Residential Center through September 2026. 
Our FRCC Partner depends on the U.S. government and its funding. Any impasse or delay in reaching a federal budget agreement, debt ceiling or government shutdowns, and the subsequent lack of funding to the applicable government entity, could result in material payment delays, payment reductions or contract terminations. The government may terminate the contract with our FRCC Partner for convenience on 60 days’ notice; in the event this should occur, our FRCC Partner may terminate its agreement with us upon 60 days’ notice.
The Company also operates several facilities in connection with a lease and services agreement with the NP Partner, backed by a committed United States Government contract, to provide a suite of comprehensive service offerings in support of their humanitarian aid efforts. The initial contract, including subsequent change orders and amendments, had a value of approximately $129 million and was fully committed over its initial one-year term, which commenced March 18, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company executed the Expanded Humanitarian 

18



Contract with our NP Partner that became effective on May 16, 2022, which represented a significantly expanded lease and services agreement to provide enhanced infrastructure and comprehensive facility services supporting the NP Partner and the U.S. Government in their humanitarian aid missions. The Expanded Humanitarian Contract provided for a significant scope expansion and term extension for the continuation of services provided under the agreement that originated in March 2021. The Expanded Humanitarian Contract operates with similar structure to the Company’s existing government services contracts, which are centered around minimum revenue commitments supported by the United States Government. Additionally, the Expanded Humanitarian Contract includes variable services revenue that will align with monthly community population. The minimum revenue commitments, which consist of annual recurring lease revenue and nonrecurring infrastructure enhancement revenue, provide for a minimum annual revenue contribution of approximately $390 million and is fully committed over its initial contract term. The services revenue component provides for a maximum initial annual total contract value of approximately $575 million. 
Our NP Partner depends on the U.S. government and its funding. Any impasse or delay in reaching a federal budget agreement, debt ceiling or government shutdowns, and the subsequent lack of funding to the applicable government entity, could result in material payment delays, payment reductions or contract terminations. The government may terminate this contract with our NP Partner for convenience; in the event this should occur, our NP Partner may terminate its agreement with us for convenience. 
Regulatory and Environmental Compliance
Our business and the businesses of the Company’s customers can be affected significantly by federal, state, municipal and local laws and regulations relating to the natural resource and mining industries, food safety and environmental protection. The Company incurs significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations in operating its business. However, changes in these laws, including more stringent regulations and increased levels of enforcement of these laws and regulations, or new interpretations thereof, and the development of new laws and regulations could impact the Company’s business and result in increased compliance or operating costs associated with its or its customers’ operations. 
In addition, our customers include U.S. government contractors, which means that we may, indirectly, be subject to various statutes and regulations applicable to doing business with the U.S. government. U.S. government contracts and grants normally contain additional requirements that may increase our costs of doing business, reduce our profits, and expose us to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions. If we fail to maintain compliance with these requirements, our contracts may be subject to termination, and we may be subject to financial and/or other liability under its contracts or under the Federal Civil False Claims Act (the “False Claims Act”).
To the extent that these laws and regulations impose more stringent requirements or increased costs or delays upon the Company’s customers in the performance of their operations, the resulting demand for the Company’s services by those customers may be adversely affected. Moreover, climate change laws or regulations could increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for natural resources, which could reduce the Company’s customers’ demand for its services. The Company cannot predict changes in the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations, how these laws and regulations may be interpreted or the effect changes in these laws and regulations may have on the Company or its customers or on our future operations or earnings. The Company also cannot predict the extent to which new laws and regulations will be adopted or whether such new laws and regulations may impose more stringent or costly restrictions on its customers or its operations.
Human Capital
The Company’s key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop talent to deliver on the Company’s strategy. To support these objectives, the Company’s human resources programs are designed to: keep employees safe and healthy; enhance the Company’s culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more 

19



inclusive; acquire and retain diverse talent; reward and support employees through competitive pay and benefit programs; develop talent to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions; and facilitate internal talent mobility to create a high-performing workforce. 
​
The Company employed approximately 921 people as of December 31, 2022. Our workforce is comprised of all full-time employees. Of the total population as of December 31, 2022, approximately 518 of our employees worked in the HFS – South segment, approximately 29 of our employees worked in the HFS – Midwest segment, no employees worked in the TCPL Keystone segment, approximately 288 of our employees worked in the Government segment, and approximately 26 of our employees worked in the All Other segment. The remaining 60 employees worked in Corporate. None of the Company’s employees are unionized or members of collective bargaining arrangements.
​
The Company focuses on the following in managing its human capital:
​
•Health and safety: We have a safety program that focuses on implementing management systems, policies and training programs and performing assessments to see that workers are trained properly, and that injuries and incidents are prevented. All of our employees are empowered with stop-work authority which enables them to immediately stop any unsafe or potentially hazardous working condition or behavior they may observe. We utilize a mixture of indicators to assess the safety performance of our operations, including total recordable injury rate, preventable motor vehicle incidents and corrective actions. We also recognize outstanding safety behaviors through us at the local community level. Importantly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, our continuing focus on health and safety enabled us to preserve business continuity without sacrificing our commitment to keeping our colleagues safe.
​
•Employee wellness: The Company’s Safe & Healthy program is a comprehensive approach to wellness that encourages healthy behaviors and is intended to raise morale, productivity, and overall employee engagement. The program includes a health assessment, no cost preventive care through the medical plan, two personal paid days off to be used for physical and mental health, tobacco cessation support through our medical insurance carrier, and an employee assistance program. Approximately 40% of eligible employees participated in the Health & Safety program in 2022.
​
•Diversity & Inclusion (“D&I”): Inclusion is how we foster an environment where various backgrounds are celebrated and encouraged to grow and learn by valuing the skills and expertise a diverse workforce provides. We believe that an inclusive and a diverse team is key to the success of our culture and aim to drive D&I initiatives. The Company’s D&I initiatives are operationalized through three core elements: (1) senior management’s endorsement of and alignment with the programs; (2) focused efforts in increasing diversity in the talent pipeline and our hiring; (3) creating an inclusive work environment where differences are welcomed. In addition, the Company has made hiring and supporting veterans and minorities, especially in leadership roles, a priority. The Company analyzes diversity in the workforce on at least an annual basis and develops action plans from the results to spark dialogue among employees and leaders in an effort to build a more inclusive, diverse and empowered culture at the Company. As of December 31, 2022, women constituted approximately 41% of our workforce and self-identified racial or ethnic minorities represented 35% of our workforce. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion are core to our culture, and we believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success. 
​
•Compensation programs and employee benefits: Our compensation and benefits programs provide a package designed to attract, retain and motivate employees. In addition to competitive base salaries, the Company provides a variety of short-term, long-term, and commission-based incentive compensation programs to reward performance relative to key metrics. We offer comprehensive benefit options including retirement savings plans, medical insurance, prescription drug benefits, dental insurance, vision insurance, accident and critical illness insurance, life and disability insurance, health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, legal insurance, auto/home insurance and identity theft insurance. 
​

20



•Employee experience and retention: To evaluate our employee experience and retention efforts, we monitor a number of employee measures, such as employee retention. To provide an open and frequent line of communication for all employees, we encourage staff meetings at every community. 
​
•Training and development: The Company is committed to the continued development of its people. We aim for all applicable new hires to attend new hire orientation training within 90 days of hire. Additionally, we offer a wide array of training solutions (classroom, hands-on and e-learning) for our employees. In 2022, our employees enhanced their skills through training, including safety training, leadership training and equipment-related training from our suppliers. Our performance process encourages performance and development check-ins throughout the year to provide for development at all levels across the Company.
