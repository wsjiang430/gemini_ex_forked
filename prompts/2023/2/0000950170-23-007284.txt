 Item 1. Business
 Business Overview
 Ascent Solar Technologies, Inc. (“Ascent” or the "Company") was incorporated on October 18, 2005 from the separation by ITN Energy Systems, Inc. (“ITN”) of its Advanced Photovoltaic Division and all of that division’s key personnel, core technologies, and certain trade secrets and royalty free licenses to use in connection with the manufacturing, developing marketing, and commercializing Copper-Indium-Gallium-diSelenide (“CIGS”) photovoltaic (“PV”) products.
We are an American solar technology company that manufactures and sells PV solar modules that are flexible, durable, and possess attractive power to weight and power to area performance. Our technology provides renewable power solutions to high-value production and specialty solar markets where traditional rigid solar panels are not suitable, including aerospace, agrivoltaics, and niche manufacturing/construction sectors. We operate in these target markets because they have highly specialized needs for power generation and offer attractive pricing due to the significant technological requirements.
We believe the value proposition of Ascent’s proprietary solar technology not only aligns with the needs of customers in our target markets, but also overcomes many of the obstacles other solar technologies face in these unique markets. Ascent designs and develops finished products for end users in these areas and collaborates with strategic partners to design and develop custom integrated solutions for products like airships and fixed-wing UAVs. Ascent sees significant overlap in the needs of end users across some of these markets and believes it can achieve economies of scale in sourcing, development, and production in commercializing products for these customers.
 The integration of Ascent's solar modules into space, near space, and aeronautic vehicles with ultra-lightweight and flexible solar modules is an important market opportunity for the Company. Customers in this market have historically required a high level of durability, high voltage and conversion efficiency from solar module suppliers, and we believe our products are well suited to compete in this premium market.
 Product History
 In March 2008, we demonstrated initial operating capacity of our first production line by beginning production trials as an end-to-end integrated process. By July 2009, we obtained independent verification by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (“NREL”) that our modules of approximately 15 centimeters wide by 30 centimeters long measured 10.4% in conversion efficiency, which, by October 2009, NREL further verified our achievement of a manufacturing milestone of 14.0% cell efficiency as well as a peak efficiency of 11.4% for our CIGS modules. In October 2010, we completed internal qualification testing of a flexible packaging solution which successfully passed the rigorous standard of one thousand (1,000) hours of damp heat testing (85% relative humidity and 85° C temperature) guideline set forth by International Electrotechnical Commission (“IEC”) 61646 standards for performance and long-term reliability of thin film solar modules. And in December 2010, we achieved 12.1% module efficiency on the same form factor.
 In February 2010, three of our product configurations were certified by an independent laboratory on a variety of U.S. Department of Defense (“DOD”) rugged standards known as MIL-STD-810G. In October 2010, we completed full external certification under IEC 61646 at an independent laboratory of a two-meter module. Achieving this certification is required for building integrated photovoltaic (“BIPV”) and building applied photovoltaic (“BAPV”) applications used in commercial, industrial and residential rooftop markets.
In March 2016, the Company announced a major breakthrough of our high-voltage superlight bare modules, achieving a power-to-weight ratio of 1,700 watts per kilogram at AM0 environment. What we believe is the “best-in-class” specific power is crucial to the aerospace industry where every pound of weight reduction would translate to incremental cost savings or increased in payloads. In December 2016, Ascent was selected by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (“JAXA”) as part of their next round of evaluations for providing solar technology for an upcoming mission to Jupiter, as well as to address additional missions. This decision followed an earlier round of investigation with promising results, during which the Company's flexible, monolithically integrated CIGS solar module was subjected to environmental extremes and continued to operate well. During the first phase of JAXA's evaluation, Ascent's PV was successfully tested below -146°C (-231°F) and up to +190°C (+374 °F), and to only 4% of the sunlight generally received in earth's orbit. In addition, JAXA has subjected Ascent's PV to radiation and mechanical testing.
 During the third quarter of 2017, Ascent Solar demonstrated its breadth of capabilities at the US Special Operations Command (“SOCOM”) exclusive Technical Experimentation (“TE”) 17-3 Event in Washington, DC. SOCOM is tasked, by

the Department of Defense (“DoD”), with providing Special Operations Forces (“SOF”) with the latest war fighting technology available; in support of this effort, SOCOM sponsors an annual TE event. In July of 2017, SOCOM requested the participation of companies who have proficiency in the areas of Satellite Communication (“SATCOM”) and Unattended Ground Sensors (“UGS”) for a TE event. Ascent Solar was selected to participate on the basis and recognition that one of the primary issues facing the DoD today is the ability to power all of their war fighting technology. Ascent’s diverse line-up of rugged and lightweight portable solar products offers the potential for the DoD to generate unattended ongoing power, which could save lives and increase the efficiency of the war fighting effort. Ascent received an assessed score of a capability that has “high potential for SOF use with few limitations”.
During the third quarter of 2018, Ascent Solar was once again selected to demonstrate its breadth of capabilities at the SOCOM exclusive TE 18-3 Event in Washington, DC. In July of 2018, SOCOM requested the participation of companies who have proficiency in the areas of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (SUAS) and Mobility for the TE event.
During 2021, the ASTI team further advanced product acceptance into the highly stringent space market with demonstrated solar module survivability under the guidance of NASA Marshal Space Flight Center (MSFC) MISSE X flight experiment on the International Space Station (ISS), advancing our Technology Readiness Level (TRL) to 6, with subsequent flights in 2022-23, both NASA and commercial, intended to achieve TRL 7. TRL 8 is commonly accepted as space qualified. Also during 2021, the ASTI team was able to utilize an ultra-thin lamination made from the coating material used during MISSE X to build custom modules for a customer to be tested for a future flight.
 On September 15, 2021, the Company entered into a Long-Term Supply and Joint Development Agreement (“JDA”) with TubeSolar AG (“TubeSolar”), a significant existing stakeholder in the Company. Under the terms of the JDA, the Company will produce, and TubeSolar will purchase, thin-film PV foils (“PV Foils”) for use in TubeSolar’s solar modules for agricultural photovoltaic (“APV”) applications that require solar foils for its production. Under the JDA, the Company will receive up (i) to $4 million of non-recurring engineering (“NRE”) fees, (ii) up to $13.5 million of payments upon achievement of certain agreed production and cost structure milestones, and (iii) product revenues from sales of PV Foils to TubeSolar. The JDA has no fixed term, and may only be terminated by either party for breach.
The Company and TubeSolar have also jointly established a subsidiary company in Germany, in which TubeSolar holds a minority stake of 30% (the “JV”). The purpose of the JV is to establish and operate a PV manufacturing facility in Germany that will produce and deliver PV Foils exclusively to TubeSolar. Until the JV facility is fully operational, PV Foils will be manufactured in the Company’s existing facility in Thornton, Colorado. The parties expect to jointly develop next generation tooling for use in manufacturing PV Foils at the JV facility. The Company purchased 17,500 shares of the JV for 1 Euro per share, on November 10, 2021.
 Due to the high durability enabled by the monolithic integration employed by our technology, the capability to customize modules into different form factors and what we believe is the industry leading light weight and flexibility provided by our modules, we believe that the potential applications for our products are extensive, including integrated solutions anywhere that may need power generation such as portable power solutions, vehicles in space or in flight or dual-use installations on agricultural land and has developed the following ways to utilize this technology:
 •High-voltage SuperLight thin-film CIGS PV blankets. These 50W, fully laminated, flexible blankets were manufactured using a new process that was optimized for high performance in near-space conditions at elevated temperatures, and are custom designed for easy modular integration into series and parallel configurations to achieve the desired voltage and current required for such application.
 •USB-based portable power systems with the XD series. The first product introduced was the XD-12 which, like previous products, is a folding, lightweight, easily stowable, PV system with USB power regulation. Unique to this generation of PV portable power is more PV power (12 Watts) and a 2.0 Amp smart USB output to enable the XD-12 to charge most smartphones, tablets, and USB-enabled devices as fast as a wall outlet. The enhanced smart USB circuit works with the device to be charged so that the device can determine the maximum power it is able to receive from the XD-12 and ensures the best possible charging performance directly from the sun.
 •Micro-module for a space customer, approximately 12.8mm x 50mm (0.5in x 2.0in) in size that is ideal for both laboratory-scale environmental testing, and for subsequent integration into flight experiments.
 •Ultra-light modules with substrate material used by a European based customer for their lighter-than-air, helium-filled airship project. In 2019, we completed a repeat order from the same customer who had since established its airship 


development operation in the US. In 2020, we received a third and enlarged order from the same customer and completed the order in the second quarter of 2021. Most recently, in the 4th quarter of 2021 we received a fourth order that was shipped in 2022.
 •Ultra-lightweight, flexible PV modules used in the flight of a production version of the Silent Falcon Unmanned Aircraft Systems
 •Small area test cells and large, 19.5cm x 30cm monolithically integrated modules, all on a very thin, 25-micron (0.001 inch) plastic substrate to be used in JAXA’s solar sail deployment demonstration project. The 19.5cm x 30cm module is a custom design to match the anticipated deployment mechanism and PV layout for the final Jovian spacecraft. 
 Commercialization and Manufacturing Strategy
 We manufacture our products by affixing a thin CIGS layer to a flexible, plastic substrate using a large format, roll-to-roll process that permits us to fabricate our flexible PV modules in an integrated sequential operation. We use proprietary monolithic integration techniques which enable us to form complete PV modules with little to no costly back-end assembly of inter-cell connections. Traditional PV manufacturers assemble PV modules by bonding or soldering discrete PV cells together. This manufacturing step typically increases manufacturing costs and, at times, proves detrimental to the overall yield and reliability of the finished product. By reducing or eliminating this added step, using our proprietary monolithic integration techniques, we believe we can achieve cost savings in, and increase the reliability of, our PV modules.
Advantages of CIGS on a Flexible Plastic Substrate
 Thin film PV solutions differ based on the type of semiconductor material chosen to act as a sunlight absorbing layer, and also on the type of substrate on which the sunlight absorbing layer is affixed. To the best of our knowledge, we believe we are the only company in the world currently focused on commercial scale production of PV modules using CIGS on a flexible, plastic substrate with monolithic integration. We utilize CIGS as a semiconductor material because, at the laboratory level, it has a higher demonstrated cell conversion efficiency than amorphous silicon (“a-Si”) and cadmium telluride (“CdTe”). We also believe CIGS offers other compelling advantages over both a-Si and CdTe, including:
 •CIGS versus a-Si:  Although a-Si, like CIGS, can be deposited on a flexible substrate, its conversion efficiency, which already is generally much lower than that of CIGS, measurably degrades when it is exposed to ultraviolet light, including natural sunlight. To mitigate such degradation, manufacturers of a-Si solar cells are required to implement measures that add cost and complexity to their manufacturing processes.
 •CIGS versus CdTe:  Although CdTe modules have achieved conversion efficiencies that are generally comparable to CIGS in production, we believe CdTe has never been successfully applied to a flexible substrate on a commercial scale. We believe the use of CdTe on a rigid, transparent substrate, such as glass, is unsuitable for a number of our applications. We also believe CIGS can achieve higher conversion efficiencies than CdTe in production.
 We believe our choice of substrate material further differentiates us from other thin-film PV manufacturers. We believe the use of a flexible, lightweight, insulating substrate that is easier to install provides clear advantages for our target markets, especially where rigid substrates are unsuitable. We also believe our use of a flexible, plastic substrate provides us significant cost advantages because it enables us to employ monolithic integration techniques on larger components, which we believe are unavailable to manufacturers who use flexible, metal substrates. Accordingly, we are able to significantly reduce part count, thereby reducing the need for costly back end assembly of inter cell connections. As the only company, to our knowledge, focused on the commercial production of PV modules using CIGS on a flexible, plastic substrate with monolithic integration, we believe we have the opportunity to address the aerospace, agrivoltaics and other weight-sensitive markets with transformational high quality, value added product applications. It is these same unique features and our overall manufacturing process that enable us to produce extremely robust, light and flexible products.
 Competitive Strengths
 We believe we possess a number of competitive strengths that provide us with an advantage over our competitors.
 •We are a pioneer in CIGS technology with a proprietary, flexible, lightweight, high efficiency PV thin film product that positions us to penetrate a wide range of attractive high value added markets such as aerospace and agrivoltaics. In addition, we have provided renewable power solutions for off grid, portable power, transportation, defense, and other markets. By applying CIGS to a flexible plastic substrate, we have developed a PV module that is efficient, lightweight and flexible; with the highest power-to-weight ratio in at-scale commercially available solar. 


The market for space and near-space solar power application solutions, agrivoltaics, portable power systems, and transportation integrated applications represent a significant premium market for the Company. Relative to our thin film competitors, we believe our advantage in thin film CIGS on plastic technology provides us with a superior product offering for these strategic market segments.
 •We have the ability to manufacture PV modules for different markets and for customized applications without altering our production processes. Our ability to produce PV modules in customized shapes and sizes, or in a variety of shapes and sizes simultaneously, without interrupting production flow, provides us with flexibility in addressing target markets and product applications, and allows us to respond quickly to changing market conditions. Many of our competitors are limited by their technology and/or their manufacturing processes to a more restricted set of product opportunities.
 •Our integrated, roll-to-roll manufacturing process and proprietary monolithic integration techniques provide us a potential cost advantage over our competitors. Historically, manufacturers have formed PV modules by manufacturing individual solar cells and then interconnecting them. Our large format, roll-to-roll manufacturing process allows for integrated continuous production. In addition, our proprietary monolithic integration techniques allow us to utilize laser patterning to create interconnects, thereby creating PV modules at the same time we create PV cells. In so doing, we are able to reduce or eliminate an entire back end processing step, saving time as well as labor and manufacturing costs relative to our competitors.
 •Our lightweight, powerful, and durable solar panels provide a performance advantage over our competitors. For applications where a premium is placed on the weight and profile of the product, our ability to integrate our PV modules into portable packages offers the customer a lightweight and durable solution for all their portable electronics.
 •Our proven research and development capabilities position us to continue the development of next generation PV modules and technologies. Our ability to produce CIGS based PV modules on a flexible plastic substrate is the result of a concerted research and development effort that began more than 20 years ago. We continue to pursue research and development in an effort to drive efficiency improvements in our current PV modules and to work toward next generation technologies and additional applications.
 •Our manufacturing process can be differentiated into two distinct functions; a front-end module manufacturing process and a back-end packaging process. Our ability to produce finished unpackaged rolls of CIGS material for shipment worldwide to customers for encapsulation and integration into various products enhances our ability to work with partners internationally and domestically.
 Markets and Marketing Strategy
 We target high-value specialty solar markets including aerospace and agrivoltaics applications. This strategy enables us to fully leverage the unique advantages of our technology, including flexibility, durability and attractive power to weight and power to area performance. It further enables us to offer unique, differentiated solutions in large markets with less competition, and more attractive pricing.
We believe the value proposition of Ascent’s proprietary solar technology not only aligns with the needs of customers in these markets, but also overcomes many of the obstacles other solar technologies face in these unique markets. Ascent has the capability to design and develop finished products for end users in these areas as well as collaborate with strategic partners to design and develop custom integrated solutions for products like airships and fixed-wing UAVs. Ascent sees significant overlap in the needs of end users across some of these verticals and believes it can achieve economies of scale in sourcing, development, and production in commercializing products for these customers.
Competition
 We believe our thin film, monolithically integrated CIGS technology enables us to deliver sleek, lightweight, rugged, high performance solutions to serve these markets as competitors from other thin film and c-Si companies emerge. The landscape of thin film manufacturers encompasses a broad mix of technology platforms at various stages of development and consists of a number of medium and small companies.
 The market for traditional, grid connected PV products is dominated by large manufacturers of c-Si technology, although thin film technology on glass has begun to emerge among the major players. We anticipate that while these large manufacturers may continue to dominate the market with their silicon-based products, thin film manufacturers will likely capture an increasingly larger share of the market, as is evident from the success of First Solar (CdTe).

We believe that our modules offer unique advantages. Their flexibility, low areal density (mass per unit area), and high specific power (power per unit mass) enable use on weight-sensitive applications, such as portable power, conformal aircraft surfaces, high altitude long endurance (HALE) fixed wing and lighter than air (LTA) vehicles, and space applications that are unsuitable for glass-based modules. Innovative product design, customer focused development, and our rapid prototyping capability yield modules that could be integrated into virtually any product to create a source of renewable energy. Whether compared to glass based or other flexible modules, our products offer competitive advantages making them unique in comparison to competing products. We consider PowerFilm Solar, Global Solar, MiaSolé, and Flisom to be our closest competitors in terms of technology in the specialty PV market.
 Research and Development and Intellectual Property
 Our technology was initially developed at ITN beginning in 1994. In early 2006, ITN assigned to us certain CIGS PV-specific technologies, and granted to us a perpetual, exclusive, royalty free, worldwide license to use these technologies in connection with the manufacture, development, marketing and commercialization of CIGS PV to produce solar power. In addition, certain of ITN’s existing and future proprietary process and control technologies, although nonspecific to CIGS PV, were assigned to us. ITN retained the right to conduct research and development activities in connection with PV materials, and we agreed to grant a license back to ITN for improvements to the licensed technologies and intellectual property outside of the CIGS PV field.
 We intend to continue to invest in research and development in order to provide near term improvements to our manufacturing process (including to reduce costs) and products (including improve technology to increase efficiency), as well as to identify next generation technologies relevant to both our existing and potential new markets. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 we incurred approximately $5,975,921 and $4,140,319, respectively, in research, development and manufacturing operations costs, which include research and development incurred in customizing products for customers, as well as manufacturing costs incurred while developing our product lines and manufacturing process. We also plan to continue to take advantage of research and development contracts to fund a portion of this development.
 We protect our intellectual property through a combination of trade secrets and patent protections. We own the following patents:

 Company History
 We were formed in October 2005 from the separation by ITN of its Advanced Photovoltaic Division and all of that division’s key personnel and core technologies. ITN, a private company incorporated in 1994, is an incubator dedicated to the development of thin film, PV, battery, fuel cell and nanotechnologies. Through its work on research and development contracts for private and government entities, ITN developed proprietary processing and manufacturing know-how applicable to PV products generally, and to CIGS PV products in particular. Our Company was established by ITN to commercialize its investment in CIGS PV technologies. In January 2006, ITN assigned to us all its CIGS PV technologies and trade secrets and granted to us a perpetual, exclusive, royalty free worldwide license to use certain of ITN’s proprietary process, control and design technologies in the production of CIGS PV modules. Upon receipt of the necessary government approvals in January 2007, ITN assigned government funded research and development contracts to us and also transferred the key personnel working on the contracts to us.
