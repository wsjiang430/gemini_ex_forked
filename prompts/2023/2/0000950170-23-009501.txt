 Item 1. Business
 Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of novel small molecule product candidates to address a range of inflammatory diseases with significant unmet need. We leverage the substantial experience of our team in immunology to identify important new targets and to develop differentiated therapeutics against these targets. Our clinical product candidates address therapeutic indications with substantial commercial opportunity for novel small molecules. Our lead clinical product candidate, VTX958, is a selective allosteric tyrosine kinase type 2 (TYK2) inhibitor. In August 2022, we announced positive topline data from a Phase 1 single and multiple ascending dose trial of VTX958 in healthy volunteers. We are actively enrolling three distinct Phase 2 trials with VTX958 for patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, active psoriatic arthritis and moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease. We expect to report topline data from the Phase 2 trial of VTX958 in psoriasis in the fourth quarter of 2023, while topline Phase 2 data for VTX958 in psoriatic arthritis and Crohn’s disease are expected in 2024. In addition, we are developing VTX002, a sphingosine 1 phosphate receptor (S1P1R) modulator in Phase 2 development for patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC). We initiated a Phase 2 trial with VTX002 in the fourth quarter of 2021 in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and topline data are expected in the second half of 2023. Our third product candidate, VTX2735, is a peripheral-targeted NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome inhibitor. In June 2022, we announced positive topline data from a Phase 1 single and multiple ascending dose trial of VTX2735 in healthy volunteers. We initiated a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial for VTX2735 in cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS) patients in the first quarter of 2023 and continue to evaluate additional indications for clinical development. In addition to VTX2735, we nominated VTX3232, our lead CNS-penetrant NLRP3 inhibitor, as a clinical development candidate in the fourth quarter of 2021. We plan to initiate a Phase 1 trial of VTX3232 in healthy volunteers in the first half of 2023.

Figure 1: Pipeline of current clinical and preclinical programs
 


VTX958 (TYK2 Inhibitor)
 
VTX958 is an oral, selective allosteric inhibitor of TYK2, an intracellular signaling kinase in the JAK family. The JAK signal transduction and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway is implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. By inhibiting TYK2-mediated signal transduction, VTX958 has the potential to suppress chronic inflammation while avoiding inhibition of other related members of the JAK family, such as JAK1, JAK2 and JAK3, thereby reducing the associated risk of infections and other side effects. This high level of selectivity, which is based on results observed in preclinical studies, underpins a safety profile observed in preclinical studies that is differentiated from first-generation JAK inhibitors. VTX958 was well tolerated in preclinical safety assessments in multiple species. In August 2022, we announced positive topline data from a Phase 1 single and multiple ascending dose trial of VTX958 in healthy volunteers, in which VTX958 was well tolerated and demonstrated durable TYK2 target coverage as measured by target cytokines IL-12, IL-23 and IFNα. Based on these results, we have advanced VTX958 into Phase 2 trials in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and Crohn’s disease, and we are evaluating additional indications

for future clinical development. We expect to report topline data from the Phase 2 trial of VTX958 in psoriasis in the fourth quarter of 2023, while topline Phase 2 data for VTX958 in psoriatic arthritis and Crohn’s disease are expected in 2024.

VTX002 (S1P1R Modulator)
 
VTX002 is an oral, selective peripherally restricted S1P1R modulator designed to have high selectivity for the S1P1 receptor. In a Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers, VTX002 was well tolerated at all doses tested with no serious adverse events. In addition, VTX002 showed a dose-dependent and steady-state reduction in ALC of up to 65%. Reduction in circulating ALCs is recognized as a validated biomarker for efficacy in S1P1-mediated diseases, and S1P1 signaling has been identified as a key regulator of lymphocyte migration from lymph nodes into circulation. The blockade of this axis is emerging as a validated therapeutic approach in controlling aberrant leukocyte migration into the mucosa in inflammatory bowel disease (“IBD"), suggesting clinical potential in UC patients.

Based on these Phase 1 healthy volunteer data, we initiated a Phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled trial with VTX002 in UC patients during the fourth quarter of 2021 and believe that this trial may serve as the first of two pivotal trials required for registration along with an additional Phase 3 trial. We expect to report topline data from the ongoing Phase 2 trial in UC during the second half of 2023. We may also conduct additional clinical trials for VTX002 in other relevant immunology indications.

VTX2735 and VTX3232 (NLRP3 Inhibitor Portfolio)
 
Inflammasomes are multi-protein complexes that sense molecular hallmarks of infection or cellular injury and initiate an appropriate immune response. We plan to harness the therapeutic potential of innate immune modulation with an initial focus on the NLRP3 inflammasome, one of the most widely studied members of the inflammasome family.
 
NLRP3 releases interleukin (IL)-1β when activated. Aberrant NLRP3 activation is implicated in a range of both acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. Although several biologics targeting the downstream cytokine IL-1β have been approved for treatment of autoimmune diseases (such as Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS), Familial Mediterranean Fever, Still’s disease and juvenile idiopathic arthritis), we believe direct targeting of NLRP3 with an oral agent may have efficacy and safety advantages over these currently approved biologics.

VTX2735, our lead peripheral NLRP3 inhibitor candidate, has demonstrated NLRP3 inhibition in cellular assays, in vivo pharmacodynamic activity in an animal model and high oral bioavailability in multiple non-clinical species. In June 2022, we announced positive topline data from a Phase 1 single and multiple ascending dose trial of VTX2735 in healthy volunteers, in which VTX2735 was well tolerated and demonstrated robust and durable inhibition of NLRP3 activity as measured by IL-1β. Based on these results, we initiated a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial with VTX2735 in CAPS patients in the first quarter of 2023.

In addition to VTX2735, we are developing VTX3232, our lead CNS-penetrant NLRP3 inhibitor. We nominated VTX3232 as a clinical development candidate in the fourth quarter of 2021, and we plan to initiate a Phase 1 trial of VTX3232 in healthy volunteers in the first half of 2023.
 
Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe our drug discovery and development expertise has enabled us to identify and advance multiple small molecule product candidates from preclinical studies into clinical trials. Our extensive knowledge of the pathophysiology and biology of immunologic conditions informs our decision-making to advance the scientific and clinical path to demonstrate pharmacological activity and proof-of-concept, with the goal of achieving an efficient timeframe and cost-effective budget. The infrastructure within our discovery and development capabilities includes all aspects of the drug discovery process, such as medicinal and process chemistry, computational chemistry, structural biology, and in vitro and in vivo pharmacology. Our approach to drug discovery and development allows us to work in a seamless and simultaneous manner, rather than in sequential fashion. In our TYK2 inhibitor program, for example, we initiated our Phase 1 trial in March 2021, representing a 25-month timeframe from lead identification to a first-in-human trial.


The key elements of our approach to discovery and development include:
 ▪An iterative lead optimization approach that utilizes rational and empirical drug design, allowing for advancement of our lead compounds and delivering drug candidates with high pre-clinical potency and selectivity for our immunology targets; and
 ▪Relevant screening methods that utilize human cellular assays and human whole blood for our lead optimization assays, including a biomarker-driven approach. We believe that this approach offers the best and most relevant predictor of potency, efficacy and therapeutic window for our compounds in human clinical trials. 
 
We have a diversified pipeline of product candidates, all of which we believe target large, well-established commercial markets. We intend to leverage our drug discovery and development approach and expertise to advance this pipeline, and to apply our knowledge of the immunology market to augment our pipeline through strategic partnerships.

Our Strategy
 
Our goal is to become a leader in developing differentiated product candidates for the immunology market and, ultimately, to address large, well-established commercial markets.

The three key elements to achieve this strategy include:
 
Focusing on the identification and development of differentiated product candidates against high value, validated immunology targets that address efficacy and safety limitations of currently approved drugs and those in development. Specifically, we intend to:
 ▪Maximize the value of VTX958, our selective TYK2 inhibitor, by developing it across multiple inflammatory and autoimmune indications. Our oral TYK2 inhibitor, VTX958, is designed to have high selectivity for TYK2 without detectable inhibition of other JAK isoforms, potentially allowing VTX958 to avoid toxicities associated with these targets. We believe VTX958 has the potential to address a broad range of immune diseases, including psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease and lupus, each of which represents a substantial commercial market. 
 ▪Advance VTX002, our selective S1P1R modulator through clinical development in UC. VTX002 is an oral, selective peripherally restricted S1P1R modulator designed to have high selectivity for S1P1R. We initiated a Phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in UC in the fourth quarter of 2021. We believe this trial may serve as the first pivotal trial required for registration. We are also evaluating the potential for VTX002 in other immune-mediated diseases and disorders with pathophysiology that we believe may be addressed by S1P1R modulation.
 ▪Advance our portfolio of NLRP3 inhibitors, starting with VTX2735, through early clinical development and proof-of-concept studies. Our lead NLRP3 inhibitor, VTX2735, is an oral, selective small molecule inhibitor of NLRP3 that is peripherally restricted and designed for the treatment of systemic inflammatory diseases. We initiated a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study with VTX2735 in CAPS patients in the first quarter of 2023. In addition to VTX2735, we are developing VTX3232, a CNS-penetrant NLRP3 inhibitor, which we believe has potential therapeutic utility for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and MS. VTX3232 is expected to enter Phase 1 clinical testing in healthy volunteers in the first half of 2023. 
 
Pursuing efficient and informed development of product candidates by fully leveraging the capabilities of our internal small molecule discovery engine and development infrastructure.

All of our pipeline candidates have been discovered and developed by members of our management team, each of whom has deep industry experience, while serving both at Ventyx and at companies that were later acquired by Ventyx (e.g., Oppilan Pharma Ltd. (“Oppilan”) and Zomagen Biosciences Ltd. (“Zomagen”)), including Dr. Raju Mohan, our chief executive officer. Our goal is to continue to leverage this infrastructure and expertise as we identify new, validated and high-priority inflammatory and immune disease candidates to continue building our pipeline portfolio and advancing new candidates through preclinical and into clinical development.
 

Entering into strategic partnerships that may expand our programs to maximize worldwide commercial potential of our product candidates.
 
All of our pipeline candidates have been discovered and developed by members of our management team while serving both at Ventyx and at companies that were later acquired by Ventyx (e.g., Oppilan and Zomagen). As a result, we currently hold worldwide rights to each product candidate. We may opportunistically evaluate and enter into strategic partnerships around certain product candidates, targets, geographies, or disease areas to expand the potential of our product candidates around the world.

Our Product Candidates
 
VTX958 (Tyrosine Kinase Type 2 (TYK2) Inhibitor)
 
Summary Overview of VTX958
 
VTX958 is an oral, selective clinical-stage inhibitor of TYK2, an intracellular signaling kinase in the JAK family that regulates chronic inflammation in immune-mediated diseases. In preclinical studies, VTX958 inhibited only TYK2 and avoided inhibition of other related members of the JAK family (JAK1, JAK2, and JAK3). The inhibition of JAK1, JAK2, and JAK3 are associated with heightened risk of infections and other side effects.

VTX958 has been designed to have a selectivity profile that positions it as a potential therapeutic for multiple autoimmune diseases with large commercial markets and high unmet medical need, such as psoriasis, IBD, psoriatic arthritis and lupus.
 
Proof-of-concept for the TYK2 inhibitor mechanism was established by Bristol Myers Squibb’s (“BMS”) TYK2 inhibitor, Sotyktu. In two Phase 3 trials in psoriasis patients, Sotyktu demonstrated significantly greater efficacy than Amgen’s Otezla (apremilast, a small molecule inhibitor of PDE4) as measured by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)-75 scores (indicating a 75% reduction in PASI).

VTX958 may be able to demonstrate a more attractive clinical profile than Sotyktu because the selectivity profile of VTX958 may allow us to explore relatively higher clinical doses and exposures. In August 2022, we announced positive topline data from a Phase 1 single and multiple ascending dose trial of VTX958 in healthy volunteers, in which VTX958 was well tolerated and demonstrated potentially class-leading TYK2 target coverage as measured by target cytokines IL-12, IL-23 and IFNα. Based on these results, we have advanced VTX958 into Phase 2 trials in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and Crohn’s disease, and we are evaluating additional indications for future clinical development. We expect to report topline data from the Phase 2 trial of VTX958 in psoriasis in the fourth quarter of 2023, while topline Phase 2 data for VTX958 in psoriatic arthritis and Crohn’s disease are expected in 2024.

Market Opportunity
 
TYK2-mediated therapies have the potential to address multiple diseases, each of which represents a substantial commercial market (Figure 2). The figure below summarizes the prevalence and market potential of each of these indications. We are initially developing VTX958 in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and Crohn’s disease, and we continue to evaluate additional indications for future clinical development.


Figure 2: Potential indications for TYK2-targeted molecules
 


Overview of Psoriasis
 
Our initial indication for VTX958 is in moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease that occurs in about 2%-3% of adults in the U.S. with similar prevalence in Germany, France, Italy and Spain (EU4), and the United Kingdom. About 90% of cases are plaque psoriasis, which is characterized by “plaques”, or raised, red areas of skin covered with a silver or white layer of dead skin cells referred to as “scale”. Psoriatic plaques can appear on any area of the body, but most often appear on the scalp, knees, elbows, trunk and limbs. The plaques are often itchy and sometimes painful.
 
Psoriasis patients are generally characterized as mild, moderate or severe, depending on the extent of involvement based on body surface area (BSA). Moderate-to-severe psoriasis is typically defined as involvement of more than 5% of the BSA and accounts for approximately 25% to 30% of the psoriasis patient population. We believe there are approximately 1.2 million moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients being treated in the U.S. and a similar population in the EU4 and the United Kingdom. Global revenues for approved branded products treating psoriasis totaled approximately $24 billion in 2021.

Treatment Paradigm in Psoriasis
 
Numerous topical and systemic therapies are available for the treatment of psoriasis. Treatment modalities are chosen on the basis of disease severity, relevant comorbidities, cost and convenience, efficacy and evaluation of individual patient response. Moderate-to-severe psoriasis requires phototherapy or systemic therapies, such as retinoids, methotrexate, cyclosporine, apremilast or biologic immune modifying agents. However, current treatments for moderate-to-severe psoriasis are often associated with toxicity and/or limited efficacy or loss of efficacy over time, and patients remain undertreated, representing a high unmet medical need.
 
Phototherapy acts through multiple mechanisms, including apoptosis of inflammatory cells and increasing production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. However, patients might be reluctant to use phototherapy due to significant insurance and co-pay costs and photosensitivity.
 
Treatment with non-biologic systemic therapy, such as methotrexate or apremilast, is also limited. According to Decision Resources Group, non-biologic systemic therapy represents approximately 8% of patients worldwide and 11% of patients in the U.S. The use of methotrexate has declined due to concerns about side effects and mandatory routine monitoring. Otezla’s reported 2021 annual sales totaled $2.2 billion despite limitations on its use in moderate-to-severe patients, modest symptomatic improvement and frequent adverse events.

Biologic agents used in the treatment of psoriasis include the anti-TNF agents adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab and certolizumab pegol; the anti-IL-12/IL-23 antibody ustekinumab; the anti-IL-17 antibodies secukinumab and ixekizumab; the anti-IL-17 receptor antibody brodalumab; and the anti-IL-23 antibodies guselkumab, tildrakizumab and risankizumab. Treatment with biologics remains highly restricted. In the U.S., less than 20% of moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients, equivalent to approximately 6% of all psoriasis patients, are on biologic therapy. While efficacy of injectable biologics can be quite robust, with PASI-75 scores of recent approved biologics ranging as high as 61%-91%, the uptake of biologics has remained limited due to multiple factors, including the fact that they are indicated only for use in moderate-to-severe patients, their significant cost and high patient co-pays, reimbursement and access restrictions, perceived risk of side effects, and patient reluctance and fear of injections. Moreover, there are safety concerns, which limit the adoption and utility of these biologic therapies. For example, there is a concern that all TNFα inhibitors have the

potential to activate latent infections, such as tuberculosis, and increased rates of infection have been seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab.

Oral TYK2 inhibitors, such as VTX958, inhibit the IL-12, IL-23 and Type I interferon pathways, which are modulated by biologic agents, such as ustekinumab, guselkumab, tildrakizumab and risankizumab. Thus far, these biologic agents are among the most effective in the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis with PASI-75 scores at the upper end of reported data and PASI-90 scores approaching or exceeding 80% after 48-weeks or more of treatment. While newer biologics are typically regarded as safer than earlier-generation therapies, limitations include the need for injections, high cost of therapy, hypersensitivity reactions and long half-life in the case of an infection, providing an opportunity for safe and effective oral agents that target the same pathways. Bristol Myers Squibb’s Sotyktu (deucravacitinib) received FDA approval in September 2022 and is the first approved oral TYK2 inhibitor for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

Rationale for Targeting TYK2
 
Psoriasis pathogenesis is characterized by keratinocyte hyperplasia due to immunologic dysregulation predominant in T helper type 1 (Th1) and T helper type 17 (Th17) immune response signaling, which is driven by IL-12 and IL-23, respectively. Antibodies targeting IL-12 and IL-23 have been approved for the treatment of psoriasis, validating the therapeutic strategy of Th1/Th17 inhibition.

The JAK-STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) DNA-binding pathways are required for molecular signaling of many cytokines that are important for the differentiation and effector functions of T helper cells, including, but not limited to, IL-12 and IL-23. There are four members of the JAK family—JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2—all of which partner in cytokine receptor signaling (Figure 4).

Figure 4: Role of JAK family protein in cytokine receptor signaling pathways
 


As shown in Figure 4, JAK kinases are associated with the intracellular domains of cytokine receptors and transduce receptor-mediated signals via JAK-STAT pathways. JAK1 has the broadest receptor specificity, with the ability to pair with all three other JAK family members for signal transduction. JAK2 homodimers play an essential role in cytokines essential for hematopoietic homeostasis, such as GM-CSF and EPO signaling. JAK3 mainly pairs with JAK1 for signal transduction, while TYK2 pairs with either JAK1 for IFNα/β signaling or with JAK2 for IL-12/23 signaling.

Non-specific JAK inhibitors cause undesirable side effects due to the pleiotropic function of the cytokines they regulate. For example, Pfizer’s pan-JAK inhibitor Xeljanz (tofacitinib) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of various psoriatic diseases. However, due to its safety profile, it has been approved only for use in psoriatic arthritis, not psoriasis.

Inhibition of JAK1 affects a broad spectrum of immune functions, including: (1) the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10; (2) the IFNy pathway, which is important in pathogen defense; and (3) the cytokines IL-6, IL-10 and IL-22, which have important roles in maintaining mucosal barrier function. The most common serious treatment-related adverse event associated with JAK1 inhibitors is infection.
 
Inhibition of JAK2, which disrupts thrombopoiesis and hemopoiesis, is a major safety concern for first-generation JAK inhibitors. Second-generation JAK inhibitors that do not target JAK2, such as AbbVie’s Rinvoq (upadacitinib) and Eli Lilly’s Olumiant (baricitinib), have improved safety profiles, but safety concerns related to potential for toxicity related to JAK1 inhibition have contributed to black box product label warnings for these therapies from regulatory agencies.


Figure 5: Protective functions of cytokine pathways mediated by JAK1 that are spared by TYK2 inhibition



As shown in Figure 5, JAK1 regulates signaling downstream of many cytokines, including IFNy, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13 and IL-22, which have protective functions.
 We believe a highly selective TYK2 inhibitor with a potentially broad therapeutic window may be a powerful means by which to specifically address IFNα, IL-12 and IL-23-driven disease. Even though TYK2 is activated upon IL-6, IL-10 and IL-22 stimulation, it is essential only for IFNα/β, IL-12 and IL-23 signaling. We believe that a selective TYK2 inhibitor will affect only IFNα, IL-12 and IL-23 stimulated pathways, minimizing the safety concerns that likely arise from inhibition of other JAK kinases.

This hypothesis is supported by multiple genome-wide association studies that have identified human loss-of-function mutations in the TYK2 gene to be a protective factor in a variety of autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis. Immune cells with these mutations are non-responsive to IFNα/β, IL-12 and IL-23 stimulation, but maintain normal responses to IL-10 and IL-6 stimulation. Importantly, individuals with loss-of-function mutations in the TYK2 gene are healthy, without increased risk of infection, indicating selective inhibition of TYK2 may present an optimal balance between reduction of autoimmunity and preservation of anti-pathogen immune function.

All JAK kinases contain a catalytic kinase domain (JH1), where critical phosphoryl transfer reactions responsible for STAT activation occur. All JAK kinases have a second, regulatory pseudokinase domain (JH2), which is autoinhibitory and functions to maintain the kinase domain in an inactive stand-by mode until an appropriate activation signal is received. The kinase domains of JAK family members are highly conserved, making the design of selective inhibitors targeting the established kinase function challenging. The regulatory JH2 domains of the JAK kinases, however, are much less conserved and have structurally distinct binding pockets, making them attractive targets for inhibitor design.

Therefore, we have chosen to exploit these structural differences to design selective allosteric TYK2 inhibitors, typified by VTX958, which bind with high specificity to the JH2 domain of TYK2 and inhibit the kinase via disruption of its essential regulatory role in the signal transduction of TYK2.

We believe TYK2 is validated as a clinical target based on Phase 3 data from two trials of BMS’s FDA-approved TYK2 inhibitor, Sotyktu, in psoriasis, which were conducted head-to-head in comparison to apremilast and placebo. In the two Phase 3 trials, Sotyktu patients dosed at 6mg QD demonstrated superior efficacy at the primary endpoint assessed following 16 weeks of treatment. Sotyktu patients achieved PASI-75 scores of 58.7% and 53.6%, respectively, which represented a statistically significant improvement compared to apremilast’s PASI-75 scores of 35.1% and 40.2%, respectively, and placebo PASI-75 of 12.7% and 9.4% (Table 1).

Competition and Limitations of Current TYK2 Inhibitors
 
There are a number of TYK2 inhibitors with different selectivity profiles currently being investigated in clinical trials for multiple autoimmune indications. These inhibitors can be divided roughly into two groups: (1) active kinase domain inhibitors, including clinical-stage compounds, such as Priovant’s brepocitinib and Galapagos’ GLPG3667, and (2) allosteric inhibitors, including Sotyktu from BMS, TAK-279 from Takeda and ESK-001 from Alumis, Inc. (Table 2).

Table 2: Publicly disclosed clinical-stage TYK2 inhibitor programs
 

 | COMPANY | COMPOUND | STAGE | NOTE:

Allosteric | BMS | Sotyktu | Approved | 
 | Takeda | TAK-279 | Phase 2 | 
 | Alumis | ESK-001 | Phase 2 | 

 
Designing selective JAK inhibitors that directly and specifically inhibit the intended kinase function is challenging due to the structural similarity between kinase domain (JH1) ATP binding pockets of JAK family members.

Allosteric inhibitors that bind to the regulatory pseudokinase JH2 domain have better selectivity for TYK2, but high homology between the JAK1 and TYK2 JH2 domains remains a challenge in designing selective agents. For example, while Sotyktu is a binder to the TYK2 JH2 domain, it also shows sub-nanomolar potency in a JAK1-JH2 binding assay. This interaction with the JAK1-JH2 pathway is reflected in downstream signaling in IL-10 and IL-6 stimulation assays. We believe that less selective TYK2 inhibitors may produce toxicity arising from off-target effects when used at higher doses. Moreover, dose constraints on less selective compounds may result in sub-optimal inhibition of key pathways (i.e., IL-12, IL-23) that are relevant to targeting autoimmune conditions, such as psoriasis and IBD, and, ultimately, yield lower efficacy, particularly in those indications in which increased efficacy may require elevated dose levels of a TYK2 inhibitor.

Our Solution: VTX958
 
VTX958 is an oral, selective allosteric inhibitor of TYK2 with a selective profile for TYK2 over other members of the JAK family. VTX958 was designed to inhibit IL-12, IL-23 and Type 1 interferon (IFNα/β) by binding selectively to the pseudokinase JH2 regulatory domain of TYK2, without inhibiting the analogous domains of JAK1, JAK2, or JAK3.

We believe that TYK2 inhibitors represent a new class of oral drugs that target pathways only partially addressed by current IL-12/IL-23 biologic therapies. A selective allosteric TYK2 inhibitor may play a critical role in offering a well-balanced therapy that: (1) mitigates harmful immune responses in these diseases while preserving protective immunity against pathogens; (2) avoids risk of injection-related reactions, including hypersensitivity; (3) overcomes patient reluctance to injections, thus potentially minimizing discontinuation rates; and (4) may be better positioned to address the cost and access limitations frequently associated with biologic therapies.

We have internally conducted pseudokinase domain binding assays comparing VTX958 and Sotyktu and have demonstrated that VTX958 has > 4,000-fold selectivity for its binding to the TYK2 JH2 domain as compared to its binding to the JAK1 JH2 domain. Sotyktu, by comparison, has high affinity for both TYK2 JH2 and JAK1 JH2 domains, binding with sub-nanomolar affinity to both domains with 48-fold selectivity. Our internal studies showed that VTX958 is approximately 80-fold more selective compared to Sotyktu in its binding affinity for the TYK2 JH2-allosteric domain (Table 3a) and we believe that this selectivity is also reflected in the higher selectivity of VTX958 for TYK2 relative to Sotyktu in cellular cytokine assays.

 | IL-4 PBMC | >10,000 nM | 249 nM 
 | IL-6 PBMC | >10,000 nM | 464 nM 

 
VTX958 shows high selectivity for TYK2-mediated cytokine pathways over JAK1-mediated pathways in multiple cellular cytokine stimulation assays conducted in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), as shown in Table 3b, and in human whole blood (WB). This selective effect on TYK2-driven pathways differentiates VTX958 from more advanced TYK2 inhibitors in clinical development. Importantly, VTX958 was shown to have no detectable effect on JAK1-driven cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-10, whereas Sotyktu has been shown, by us and by others, to inhibit activity on these pathways from 20-500 nM.

We believe VTX958 has the potential to be a therapeutic for multiple autoimmune diseases with large commercial markets and high unmet medical need, such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease and potentially other indications.
 
Phase 1 Trial of VTX958 in Healthy Volunteers
 
Overview
 
The Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) trial of VTX958 was a two-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PD) of single and multiple ascending doses. The study enrolled 96 adult healthy volunteers across SAD cohorts up to 500 mg and MAD cohorts up to 350 mg BID (twice a day) daily for 14 days.
Safety and Tolerability
 
VTX958 was well tolerated across all seven cohorts in the SAD portion and all five cohorts in the MAD portion of the Phase 1 trial with no discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs). No drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported. All treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were classified as mild. No dose-limiting toxicities were identified and no dose-dependent trend in the frequency of TEAEs was observed. Additionally, there were no significant effects on hematological parameters, lipids/triglycerides and CPK laboratory values.

Exposure and Target Coverage
 
In both the SAD and the MAD portions of the trial, a dose-dependent increase in exposure was observed through all cohorts. In the MAD portion of the trial, VTX958 achieved TYK2 IC50 and IC90 coverage for up to 24 hours. The exposures achieved by VTX958 demonstrated potential class-leading coverage of TYK2 IC50 and IC90 and its target cytokines, IL-12, IL-23 and IFNα.
Figure 6: Exposure and Target Coverage Across All MAD Cohorts at Day 10
 


Pharmacodynamic Effects
 
In the MAD portion of the trial, PD activity was measured by the impact on TYK2-mediated target genes following in vivo IFNα challenge, and by IFNg response to ex vivo IL-12/IL-18 stimulation of blood samples derived from all dosing cohorts. In both the in vivo IFNα challenge PD assay, as well as the ex vivo IFNg response assay, VTX958 demonstrated robust dose-dependent PD activity, thereby confirming its impact on TYK2-mediated pathways and providing direct in vivo evidence of target engagement.
Figure 7: In Vivo IFNα Challenge
 


IFNα administration activates interferon-inducible genes, including CXCL10, ISG20 and IFI27, which display diverse onset, amplitude and resolution kinetics. VTX958 demonstrated potent exposure-PD activity on all three genes. The response was dose-related across all cohorts tested.

VTX958 demonstrated substantial dose-dependent inhibition of IFNg at all time-points in response to IL-12/IL-18 dual stimulation.
 
Clinical Development Plan for VTX958
 
Based on these positive Phase 1 results, we have advanced VTX958 into Phase 2 trials in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and Crohn’s disease, and we are evaluating additional indications for future clinical development. We expect to report topline data from the Phase 2 trial of VTX958 in psoriasis in the fourth quarter of 2023, while topline Phase 2 data for VTX958 in psoriatic arthritis and Crohn’s disease are expected in 2024.
VTX002 (Sphingosine 1 Phosphate Receptor (S1P1R) Modulator)
 
Summary Overview of VTX002
 
VTX002 is an oral, selective, peripherally restricted S1P1R modulator designed to have high selectivity for the S1P1 receptor, which we are developing for the treatment of IBD and other inflammatory indications. UC is our lead indication. S1P1 signaling has been identified as a key regulator of lymphocyte migration from lymph nodes into circulation. The blockade of this axis is an emerging therapeutic approach to control aberrant leukocyte migration into the mucosa in IBD.

In a Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers, VTX002 demonstrated a dose-dependent and steady-state reduction in absolute lymphocyte counts of up to 65%. Reduction in absolute lymphocyte counts is an established biomarker for S1P1-mediated pharmacodynamic effects that correlates with efficacy as demonstrated in multiple Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials conducted by third parties. VTX002 was well tolerated with no serious adverse events. Based on these encouraging results, we initiated a Phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled trial in UC in the fourth quarter of 2021.
 
BMS’ Zeposia (ozanimod) became the first S1P1R modulator approved for treatment of UC in May 2021. However, VTX002’s effects on lymphocyte lowering in our Phase 1 trial, as well as its pharmacokinetic properties that allow for rapid onset of activity and rapid normalization of lymphocyte counts upon discontinuation of therapy, may lead to an improved clinical profile relative to ozanimod. Further, based on the lack of liver function test elevations in our Phase 1 trial and our peripherally restricted drug activity, we believe VTX002 may avoid certain warnings included within the Zeposia label, including those around liver injury and macular edema screening, respectively.

In addition to UC, we may conduct additional trials of VTX002 in other relevant inflammatory conditions that we believe may be responsive to treatment with our oral, selective S1P1R modulator.

Overview of the IBD Market Opportunity
 
IBD is estimated to affect approximately 1,700,000 people in the U.S. and over 6,800,000 people globally. Incidence of IBD has been noted to be increasing in recent years, with CDC reports indicating that patients reporting as IBD sufferers has increased by up to 50% over the previous 15-20 years in the U.S. Diagnosis of IBD is split roughly between two indications: UC and Crohn’s disease (CD). Approximately 30-40% of patients with each disease may be considered to have moderate-to-severe disease and represent the target population for VTX002.

In 2021, the IBD market for all levels of severity was approximately $21 billion globally, with the UC segment representing approximately $7 billion in 2021 sales. The global UC market share is currently majority-held by parenteral biologic agents, led by AbbVie’s Humira and Takeda’s Entyvio, both of which are approved for UC patients with moderately to severely active disease. Market research suggests the IBD commercial market has significant growth potential driven by increasing disease incidence and the emergence of novel oral therapeutics, several of which are expected to potentially seek regulatory approval over the next several years. We believe that the recent label expansion into UC for BMS’ Zeposia, an S1P1R modulator, will facilitate novel oral agents to increase their share of the UC market in future years. We believe projected gains for oral agents are supported by physician and patient general preference for oral administration over injectable biological therapies, high demand for new therapies with competitive clinical profiles and the potential for potent and well-tolerated oral agents to expand the overall treated moderate-to-severe UC population.

We believe that biologics have underpenetrated the UC market in the U.S. because of the aforementioned limitations associated with biologic therapy. While there are more than an estimated 300,000 moderate-to-severe UC patients in the U.S., we currently estimate only about 100,000 or more of this target patient population are on biologic treatments. We believe up to half or more of the U.S. population of UC patients treated with biologics either fail to achieve remission or lose remission over time on their current biologic therapy, representing a segment of patients with high unmet need within the overall addressable moderate-to-severe UC market.


Figure 9: U.S. addressable UC patient population for VTX002
 


Overview of IBD
 
IBD is a complex disease with many contributing factors, including genetic, environmental and immunologic. UC and CD are the two most common forms of IBD and are characterized by dysregulation of lymphocytes contributing to inflammation. Both UC and CD are chronic, relapsing, remitting, inflammatory conditions of the GI tract that begin most commonly during adolescence and young adulthood. UC involves the innermost lining of the large intestine, and symptoms include abdominal pain and diarrhea, frequently with blood and mucus. CD can affect the entire thickness of the bowel wall and all parts of the GI tract from mouth to anus. CD symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea and other more systemic symptoms, such as weight loss, nutritional deficiencies and fever.

Treatment Paradigm in IBD
 
Mild-to-moderate IBD patients are commonly managed with 5-ASA (aminosalicylate) (mainly used in UC), corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents, including azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine. Patients with a more serious initial disease presentation and those who have progressed or are intolerant of earlier line therapies frequently advance to biologic or novel oral medications (Figure 9). The mainstay biologics for treatment of moderate-to-severe UC and/or CD are anti-TNFα biologics (including AbbVie’s Humira, Johnson & Johnson’s Remicade and Simponi, and UCB Pharma’s Cimzia). Recently, treatment paradigms have begun shifting as additional options and more data become available with anti-integrin therapies (particularly Takeda’s Entyvio) gaining traction in UC, and anti-IL-12/IL-23 and anti-IL-23 biologics (namely, Johnson & Johnson’s Stelara and AbbVie’s Skyrizi) frequently being used in CD. BMS’ Zeposia, an S1P1R modulator, was approved for treatment of moderate-to-severe UC in May 2021. Pfizer’s oral JAK inhibitor, Xeljanz, was approved for treatment of UC in 2018, but commercial uptake has been limited due to its “black box” warning for risks, including serious infections, malignancy and thrombosis. AbbVie’s Rinvoq, a next-generation oral JAK inhibitor, received FDA approval for moderately to severely active UC in March 2022, and also carries a black box warning similar to other agents in the JAK class.
 
However, substantial unmet need remains as approved therapies have generally failed to demonstrate a clinical remission effect size exceeding 10-15% relative to placebo in pivotal trials. Moreover, among those patients who do respond to therapy, up to 45-50% may lose response over time, owing to development of neutralizing antibodies or other issues. Modestly stronger remission rates have been reported recently, including in AbbVie’s Phase 3 trials for JAK inhibitor Rinvoq (UC) and anti-IL-23 mAb Skyrizi (risankizumab-rzaa) (CD). These therapies have delivered effect sizes in the 20-30% range, but safety issues associated with the JAK inhibitor class and the need for injections with anti-IL-23 biologics may limit market share potential.


In the UC market, there remains high unmet medical need as approved agents, including AbbVie’s Humira, Takeda’s Entyvio, Pfizer’s Xeljanz, Janssen’s Stelara and BMS’ Zeposia, have achieved clinical remission rates below 20% in registration trials on either the 4-Component Mayo Score or the current standard for approval, the 3-Component Mayo Score. The treatment effect relative to placebo for approved agents has been consistently below 15% among approved UC drugs.

Figure 10: Clinical trial data for approved UC treatments
 


We believe there remains significant demand for well-tolerated and efficacious oral agents for the treatment of moderate-to-severe CD and UC. According to studies, nearly half of patients taking biologic therapies may be expected to experience reduced efficacy over time leading to use of higher doses at substantially higher costs and elevated rates of drug discontinuation. Many moderate-to-severe CD and UC patients refuse or are reluctant to adopt parenteral therapies, which, we believe, has contributed to a significant number of patients receiving sub-optimal care. The relapsing-remitting nature of IBD also may contribute to poor outcomes as patients may seek to discontinue therapies with undesirable or cumbersome administration during periods in which disease symptoms have abated.

Rationale for Targeting S1P1R
 
S1P1R is a clinically validated target, as evidenced by the approval of BMS’ Zeposia (ozanimod) for UC and multiple sclerosis (MS), Novartis’ marketed therapies for MS, Mayzent (siponimod) and Gilenya (fingolimod), Johnson & Johnson’s Ponvory (ponesimod) in MS, and, most recently, positive Phase 3 data for Pfizer’s etrasimod in UC.

S1P1R is a member of the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor family of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). S1P1R is highly expressed on lymphocytes associated with the underlying inflammation of autoimmune diseases. S1P1R modulation causes selective and reversible retention, or sequestration, of circulating white blood cells (lymphocytes) in peripheral lymphoid tissue (such as the lymph nodes) and in the thymus. The sequestration of lymphocytes is achieved by modulating cell migration patterns (known as lymphocyte trafficking), specifically preventing self-targeting, or autoreactive, lymphocyte migration to areas of disease inflammation, which is a major contributor to autoimmune diseases, including UC (Figure 11).


Figure 11: S1P1R modulation results in sequestration of lymphocytes, ameliorating lymphocyte-driven autoimmune diseases
 


Competition and Limitations of Current S1P1R Modulators for IBD
 
In May 2021, ozanimod became the first S1P1R modulator approved for the treatment of UC. In top-line results from a 645-patient, Phase 3 trial in UC, ozanimod showed moderate clinical efficacy with 18.4% of UC patients taking ozanimod achieving clinical remission compared to 6.0% of patients taking placebo. Currently, it is being studied in Phase 3 trials for the treatment of CD. In March 2022, Pfizer announced results of two Phase 3 trials with etrasimod in UC, demonstrating a placebo-adjusted clinical remission rate (induction) of 19.6% in one trial and 9.7% in the other. Etrasimod is also in Phase 2 development for the treatment of CD. Most predecessor S1P1R modulator compounds were developed as treatments for MS and, thus, have high CNS penetration. We believe that this property may contribute to efficacy in MS, but is not desirable in IBD. The clinical safety and efficacy profile of these compounds may be limited by issues, such as hepatotoxicity; inability to dose to upper end of tolerated dose range and therefore suboptimal pharmacodynamic effect; longer half-life in humans (for compounds with active circulating metabolites, such as ozanimod); and heart rate effects (on-target first-dose reduction in heart rate, which can be mitigated by dose titration as we demonstrated in our Phase 1 trial).

Our Solution: VTX002
 
VTX002 is an oral, selective peripherally restricted S1P1R modulator designed to have high specificity for S1P1R with no detectable activity against the S1P2 and S1P3 receptors, which are associated with cardiovascular and pulmonary risks (Figure 12). VTX002 has very low CNS penetration and ocular distribution which, we believe, may reduce the risk of serious complications of S1P1R modulation in CNS, including macular edema.

Figure 12: VTX002 selectivity profile
 


In our Phase 1 trial, VTX002 was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events or notable safety findings. In the therapeutic active dosing range tested, VTX002 showed dose-dependent steady-state reduction in absolute lymphocyte count of up to 65% which we

believe is strongly predictive of likely clinical effect in UC and potentially other conditions. In addition, we established a dose titration schedule in the Phase 1 MAD trial to mitigate known first-dose heart rate effects associated with this class of drugs.

VTX002’s wide therapeutic index allows us to explore the upper end of the dosing range, which may translate into clinical efficacy in certain indications. VTX002 has a half-life of 20 hours and no long-acting active metabolites, which enables a rapid onset of action and rapid recovery from pharmacologic activity compared to other agents, such as ozanimod.
 
Specifically, ozanimod’s activity is achieved largely through circulating active metabolites, which can have an effective half-life of around 11 days (compared to a half-life of approximately 21 hours for ozanimod itself). This extended circulating half-life can lead to a slower time of onset of pharmacologic activity, which may result in a longer time to achieve maximal efficacy. In addition, the extended circulating half-life may introduce potential safety risk in the event of a serious infection because lymphocyte counts may take longer to rebound to normal circulating levels than with a shorter-acting agent, such as VTX002.
 
We believe VTX002 has the potential to be a modulator of S1P1R in multiple, large autoimmune diseases. In addition to UC and MS, S1P1R modulators have previously been evaluated through Phase 2 studies in CD.
 
Summary of VTX002 Phase 1 Clinical Data
 
In the Phase 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled SAD and MAD trials in 88 healthy volunteers, once-daily dosing of VTX002 was well tolerated for up to 28 days. The trials were designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, dose-response, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of VTX002 compared to placebo. There were no serious adverse events reported. No subjects had liver function test elevations, pulmonary function or ocular exam abnormalities, or other notable safety findings, which have been seen with other S1P1R modulators.

Once-daily dosing of VTX002 in the Phase 1 MAD trial demonstrated a half-life of approximately 20 hours and a dose-proportionate exposure after single and multiple doses of VTX002 with steady-state was reached after 4 to 7 days of target-dose exposure.

Figure 13: Phase 1 MAD Results – Pharmacokinetics
 


In the Phase 1 MAD trial, once-daily dosing of VTX002 led to a dose-dependent steady state reduction in mean absolute lymphocyte count of up to 65% (Figure 14). Following the last dose of VTX002 in the MAD cohorts, lymphocyte counts started to return to normal within 72 hours.


Figure 14: Placebo adjusted lymphocyte count in MAD trial of VTX002
 


No clinically significant first-dose reduction in heart rate was observed following treatment with VTX002 at expected therapeutic dose levels following our 7-day titration schedule.
 
Clinical Development Plan for VTX002
 
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we commenced a Phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, which is expected to enroll approximately 180 moderate-to-severe UC patients. The Phase 2 trial, which was designed with FDA input, is a 13-week induction study followed by a 39-week open label extension (OLE). The Phase 2 trial will provide dose/exposure/PD response data for two dose levels and will support dose selection for a potential Phase 3 trial. The primary endpoint at Week 13 is clinical remission as defined by the 3-Component Mayo Score, which evaluates stool frequency, rectal bleeding and endoscopic results. Significant improvement on the 3-Component Mayo Score has been the primary endpoint serving as the basis for approval of recent UC therapies, including ozanimod. Other key planned secondary endpoints include endoscopic and symptomatic improvement measures. We anticipate that this trial may serve as the first pivotal study required for FDA registration. We expect to report topline data from the ongoing Phase 2 trial of VTX002 in UC during the second half of 2023.
VTX2735 and VTX3232 (NLRP3 Inhibitor Portfolio)
 
NLRP3 Inhibitor Portfolio
 
We have multiple programs focused on inhibitors of inflammasomes, multi-protein complexes that sense molecular hallmarks of infection or cellular injury and initiate an appropriate immune response. Inflammasomes have been recognized for their crucial role in host defense against pathogens, but dysregulated inflammasome activation is linked to the development of autoimmune, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases, implicating them in a broad range of inflammatory diseases. These include systemic (i.e., cardiovascular (CV), dermatologic and rheumatic diseases) and CNS (i.e., Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease) diseases (Figure 15).
 
We plan to harness the therapeutic potential of innate immune modulation, with an initial focus on the NLRP3 inflammasome. NLRP3 is the most widely studied member of the inflammasome family with the broadest role in autoimmune dysregulation and thus a high-value target for the treatment of multiple anti-inflammatory diseases.

We are developing a comprehensive portfolio of differentiated NLRP3 inhibitors to address multiple indications driven by aberrant NLRP3 activation. Our lead program, VTX2735, is a peripherally restricted inhibitor of NLRP3. We initiated a Phase 2

proof-of-concept trial for VTX2735 in CAPS patients in the first quarter of 2023. In addition to VTX2735, we are also developing CNS-penetrant NLRP3 inhibitors. We plan to initiate a Phase 1 trial of VTX3232, our lead CNS-penetrant NLRP3 inhibitor, in healthy volunteers in the first half of 2023.

Figure 15: Potential indications for NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors
 


Background on Inflammasomes
 
Inflammasomes are multi-protein signaling complexes that control the inflammatory response and coordinate antimicrobial host defenses. They are activated by a range of pathogen-derived or environmental signals. Detection of these stimuli triggers formation of a large cytoplasmic multimolecular complex that serves to activate caspase 1. Upon activation, caspase 1 cleaves inactive pro-IL-1β into IL-1β. It also cleaves other IL-1 family cytokines, converting inert pro-IL-18 to active IL-18. Caspase 1 also can initiate a cell death process, called pyroptosis, that rapidly releases inflammatory mediators, including, but not limited to, mature IL-1β and IL-18 (Figure 16). These inflammatory mediators recruit additional immune cells that are important to eradicate the infection or cellular injury. However, this feed forward loop, when dysregulated, also forms the basis of many auto-inflammatory diseases.


Figure 16: Role of inflammasomes
 


Rationale for Targeting NLRP3
 
NLRP3 is known to be activated by a range of non-infectious tissue damage signals associated with injury, aging, physical inactivity and obesity. When activated, NLRP3 initiates immune responses and stimulates production of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, as well as pyroptosis. Based on both animal model studies and clinical data, NLRP3 has been shown to be associated with a diverse range of diseases and conditions, including genetic NLRP3-dependent auto-inflammatory diseases (CAPS and related conditions), systemic diseases (cardiovascular, dermatologic and rheumatic conditions) and neuroinflammatory diseases (Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), among others.
 
While the NLRP3 inflammasome historically has been a challenging drug target, the therapeutic potential of NLRP3 inhibitors in autoimmune disease has been validated by clinical and preclinical data and genetic evidence generated by third parties. Several clinical therapies targeting NLRP3-dependent cytokine anti-IL-1β have been approved, providing validation for its role in a broad range of inflammatory disorders. Approved therapies include Ilaris (canakinumab) for the treatment of Still’s disease and multiple periodic fever syndromes, Kineret (anakinra) for the treatment of Neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID) and Arcalyst (rilonacept) for the treatment of CAPS. However, the therapeutic window of these drugs is limited by an increased risk of serious infections.

An NLRP3 inhibitor may be less immunosuppressive and better tolerated than an anti-IL-1β therapy because (a) other pathogen-recognizing inflammasomes can be engaged to produce IL-1β, and (b) risk of infection may be lower as the effects of a small molecule therapy are easily reversible upon discontinuation of therapy (hours to days) compared to an antibody, which clears the body very slowly (days to weeks).


In addition, preclinical data has linked NLRP3 activation to over 20 diseases resulting from aberrant inflammation. The most widely used NLRP3 inhibitor reference molecule, MCC950, which has been the starting point for a number of drug discovery programs, suggests efficacy in a wide range of murine disease models that are NLRP3-dependent. Moreover, NLRP3 has been shown to be over-expressed and activated in tissues from patients suffering from a wide range of inflammatory diseases. Finally, gain-of-function mutations in the NLRP3 gene are associated with orphan inflammatory diseases, including CAPS, providing a genetic rationale for NLRP3 inhibition.
 
Our Solution: VTX2735
 
VTX2735 is an oral, selective small molecule inhibitor of NLRP3 that is peripherally restricted and designed for the treatment of systemic inflammatory diseases, such as cardiovascular, dermatologic and rheumatic diseases.
 
VTX2735 inhibits NLRP3 with an IC50 of approximately 80 nM in human whole blood as assessed via lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-induced IL-1β production. The in vitro potency of VTX2735 is greater than first-generation NLRP3 inhibitors, such as MCC950 (Table 4). VTX2735 demonstrated in vitro activity and dose-dependent reductions of IL-1β release in cells from patients with CAPS, a rare inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by activating NLRP3 mutations.
 
Table 4: Comparison of in vitro potency of VTX2735 and MCC950 (Ventyx data)


IL-1ß IC50 | VTX2735 | MCC950 
Mouse Bone Marrow-Derived Macrophages | 6 nM | 18 nM 
Human Monocytes | 2 nM | 9 nM 
Human Whole Blood | 80 nM | 407 nM 
CAPS Patient Monocytes | 14-166 nM | >10,000 nM

Phase 1 Trial of VTX2735 in Healthy Volunteers
 
Overview
 
The Phase 1 SAD and MAD trial of VTX2735 was a two-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple ascending doses. The study enrolled 72 adult healthy volunteers across SAD cohorts up to 200 mg and MAD cohorts up to 200 mg daily for 14 days.
Safety and Tolerability
 
VTX2735 was well-tolerated across all dose cohorts and all subjects completed the trial. Drug exposures in both SAD and MAD cohorts increased linearly with dose. All drug-related AEs were considered mild, with no liver function test (LFT) abnormalities and no dose-related trend in the frequency of treatment-emergent AEs observed.
Pharmacodynamic Effects
 
Drug exposures also correlated with markers of target engagement as evidenced by strong PD activity in ex vivo LPS-plus ATP-mediated IL-1ß release assays from subject-derived plasma samples from both the SAD and MAD parts of the trial. VTX2735 demonstrated robust dose-related suppression of the induced pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1ß release relative to placebo. VTX2735 also demonstrated reduction from baseline in high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) concentrations.
Figure 17: Dose and Concentration-Dependent Suppression of IL-1ß Ex Vivo
 


Clinical Development Plan for VTX2735
 
Based on these positive Phase 1 results, we initiated a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial for VTX2735 in CAPS patients in the first quarter of 2023. We continue to evaluate additional indications for future clinical development of VTX2735.
 
Competition and Differentiation for VTX2735
 
Although there are no approved NLRP3 inhibitor therapies currently, several molecules are in development for treatment of inflammatory diseases. As of February 2023, these include DFV890 from Novartis (Phase 2 trials ongoing); RG6418 from Roche AG (Phase 1); NT-0796 (Phase 1) and NT-0249 (Phase 1) from NodThera; VENT-01, VENT-02 and VENT-05 (preclinical) from Ventus Therapeutics; and OLT-1177 (Phase 2 trials ongoing) from Olatec Therapeutics LLC.

VTX2735 may be differentiated from these other NLRP3 inhibitors due to its activity and selectivity in human whole blood assays, activity against certain mutations, robust pharmacodynamic activity in human cells, and dose-dependent activity in animal models.
 
Expanding our NLRP3 portfolio: CNS-Penetrant Inhibitor VTX3232
 
In addition to our peripheral NLRP3 inhibitor VTX2735 for systemic conditions, our portfolio of NLRP3 compounds includes CNS-penetrant inhibitors for potential therapeutic utility in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and MS, based on preclinical and clinical evidence underscoring the pathogenic role of NLRP3 in these neurodegenerative diseases.
 
We optimized the activity of our lead series of CNS-penetrant compounds for NLRP3 inhibition in the various assays. In addition to in vitro activity in cellular assays, we profiled the compounds for CNS penetration by pharmacokinetic data in the mouse and in the rat. The brain and plasma concentrations in these studies were measured at various time points when dosed orally to determine the optimal pharmacokinetic profile for a CNS-penetrant NLRP3 inhibitor. We plan to initiate a Phase 1 trial of VTX3232 in healthy volunteers in the first half of 2023.

Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our scientific knowledge, technology and development experience provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research

institutions. Any therapeutic candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing products and new products that may become available in the future.
 
Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize therapeutic products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products.
 
The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our therapeutic product candidates, if approved, are likely to be efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of competition, intellectual property protection and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 
We expect to face competition from existing products and products in development for each of our product candidates.
 
Our success will be based in part on our ability to identify, develop and commercialize a portfolio of product candidates that have a lower risk of side effects and/or provide more symptomatic improvement than competing products.
 
In addition to specific competitors described below, there may be other early stage or pre-clinical programs that, if approved, would compete with our product candidates. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances made in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these fields. Our success will be based in part on our ability to build and actively manage a portfolio of drugs that addresses unmet medical needs and creates value in patient therapy.
 
VTX958 (Psoriasis)
 
VTX958, currently in development for the treatment of several conditions, including moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, is an oral TYK2 inhibitor. If approved for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, VTX958 would compete with injected biologic therapies, such as Humira and Skyrizi, marketed by AbbVie Inc. and Eisai Co., Ltd., Stelara and Tremfya, marketed by Johnson & Johnson, Taltz, marketed by Eli Lilly and Company, Cosentyx, marketed by Novartis AG, Siliq, marketed by Bausch Health Companies, Inc., and Enbrel, marketed by Amgen Inc., Pfizer Inc. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited; non-injectable systemic therapies used to treat plaque psoriasis, such as Otezla, marketed by Amgen Inc. and Sotyktu (the first FDA-approved oral TYK2 inhibitor) marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company; topical therapies, such as Vtama (tapinarof), a topical AhR agonist marketed by Dermavant Sciences, Inc., branded and generic versions of clobetasol, such as Clobex, marketed by Galderma Laboratories, LP, generic versions of calcipotriene and the combination of betamethasone dipropionate/calcipotriene; and other treatments, including various lasers and ultraviolet light-based therapies.
 
We are aware of several companies with product candidates in development for the treatment of patients with psoriasis, including DC-806, which is an oral IL-17 antagonist developed by DICE Therapeutics; PN-235, which is an oral IL-23R antagonist being developed by Protagonist Therapeutics; BMS-986322, which is an oral TYK2 inhibitor being developed by BMS; ESK-001, which is an oral TYK2 inhibitor being developed by Alumis, Inc.; and TAK-279, which is an oral TYK2 inhibitor being developed by Takeda.

In addition, we are developing VTX958 in psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease and potentially other indications where we also expect competition from approved medicines for these indications that are currently marketed and other product candidates in development.


VTX002 (Ulcerative Colitis)
 
VTX002, currently in development for the treatment of moderate-to-severe UC, is an oral S1P1R modulator. If approved for the treatment of patients with moderately to severely active UC, VTX002 would compete with: Zeposia (ozanimod), which is an S1P1R modulator marketed by BMS; Entyvio (vedolizumab), which is an a4ß7 integrin antibody marketed by Takeda; Humira (adalimumab), which is a TNF antibody marketed by AbbVie Inc.; Stelara (ustekinumab), which is an IL-12/IL-23 antibody marketed by Johnson & Johnson; Xeljanz (tofacitinib), which is a JAK1 inhibitor marketed by Pfizer Inc.; Rinvoq (upadacitinib), which is a JAK1 inhibitor marketed by AbbVie; Jyseleca (filgotinib), which is a JAK1 inhibitor marketed in the European Union, Great Britain and Japan by Galapagos NV; and Simponi (golimumab), which is a TNF antibody marketed by Johnson & Johnson.
 
We are aware of several companies with product candidates in development for the treatment of patients with UC, including: etrasimod, which is an S1PR modulator that has completed Phase 3 trials and is being developed by Pfizer Inc.; Roivant’s RVT-301, a Phase 2 anti-TL1A antibody; Prometheus Biosciences’ PRA023, a Phase 2 anti-TL1A antibody; and risankizumab, guselkumab and mirikizumab, which are anti-IL-23 antibodies being developed in Phase 3 clinical trials by AbbVie, Inc., Janssen Pharmaceuticals N.V. and Eli Lilly and Company, respectively. We are also aware of additional product candidates in clinical development by AbbVie Inc., Abivax SA, Amgen Inc., Bausch Health Companies, Inc. (Salix Pharmaceuticals), BMS, Connect Biopharma Holdings Limited, Gilead Sciences, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Janssen Pharmaceuticals N.V., Landos Biopharma, Inc., Merck & Co., Inc., Morphic Therapeutic, Inc., Pfizer Inc., Protagonist Therapeutics, Inc., Theravance Biopharma, Inc., Pandion Therapeutics, Inc., RedHill Biopharma Ltd. and Seres Therapeutics, Inc.
 
VTX2735 and VTX3232 (NLRP3 Inhibitor Portfolio)
 
VTX2735 is our lead peripherally restricted NLRP3 inhibitor, a class of medicines with no currently approved agents. We are also developing VTX3232 as our lead CNS-penetrant NLRP3 inhibitor candidate. We are aware of several other NLRP3 inhibitors in clinical development, including DFV890 from Novartis (Phase 2 trials ongoing); RG6418 from Roche AG (Phase 1); NT-0796 (Phase 1) and NT-0249 (Phase 1) from NodThera; VENT-01, VENT-02 and VENT-05 (preclinical) from Ventus Therapeutics; and OLT-1177 (Phase 2 trials ongoing) from Olatec Therapeutics LLC.
Manufacturing
 
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We rely on third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing. We intend to rely on third-party contract manufacturers for commercial manufacturing if our product candidates receive marketing approval. We believe there are multiple sources for all of the materials required for the manufacture of our product candidates. Our manufacturing strategy enables us to more efficiently direct financial resources to the research, development and commercialization of product candidates rather than diverting resources to develop manufacturing facilities internally. As our product candidates advance through development, we expect to enter into longer-term commercial supply agreements with key suppliers and manufacturers to fulfill and secure our production needs.
Intellectual Property
 
We strive to protect the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing patent applications in the U.S. and in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. directed to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology and product candidates and continuing innovation to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position. We also plan to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions when available. Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including any patents that we may own in the future; and to operate without infringing on the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.
 

VTX958
 
As of March 16, 2023, with respect to our TYK2 program, we own three pending U.S. patent applications, two pending U.S. provisional patent applications, and more than fifty pending foreign patent applications. More specifically, we own one pending U.S. patent application, and more than twenty pending foreign patent applications with claims directed to our lead product candidate, VTX958, and other related compounds as a composition of matter, as well as claims directed to pharmaceutical compositions and uses of such compounds, including the use of VTX958, to treat inflammatory or autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis. Any patents that may issue from these pending applications directed to VTX958 are expected to expire in November 2040, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. In addition, we own two pending U.S. provisional applications with claims directed to processes of making and crystalline forms (polymorphs) of VTX958. Any patents that may issue from these additional pending applications directed to VTX958 are expected to expire between 2043 and 2044, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
VTX002
 
As of March 16, 2023, with respect to our S1P1R program, we own one U.S. patent, one pending U.S. patent application, more than forty foreign patents (including in various European countries, Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Macao, Mexico, and Russia), and eight pending foreign patent applications (in Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, and the Philippines) with claims directed to our lead product candidate, VTX002, and other related compounds as a composition of matter, as well as claims directed to pharmaceutical compositions and uses of such compounds, including the use of VTX002, to treat UC. The issued patents, and any patents that may issue from these pending applications directed to VTX002, are expected to expire in November 2036 absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. In addition, we own two pending U.S. provisional applications with claims directed to processes of making and crystalline forms (polymorphs) of VTX002. Any patents that may issue from these additional pending applications directed to VTX002 are expected to expire between 2043 and 2044, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
VTX2735 and VTX3232
 
As of March 16, 2023, with respect to our NLRP3 program, we own one U.S. patent, four pending U.S. patent applications, one pending U.S. provisional patent application, more than fifty pending foreign patent applications, and two international patent applications filed under the PCT. More specifically, we own one U.S. patent, one pending U.S. patent application, and more than twenty pending foreign patent applications with claims directed to our lead product candidate, VTX2735, and other related compounds as a composition of matter, as well as claims directed to pharmaceutical compositions and uses of such compounds, including VTX2735. Any patents that may issue from these pending applications are expected to expire in March 2041, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. Further, we own one pending U.S. patent application, one pending U.S. provisional patent application, two pending foreign patent applications (in Taiwan and Argentina), and one international patent application filed under the PCT with claims directed to our lead product candidate, VTX3232, and other related compounds as a composition of matter, as well as claims directed to pharmaceutical compositions and uses of such compounds, including VTX3232. Any patents that may issue from these pending applications directed to VTX3232 are expected to expire in March 2043, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
We also possess know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of our product candidates.
 
With respect to our product candidates and processes we intend to develop and commercialize in the normal course of business, we intend to pursue patent protection covering, when possible, compositions, methods of use, dosing and formulations. We may also pursue patent protection with respect to manufacturing and drug development processes and technologies.
 
Issued patents can provide protection for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In general, patents issued for applications filed in the U.S. can provide exclusionary rights for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In addition, in certain instances, the term of an issued U.S. patent that covers or claims an FDA approved product can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, which is called patent term extension. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The term of patents outside of the U.S. varies in accordance with the laws of the foreign jurisdiction, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from

country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
 
The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of immunology has emerged in the U.S. The relevant patent laws and their interpretation outside of the U.S. is also uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the U.S. and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our technology or product candidates and could affect the value of such intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions and improvements. We cannot guarantee that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products, the methods of use or manufacture of those products. Moreover, even our issued patents do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products. Patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology space are evolving and involve many risks and uncertainties. For example, third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology, and our issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or could limit the term of patent protection that otherwise may exist for our product candidates. In addition, the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies that are outside the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents. For these reasons, we may face competition with respect to our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any patent protection for such product may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides.
 
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application, or NDA, process before it may be legally marketed in the U.S.
U.S. Drug Development Process
 
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs, including small molecules, under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
 ▪completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and other applicable regulations;
 ▪submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 ▪approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
 ▪performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
 ▪submission to the FDA of an NDA;


▪a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept the filing for review;
 ▪satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
 ▪satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current GMP, or cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
 ▪satisfactory completion of other studies required by the FDA, including immunogenicity, carcinogenicity, genotoxicity and stability studies;
 ▪FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the U.S.; and
 ▪compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
 
Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An investigational new drug, or IND, sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The sponsor will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the first phase of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns about on-going or proposed clinical trials or non-compliance with specific FDA requirements, and the trials may not begin or continue until the FDA notifies the sponsor that the hold has been lifted. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
 
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. They must be conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND as well as any subsequent protocol amendments, and timely safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events. An IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 ▪Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human volunteers and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. Sponsors sometimes designate their Phase 1 clinical trials as Phase 1a or Phase 1b. Phase 1b clinical trials are typically aimed at confirming dosing, pharmacokinetics and safety in larger number of patients. Some Phase 1b studies evaluate biomarkers or surrogate markers that may be associated with efficacy in patients with specific types of diseases.
 ▪Phase 2: This phase involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage.
 ▪Phase 3: Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling.



Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
 
The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. In addition, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial.
 
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
While the IND is active and before approval, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
 
There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed trial results to public registries. Sponsors of certain clinical trials of FDA-regulated products are required to register and disclose specified clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved.
 
As a result of the COVID-19 public health emergency, we may be required to develop and implement additional clinical trial policies and procedures designed to help protect subjects from the COVID-19 virus. For example, in March 2020, the FDA issued a guidance, which the FDA subsequently updated, on conducting clinical trials during the pandemic. In June 2020, FDA also issued a guidance on good manufacturing practice considerations for responding to COVID-19 infection in employees in drug products manufacturing, including recommendations for manufacturing controls to prevent contamination of drugs. Additional COVID-19 related guidance released by FDA include guidance updates and additional guidance documents that address resuming normal drug and biologics manufacturing operations; manufacturing, supply chain, and inspections; and statistical considerations for clinical trials during the COVID-19 public health emergency, among others. In view of the spread of the COVID-19 variants, FDA may issue additional guidance and policies that may materially impact our business and clinical development timelines. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations and clinical development plans is highly uncertain and subject to change and will depend on future developments, including new regulatory requirements and changes to existing regulations. If new guidance and policies are promulgated by the FDA that require changes in our clinical protocol or clinical development plans, our anticipated timelines and regulatory approval may be delayed or materially impacted.
 

NDA Review and Approval Process
 
The results of product development, preclinical and other non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after the application is submitted. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
 
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
 
After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional pivotal Phase 3 trial or other significant and time consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA or, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
 
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approval including the requirement for REMS to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Marketing approval may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing.
 
The Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a

non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
 
Expedited Development and Review Programs
 
A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate FDA’s review and approval of new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. The FDA has a fast track designation program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Unique to a fast track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
 
Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a fast track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs under its current PDUFA review goals. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 
In addition, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. On December 29, 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, including the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act (FDORA), was signed into law. FDORA made several changes to the FDA’s authorities and its regulatory framework, including, among other changes, reforms to the accelerated approval pathway, such as requiring the FDA to specify conditions for post-approval study requirements and setting forth procedures for the FDA to withdraw a product on an expedited basis for non-compliance with post-approval requirements.
 
A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If the FDA designates a breakthrough therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the therapy; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and considering alternative clinical trial designs when scientifically appropriate, which may result in smaller trials or more efficient trials that require less time to complete and may minimize the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, which means that the sponsor may file sections of the NDA for review on a rolling basis if certain conditions are satisfied, including an agreement with FDA on the proposed schedule for submission of portions of the application and the payment of applicable user fees before the FDA may initiate a review. The breakthrough therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be

granted to the same drug if relevant criteria are met. If a product is designated as breakthrough therapy, the FDA will work to expedite the development and review of such drug.
 
Fast track designation, priority review and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate. Depending on other factors that impact clinical trial timelines and development, such as our ability to identify and onboard clinical sites and rates of study participant enrollment and drop-out, we may not realize all the benefits of these expedited or accelerated review programs.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, certain manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP regulations and other laws and regulations. In addition, the FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 
Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us or our partners pursuant to FDA approvals will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the drug, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, drug sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market and imposes requirements and restrictions on drug manufacturers, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet.
 
Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical holds on post-approval clinical trials, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties.
 
NDA Marketing Exclusivity
 
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder.
 

The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the U.S. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances.
 
In Catalyst Pharms., Inc. v. Becerra, 14 F.4th 1299 (11th Cir. 2021), the court disagreed with the FDA’s longstanding position that the orphan drug exclusivity only applies to the approved use or indication within an eligible disease. This decision created uncertainty in the application of the orphan drug exclusivity. On January 24, 2023, the FDA published a notice in the Federal Register to clarify that while the agency complies with the court’s order in Catalyst, FDA intends to continue to apply its longstanding interpretation of the regulations to matters outside of the scope of the Catalyst order – that is, the agency will continue tying the scope of orphan-drug exclusivity to the uses or indications for which a drug is approved, which permits other sponsors to obtain approval of a drug for new uses or indications within the same orphan designated disease or condition that have not yet been approved. It is unclear how future litigation, legislation, agency decisions, and administrative actions will impact the scope of the orphan drug exclusivity.
 
U.S. Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate for which we may seek regulatory approval. Sales in the U.S. will depend, in part, on the availability of sufficient coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, which include government health programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Veterans Administration, as well as managed care organizations and private health insurers. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our product candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by third-party payors.
 
The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. A third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be available. Additionally, in the U.S. there is no uniform policy among payors for coverage or reimbursement. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval processes. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available, or are available only at limited levels, successful commercialization of, and obtaining a satisfactory financial return on, any product we develop may not be possible.
 
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for marketing, we may need to conduct expensive studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, which would be in addition to the costs expended to obtain regulatory approvals. Third-party payors may not consider our product candidates to be medically necessary or cost-effective compared to other available therapies, or the rebate percentages required to secure favorable coverage may not yield an adequate margin over cost or may not enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development.
 
U.S. Healthcare Reform
 
In the U.S., there has been, and continues to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect the profitable sale of product candidates.
 

Among policy makers and payors in the U.S., there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the U.S., the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things: (1) increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; (2) created a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for certain drugs and biologics that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; (3) established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs; (4) expanded the availability of lower pricing under the 340B drug pricing program by adding new entities to the program; (5) expanded the eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; (6) created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; (7) created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (and 70% commencing January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; (8) established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and (9) established a Center for Medicare Innovation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drugs.
 
Since its enactment, there have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, in June 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court held that Texas and other challengers had no legal standing to challenge the ACA, dismissing the case on procedural grounds without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and healthcare measures promulgated by the Biden administration will impact the ACA, our business, financial condition and results of operations. Complying with any new legislation or reversing changes implemented under the ACA could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law, which, among other things, resulted in aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2032, with the exception of a temporary suspension implemented under various COVID-19 relief legislation from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 
Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, effective January 1, 2024, the statutory cap on Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rebates that manufacturers pay to state Medicaid programs will be eliminated. Elimination of this cap may require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay more in rebates than it receives on the sale of products, which could have a material impact on our business. In August 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes prescription drug provisions that have significant implications for the pharmaceutical industry and Medicare beneficiaries, including allowing the federal government to negotiate a maximum fair price for certain high-priced single source Medicare drugs, imposing penalties and excise tax for manufacturers that fail to comply with the drug price negotiation requirements, requiring inflation rebates for all Medicare Part B and Part D drugs, with limited exceptions, if their drug prices increase faster than inflation, and redesigning Medicare Part D to reduce out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for beneficiaries, among other changes. In an effort to curb Medicare Patients’ out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs, the Part D redesign legislation requires manufacturers to contribute to the catastrophic coverage phase for Part D drugs, as discounts through a manufacturer discount program. Furthermore, any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The impact of these legislative, executive, and administrative actions and any future healthcare measures and agency rules implemented by the Biden administration on us and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole is unclear. The impact of these legislative, executive, and administrative actions and any future

healthcare measures and agency rules implemented by the Biden administration on us and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole is unclear. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a reduction in payments from private payors. The impact of legislative, executive and administrative actions of the Biden administration on us and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole is unclear.
 
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. We are unable to predict the future course of federal or state healthcare legislation in the U.S. directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action will be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. If we or any third parties we may engage are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we or such third parties are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, our products candidates may lose regulatory approval that may have been obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.
 
U.S. Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
Federal and state healthcare laws and regulations restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations, data privacy and security and transparency laws and regulations.
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act and the Civil Monetary Penalties Statute.
 
The federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any individual or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government.
 
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal civil and criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program. In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of protected health information on HIPAA covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates who conduct certain activities for or on their behalf involving protected health information on their behalf as well as their covered subcontractors.
 
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable group purchasing organizations and applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to certain payments and other transfers of value made to covered recipients, including physicians licensed to practice in the U.S. (defined to include doctors of medicine and osteopathy, dentists, podiatrists, optometrists and licensed chiropractors), certain non-physician healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners, among others) and teaching hospitals, in the previous year, as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by covered physicians and their immediate family members.

Similar state and local laws and regulations may also restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by patients themselves; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments or transfers of value that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral

sources; state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information or which require tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to physicians, other healthcare providers and entities; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and local laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
Efforts to ensure compliance with applicable healthcare laws and regulations can involve substantial costs. Violations of healthcare laws can result in significant penalties, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other U.S. healthcare programs, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of operations.
 
Foreign Regulation
 
In order to market any product outside of the U.S., we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the U.S. apply similarly in the context of the European Union, or EU, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries or jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 
To market a medicinal product in the European Economic Area, or EEA (which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), we must obtain a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations:
 ▪the Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment certain diseases, such as AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU; and
 ▪National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure.
 
Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
 
Data and Marketing Exclusivity
 
In the EEA, new products authorized for marketing, or reference products, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its

product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The 10-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
 
Pediatric Investigation Plan
 
In the EEA, marketing authorization applications for new medicinal products not authorized have to include the results of studies conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once the marketing authorization is obtained in all Member States of the EU and study results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate extension.
Clinical Trials
 
Clinical trials of medicinal products in the European Union must be conducted in accordance with European Union and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization, or ICH, guidelines on GCPs. Additional GCP guidelines from the European Commission, focusing in particular on traceability, apply to clinical trials of advanced therapy medicinal products. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the European Union, it must appoint an entity within the European Union to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU countries, the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial.
 
Prior to commencing a clinical trial, the sponsor must obtain a clinical trial authorization from the competent authority, and a positive opinion from an independent ethics committee. The application for a clinical trial authorization must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. Clinical trials in the European Union were regulated under European Council Directive 2001/20/EC (Clinical Trials Directive) on the implementation of GCP in the conduct of clinical trials of medicinal products for human use. In April 2014, Regulation EU No 536/2014 (Clinical Trials Regulation) was adopted to replace the Clinical Trials Directive. The Clinical Trials Regulation entered into application on January 31, 2022, and is intended to simplify the rules for clinical trial authorization and standards of performance. For instance, there is a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point, a European Union portal and database. The new clinical trial portal and database is maintained by the EMA in collaboration with the European Commission and the European Union Member States. The objectives of the new Regulation include consistent rules for conducting trials throughout the European Union, consistent data standards and adverse events listing, and consistent information on the authorization status. Additionally, information on the conduct and results of each clinical trial carried out in the European Union will be made publicly available. A clinical trial may only be commenced after an Ethics Committee has given its approval. Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the clinical trial applications must be notified to or approved by the relevant competent authorities and ethics committees. Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP. Other national and European Union-wide regulatory requirements also apply.
 
Privacy and Data Protection Laws
 
We are subject to laws and regulations in non-U.S. countries covering data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. EU member states and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations that impose significant compliance obligations. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure, processing and security of personal information that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, such as names, contact information, and sensitive personal data such as health data. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent revisions and differing interpretations, and have generally become more stringent over time.
 
In the European Union, or EU, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, imposes many requirements for controllers and processors of personal data, including, for example, high standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal

data, robust disclosures to individuals and a robust individual data rights regime, abbreviated timelines for data breach notifications, limitations on retention and secondary use of information, requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data and obligations when we contract third-party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data. The GDPR allows EU member states to make additional laws and regulations further limiting the Processing of genetic, biometric or health data. Failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR and the applicable national data protection laws of the EU member states could subject us to regulatory sanctions, delays in clinical trials, criminal prosecution and/or civil fines or penalties. Changes to the GDPR and applicable national laws related to privacy, data protection, and data security, including with respect to how these laws should be applied in the context of clinical trials or other transactions from which we may gain access to personal data, could increase our compliance costs and exposure to potential liability.
 
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 58 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee, 22 of whom have a Ph.D. or M.D. and 21 of whom were engaged in research and development activities. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 
Our human capital resource objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards.
