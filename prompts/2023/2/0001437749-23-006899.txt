Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“CPP”) Acquisition
 

On June 15, 2022, Panbela acquired CPP, a private clinical stage company developing therapeutics to reduce the risk and recurrence of cancer and rare diseases, via merger for consideration consisting of (a) 164,689 shares of common stock, (b) 18,298 shares of common stock that remained subject to a holdback escrow (as defined in the Merger Agreement), (c) replacement options to purchase up to 39,918 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $14.00 per share, and (d) replacement warrants to purchase up to 8,451 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $165.80 per share, and post-closing contingent payments up to a maximum of $60 million, subject to satisfaction of milestones.
Holding Company Reorganization
 
Effective June 15, 2022, Panbela became a successor issuer to Panbela Research, Inc. (formerly known as Panbela Therapeutics, Inc., the “Predecessor”) pursuant to a holding company reorganization in which the Predecessor became a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Panbela. Panbela became a successor issuer to the Predecessor by operation of Rule 12g-3(a) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the (“Exchange Act”).
Business Overview
 
Panbela is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing disruptive therapeutics for the treatment of patients with urgent unmet medical needs. We are currently enrolling patients in our randomized double blind placebo controlled clinical trial for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, and we are in a regulatory and commercial collaboration with our North American partner, One-Two Therapeutics Assets Limited (“One-Two”), on a Phase III clinical trial funded by the National Cancer Institute (the “NCI”) for the study of colon cancer risk reduction and colon adenoma therapy (“CAT”), a preventative treatment approach for survivors of colorectal cancer or those who have high-risk colon polyps. In addition, we are working closely with One-Two designing a Phase III registration trial for familial adenomatous polyposis (“FAP”), a rare inherited condition that can cause the growth of thousands of colorectal adenomas (i.e., adenomatous polyps), which are recognized as a key risk factor for colon cancer. We also support several investigator initiated trials and company sponsored preclinical trials including: (1) Phase I and Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of neuroblastoma (“neuroblastoma” or “NB”), funded by nonprofit organizations; (2) Phase I and Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of early-onset type 1 diabetes funded by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation; (3) Phase II clinical trial for the treatment of gastric cancer funded by the NCI; (4) Phase I/II clinical trial for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) possessing the STK11 mutation; and (5) preclinical studies that we have sponsored in the orphan disease and cancer fields.
 
The Company’s lead assets are ivospemin (SBP-101), FlynpoviTM (eflornithine (CPP-1X) and sulindac), and eflornithine (CPP-1X), which provide a multi-targeted approach to reset dysregulated biology present in many types of diseases such as cancer and autoimmunity. Many tumors require greatly elevated levels of polyamines to support their growth and survival. These agents target the polyamine pathway at complementary junctions, which have been shown to be altered in disease. In particular, our lead assets have the potential to suppress and prevent tumor growth, enhance anti-tumor activity of other anti-cancer agents, and modulate the immune system.

Ivospemin is a proprietary polyamine analogue designed to induce polyamine metabolic inhibition. Ivospemin has demonstrated encouraging activity against metastatic disease in a clinical trial of patients with pancreatic cancer. The efficacy and safety results demonstrated in our completed Phase I clinical trial of ivospemin in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in the first line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer provide support for the current randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of ivospemin in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in patients previously untreated for metastatic pancreatic cancer. We believe that ivospemin, if successfully developed, may represent a novel approach that effectively treats patients with pancreatic cancer and could become a dominant product in that market. Only three first-line treatment combinations, a single maintenance treatment for a subset (3-7%) of patients, and one second-line drug have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) for pancreatic cancer in the last 25 years. Ivospemin has received Fast Track status and orphan drug designation status for pancreatic cancer in the United States and we have also received orphan drug designation in Europe.
 
Our June 2022 acquisition of CPP added the Company’s second lead asset, eflornithine, in multiple forms. First, an investigational new drug product, Flynpovi is a combination of the polyamine synthesis inhibitor eflornithine and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug sulindac and then secondly, eflornithine as a single agent. Eflornithine is an enzyme-activated, irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the first rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of polyamines. Sulindac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), facilitates the export and catabolism of polyamines. Flynpovi has a unique dual mechanism of action whereby it suppresses the synthesis of new polyamines and increases the export and catabolism of polyamines from the diet and microbiome. We believe Flynpovi is unique in that it is designed to treat the risk factors (e.g., polyps) that are hypothesized to lead to Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) surgeries and colon cancer and therefore may have the ability to prevent various types of colon cancer. In the FAP-310 Phase III trial, the efficacy and safety of Flynpovi (eflornithine (CPP-1X) and sulindac), as compared with either drug alone, in adults with FAP was conducted. While the study missed the primary composite endpoint (Burke et al. 2020), a post-hoc analysis showed that none of the patients in the combination arm progressed to a need for lower gastrointestinal (LGI) surgery for up to 48 months compared to 13.2% and 15.7% of patients in the sulindac and eflornithine arms (Balaguer et al. 2022). These data corresponded to risk reductions for the need for LGI surgery approaching 100% between combination and either monotherapy. Given the statistical significance of the LGI group, a new drug application (NDA) was filed with the FDA; however, since this was based on the results of an exploratory analysis, a complete response letter (CRL) was issued. To address the CRL, the Company, together with an existing North American license partner, is designing a Phase III registration trial, which is scheduled to begin in the second-half of 2023. There are no currently approved pharmaceutical therapies for FAP.
 
Additional programs are evaluating a single agent tablet eflornithine or high dose powder eflornithine sachets for several indications including prevention of gastric cancer, treatment of high-risk refractory neuroblastoma, recent onset Type 1 diabetes, and STK-11 mutant NSCLC. Preclinical studies as well as Phase I or Phase II investigator-initiated trials suggest that eflornithine treatment is well tolerated and has potential activity.
 
Flynpovi has received Fast Track designation in the United States and orphan drug designation status for FAP in the United States and Europe. In addition, we have received orphan drug designation status for eflornithine as a single agent for neuroblastoma in the United States and Europe and for gastric cancer in the United States.
 
Clinical Trials
 
Ivospemin (SBP-101)
 
In August 2015, the FDA accepted our Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application for our ivospemin (SBP-101) product candidate. We have completed an initial clinical trial of ivospemin in patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. This was a Phase I, first-in-human, dose-escalation, safety study. From January 2016 through September 2017, we enrolled twenty-nine patients into six cohorts, or groups, in the dose-escalation phase of the Phase I trial. No drug-related bone marrow toxicity or peripheral neuropathy was observed at any dose level. In addition to being evaluated for safety, 23 of the 29 patients were evaluable for preliminary signals of efficacy prior to or at the eight-week conclusion of their first cycle of treatment using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (“RECIST”), the currently accepted standard for evaluating change in the size of tumors. A summary of both the safety and preliminary signals of efficacy for this completed clinical trial is contained later in this report under ivospemin (SBP-101) Clinical Development – Pancreatic Cancer, Phase I Clinical Trial Design and Completion (ivospemin Monotherapy).

In 2018, we began enrolling patients in our second clinical trial, a Phase Ia/Ib study of the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of ivospemin administered in combination with two standard-of-care chemotherapy agents, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. A total of 25 subjects were enrolled in 4 cohorts to evaluate the dosage level and schedule. An additional 25 subjects were enrolled in the expansion phase of the trial. Interim results were presented in January of 2022. Best response in evaluable subjects (cohorts 4 and Ib N=29) was a Complete Response (CR) in 1 (3%), Partial Response (PR) in 13 (45%), Stable Disease (SD) in 10 (34%) and Progressive Disease (PD) in 5 (17%). One subject did not have post baseline scans with RECIST tumor assessments. Median Progression Free Survival (“PFS”), now final at 6.5 months, may have been negatively impacted by drug dosing interruptions to evaluate potential toxicity. Median overall survival in Cohort 4 + Phase Ib was 12.0 months when data was presented in January 2022 and is now final at 14.6 months. Two patients from cohort 2 have demonstrated long term survival: one at 30.3 months (final data) and one at 33.0 months and still alive as of March 18, 2022. Seven subjects were still alive at the data cutoff date of March 18, 2022, one from cohort 2 and six from cohort 4 plus Ib. Further details regarding the study design, safety and interim signals of efficacy are contained later in this report under ivospemin (SBP-101) Clinical Development – Pancreatic Cancer, Phase Ia/Ib Clinical Trial Interim Results (First Line Combination Therapy).
 
The safety results and tumor growth inhibition demonstrated in our Phase Ia/b study provides support for the randomized study of SBP-101 initiated in January of 2022. The trial, referred to as the ASPIRE trial, is a randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in patients previously untreated for metastatic pancreatic cancer. The trial is being conducted globally at approximately 95 sites in the United States, Europe and Asia-Pacific. The ASPIRE trial commenced in 2022 and, while opening of clinical sites in the U.S. and the rest of the world has been slower than originally anticipated, due in part to resource fatigue in the medical community, the Company expects all countries and sites to be open by mid-2023.
 
The trial was originally designed as a Phase II/III with a smaller sample size (150) to support the events required for interim analysis based on Progression Free Survival (PFS) and a primary endpoint of overall survival. In response to European and FDA regulatory feedback, the study was amended to include the total trial sample size (600) and the design modified to utilize overall survival as the primary endpoint to be examined at interim analysis. PFS will also be analyzed to provide additional efficacy evidence. This amendment was supported by the final data from the Phase Ia/Ib first line metastatic pancreatic cancer trial which completed enrollment in December of 2020. The study will enroll 600 subjects and is anticipated to take 36 months for complete enrollment with the interim analysis available in early 2024. Further details regarding the study design and anticipated timing are contained later in this report under ivospemin (SBP-101) Clinical Development – Pancreatic Cancer, Randomized Clinical Trial design and anticipated timing (ASPIRE trial).
 
If we can successfully complete all FDA recommended clinical studies, we intend to seek marketing authorization from the FDA, the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) (European Union), and TGA (Australia). The submission fees may be waived when ivospemin has been designated an orphan drug in each geographic region.
 
In early April 2022, the Company announced a poster presentation highlighting the results for ivospemin as a polyamine metabolism modulator in ovarian cancer at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Conference which was subsequently published in June 2022 in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences (Holbert et al. 2022). The poster and publication conclude that the ivospemin treatment of C57Bl/6 mice injected with VDID8+ ovarian cancer cells significantly prolonged survival and decreased overall tumor burden. The results suggest that ivospemin may have a role in the clinical management of ovarian cancer, and the Company intends to continue pre-clinical and clinical studies in ovarian cancer.

Flynpovi
 
December 2009, the FDA accepted our IND application for the combination product, Flynpovi. Flynpovi showed promising results in an NCI supported randomized, placebo-controlled Phase IIb/III clinical trial to prevent recurrent colon adenomas, particularly high-risk pre-cancerous polyps in which 375 subjects who had resected sporadic adenoma were treated for 3 years with eflornithine (500 mg once a day) + sulindac (150 mg once a day [N = 191]) or matched placebo/placebo (N = 184). Results demonstrated a marked risk reduction (70%) in developing metachronous adenomas, 92% risk reduction in developing advanced adenomas, and 95% risk reduction in developing multiple adenomas with the active combination regimen compared to placebo (Meyskens et al. 2008). This combination regimen was generally well tolerated.
 
Given the similar mechanism of disease in sporadic and FAP-associated adenomatous polyposis, and the mechanism of action of Flynpovi in prevention of progressive polyposis in both the general population with sporadic adenomas and in patients with FAP, a Phase III program in FAP and a Phase III program to study colon cancer risk reduction in partnership with the Southwest Oncology Group (“SWOG”) and the NCI were initiated.
 

In the FAP-310 Phase III study completed in 2019, the efficacy and safety of the combination of eflornithine and sulindac, as compared with either drug alone, in adults with familial adenomatous polyposis was conducted (Burke et al. 2020). The patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive eflornithine, sulindac, or both once daily for up to 48 months. The primary end point, assessed in a time-to-event analysis, was disease progression, defined as a composite of major surgery, endoscopic excision of advanced adenomas, diagnosis of high-grade dysplasia in the rectum or pouch, or progression of duodenal disease. A total of 171 patients underwent randomization. Disease progression occurred in 18 of 56 patients (32%) in the eflornithine-sulindac group, 22 of 58 (38%) in the sulindac group, and 23 of 57 (40%) in the eflornithine group, with a hazard ratio of 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39 to 1.32) for eflornithine-sulindac as compared with sulindac (P = 0.29) and 0.66 (95% CI, 0.36 to 1.23) for eflornithine-sulindac as compared with eflornithine (Burke et al. 2020). Adverse and serious adverse events were similar across the treatment groups. In a post-hoc analysis, none of the patients in the combination arm progressed to a need for lower gastrointestinal (LGI) surgery for up to 48 months compared with 7 (13.2%) and 8 (15.7%) patients in the sulindac and eflornithine arms (Balaguer et al. 2022). These data corresponded to risk reductions for the need for LGI surgery approaching 100% between combination and either monotherapy with HR = 0.00 (95% CI, 0.00-0.48; p = 0.005) for combination versus sulindac and HR = 0.00 (95% CI, 0.00-0.44; p = 0.003) for combination versus eflornithine. Given the statistical significance of the LGI group, an NDA was filed with the FDA. As the study failed to meet the primary endpoint, and the NDA was based on the results of an exploratory analysis, a complete response letter was issued. To address this deficiency concern, the Company must submit the results of one or more adequate and well-controlled clinical trials which demonstrate an effect on a clinical endpoint.
 
In collaboration with the NCI, and SWOG, a Phase III clinical trial has been initiated to study the benefits of Flynpovi as a therapeutic treatment for use by colon cancer survivors. The trial is named PACES for “Prevention of Adenomas and Cancer with eflornithine and sulindac.” The PACES trial is funded by the NCI and managed by SWOG. This is an ongoing Phase III double blind placebo-controlled trial of Flynpovi to prevent recurrence of high risk adenomas and second primary colorectal cancers in patients with stage 0-III colon or rectal cancer.  The purpose of this study is to assess whether Flynpovi (compared to corresponding placebos) has a reduced rate of cancer or high-risk adenoma recurrence compared to comparator arms after three years of daily dosing. We have exclusive rights to the data that comes from the trial for regulatory and commercial purposes. The Company is evaluating its options for colorectal adenoma therapy (CAT) in the European Union and Asia.
 
On July 16, 2021, CPP entered into a license agreement with One-Two. Under the license agreement, One-Two has licensed the North American development and commercialization rights for Flynpovi. As the result of this license agreement, the FAP registration trial is fully funded and is scheduled to begin in the second-half of 2023.
 
Eflornithine (CPP-1X) and eflornithine sachets (CPP-1X-S)
 
For the single agent eflornithine, there is a trial ongoing evaluating eflornithine sachets (CPP-1X-S) in relapsed refractory neuroblastoma supported by the Children’s’ Oncology Group (COG) and the NCI. Additionally, a Phase I/II trial in STK11 mutation patients with non-small cell lung cancer and Phase II trial in Recent Onset Type I diabetes with eflornithine are scheduled to begin this year. Lastly, a Phase II trial evaluating eflornithine for the prevention of gastric cancer was completed in 2021 with data analysis ongoing.

Pancreatic Cancer
 
Pancreatic cancer afflicts approximately 140,000 people in Europe (GLOBOCAN 2020, Global Cancer Observatory/World Health Organization), approximately 60,000 people in the United States annually (https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/pancreas.html), and 293,000 people worldwide – excluding Europe and United States (GLOBOCAN 2020). It has been identified as the fourth leading cause of death from cancer in Europe (GLOBOCAN 2020) and the third leading cause of death from cancer in the United States (SEER Cancer Statistics Factsheets 2021). On average, Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (“PDA”) represents approximately 95% of all pancreatic cancers diagnosed in a given calendar year. Considering that the median overall survival for previously untreated patients with good performance status is between 8.5 months (Von Hoff 2013) and 11.1 months (Conroy 2011) with the two most commonly available treatment regimens, effective treatment for PDA has remained a major unmet medical need.

Pancreatic cancer is generally not diagnosed early because the initial clinical signs and symptoms are vague and non-specific. The most common presenting symptoms include weight loss, epigastric (upper central region of the abdomen) and/or back pain, and jaundice. The back pain is typically dull, constant, and of visceral origin radiating to the back, in contrast to the epigastric pain which is vague and intermittent. Less common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, and new onset diabetes (which can be an early signal) or glucose intolerance (Hidalgo 2010).
 
Surgery remains the only treatment option with curative intent, although only about 20% of patients are candidates for surgical resection at the time of the diagnosis. Patients who undergo radical surgery still have a limited survival rate, averaging 23 months (Macarulla T, et al Clin Transl Oncol 2017).
 
For the minority of patients who present with resectable disease, surgery is the treatment of choice. Depending on the location of the tumor, the operative procedures may involve cephalic pancreatoduodenectomy, referred to as a “Whipple procedure” distal pancreatectomy or total pancreatectomy. Pancreatic enzyme deficiency and diabetes are frequent complications of both the disease and these surgical procedures. Up to 70% of patients with pancreatic cancer present with biliary obstruction that can be relieved by percutaneous or endoscopic stent placement. However, even if the tumor is fully resected, the outcome in patients with pancreatic cancer has been disappointing (Hidalgo 2010, Seufferlein 2012). Post-operative administration of chemotherapy improved progression-free and overall survival in three large randomized clinical trials (Hidalgo 2010), but median post-surgical survival in patients treated in all three trials was similar, only 20-22 months. Pre-operative (neo-adjuvant) chemotherapy is of increasing interest, with the goal of improved successful resections and long-term outcomes.
 
For patients who present with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic disease, which represent a majority of PDA patients, management options range from chemotherapy alone to combined forms of treatment with radiation therapy and chemotherapy. However, due to the increased toxicity of combined treatment, randomized trials of such combined regimens have had low enrollment, precluding a firm conclusion as to any advantage of adding radiation to chemotherapy (Hidalgo 2010).
 
Gemcitabine was the first chemotherapeutic agent approved for the treatment of patients with PDA in the modern regulatory era, providing a median survival duration of 5.65 months (Burris 1997). Gemcitabine monotherapy was the standard of care for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer until combination therapy with gemcitabine plus erlotinib (Tarceva®) was shown to increase median survival by two weeks. This modest benefit was tempered by a significant side effect profile and high cost, limiting its adoption as a standard treatment regimen. Subsequently, the multidrug chemotherapy combination FOLFIRINOX was shown to provide a median survival benefit of 4.3 months (OS = 11.1 months) over gemcitabine alone (6.8 months), but its significant side effect profile limits the regimen to select patients with a good performance status and often requires supplementation with WBC growth factor therapy. Nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®) received marketing authorization for use in combination with gemcitabine (FDA approved 2013) after showing an increase in overall survival of seven weeks compared to gemcitabine alone (Von Hoff 2013). Thus, combination therapies have demonstrated a modest survival benefit compared to gemcitabine alone as summarized in the table below (Thota 2014).

Other drugs are currently under investigation, but none have received marketing authorization as a first-line treatment of PDA since the approval of Abraxane, Lynparza® (olaparib) was approved in December 2019 for maintenance therapy of patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA-mutated (gBRCAm) metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma whose disease has not progressed on at least 16 weeks of a first-line platinum-and chemotherapy regimen.
 

Familial adenomatous polyposis
 
Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a rare and potentially life threatening genetic condition occurring in approximately one in 10,000 individuals in the United States. FAP is caused primarily by mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor gene. APC mutations are usually inherited as autosomal dominant genetic traits, but as many as 25% of those afflicted with FAP with an identical germline mutation have no family history. Only 1 in 10,000 people will develop FAP. Estimated annual prevalence in the U.S. is approximately 30,000 and in Europe approximately 50,000. If untreated, patients will develop hundreds to thousands of polyps throughout the colon and rectum. FAP often develops in the early teens and results in a nearly 100% lifetime risk of colorectal cancer by age forty if untreated. No approved FAP drug is on the market.
 

Most patients are asymptomatic for years until the adenomas are large and numerous, and cause rectal bleeding or even anemia, or cancer develops. Generally, cancers start to develop a decade after the appearance of the polyps. Nonspecific symptoms may include constipation or diarrhea, abdominal pain, palpable abdominal masses and weight loss.
 
Cancer prevention and maintaining a good quality of life are the main goals of management of patients with FAP. By the late teens or early twenties, colorectal cancer prophylactic surgery is advocated. Prophylactic surgery often requires total abdominal colectomy with ileal-rectal anastomoses (IRA) and subsequent frequent endoscopic surveillance, with polypectomy and cautery/laser ablation as needed. Patients with extensive rectal involvement must undergo total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal reconstruction. Despite this, approximately 50% of patients who have had total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal reconstruction will develop adenomatous polyps in the neo-rectum (ileal pouch). Duodenal cancer and desmoids are the two main causes of mortality after total colectomy; they need to be identified early and treated. Upper endoscopy is necessary for surveillance to reduce the risk of ampullary and duodenal cancer. Patients with progressive tumors and unresectable disease may respond or stabilize with a combination of cytotoxic chemotherapy and surgery (when possible, to perform). Individuals with FAP carry a 100% risk of CRC; however, this risk is reduced significantly when patients enter a screening-treatment program.
 
    7 

  

A major unmet need in the treatment of patients with FAP is a therapeutic means to defer or obviate the need for major surgical interventions, particularly colectomy with IRA or proctocolectomy with an ileal surgical pouch (IPAA). Such interventions often require temporary or permanent ileostomy, and with it, long-term or permanent quality of life (QoL) deficits such as frequent bowel movements (average 6 per day), nocturnal fecal incontinence and, in female patients, reduced reproductive potential. It is critical to find non-surgical alternatives that will delay or obviate the need of repeated endoscopic and surgical procedures to maintain patient QoL. For those patients who have an intact colon in particular, pharmacotherapy offers the opportunity to meaningfully control or delay polyposis progression and offer a greater choice over when or if they undergo prophylactic colectomy/proctocolectomy in order to optimize QoL.
 
This potential benefit is in fact likely the most powerful potential benefit possible since the long-term course of FAP essentially mandates ultimate colectomy for most patients. The value to a younger patient in safely delaying such a radical procedure by years cannot be overstated.
 
There are currently no approved and marketed pharmacotherapeutic treatments for patients with FAP. While in 1999 celecoxib was conditionally approved by the FDA for the treatment of FAP based on reductions of polyp number observed in a randomized double-blind placebo controlled study conducted in patients with FAP, it was subject to the marketing authorization holder, Pfizer, providing additional data. In 2011, the FDA requested that Pfizer voluntarily withdraw the FAP indication for CELEBREX (celecoxib) Capsules from the market because the post-marketing study intended to verify clinical benefit and required as a condition of approval under subpart H was never completed. In a letter in 2011, Pfizer requested that the FDA withdraw the FAP indication for CELEBREX (celecoxib) Capsules from the market. Effective in 2012, the approval for the FAP indication for CELEBREX (celecoxib) Capsules was withdrawn. Celecoxib was also authorized for FAP treatment centrally by the European Commission after the EMA’s scientific review in October 2003 under “exceptional circumstances”. Authorization was granted subject to specific obligations during product life-cycle, chiefly to provide further data on its efficacy and safety; however, the applicant/authorization holder could not fulfill this central post-authorization obligation. According to publicly available information, the post- authorization study was initiated in the first quarter of 2004 and the EU Centralized Marketing Authorisation was withdrawn because the holder was unable to provide the data as required.
 

Ovarian Cancer
 
Worldwide Ovarian Cancer has annual incidence of approximately 314,000 and annual deaths of approximately 207,000 (Globocan 2020). In the United States, Ovarian represents approximately 1% of all new cancer cases at approximately 21,000 and the five year survival rate for metastatic disease is approximately 29% (SEER fact sheet Ovarian 2022). According to the American Cancer Society, ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women, accounting for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system.
 
Nearly 70 % of the patients are diagnosed with advanced-stage due to the failure of screening methods for detecting early-stage disease (Giornelli 2016; Partridge et al. 2009; Bast et al. 2007; Gohagan et al. 2000; Chudecka-Głaz 2015). Thus, most patients will relapse within the first 2 years after diagnosis, even after an optimal primary cytoreductive surgery and six cycles of the standard adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin/paclitaxel.
 
The second line chemotherapy depends mainly on the disease-free interval (DFI) (time between completion of first line chemotherapy and clinical relapse); or progression-free interval (PFI) (time between the last chemotherapy given for relapsed disease and progression). There are three classifications: Platinum-refractory/resistant with relapse during platinum treatment (refractory) or with a DFI/PFI <6 months (resistant), Platinum-sensitive relapse occurring >12 m of last platinum-based chemotherapy, or partially sensitive to platinum with disease-free survival (DFS)/ progression free survival (PFS) between 6 and 12 months from the last platinum-based chemotherapy.
 
According to Pignata et al. 2017, in platinum-sensitive patients, treatment with platinum-based combinations is associated with a PFS advantage compared with single agents or non-platinum combinations. For patients with partially sensitive relapse (PFI between 6 and 12 months), two options are available: platinum doublets or non-platinum therapy (single agent or combination). Last, patients with resistant or refractory relapse (PFI < 6 months) disease there are few options. For these patients, monotherapy with a non-platinum drug or participation in clinical trials is indicated.

Colorectal Cancer
 
According to United States Cancer Statistics published by the American Cancer Society, in the United States in 2022, it is estimated that CRC will be the third most commonly occurring cancer among males and females and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths. High-risk adenomatous polyps are considered the key risk factor for CRC. In 2015, the disease will be responsible for an estimated 52,000 deaths in the United States. An even higher rate of incidence occurs in the European Union, where approximately 255,000 people per year die from CRC according to the Globocan 2020 Fact Sheets.
 
Globally, there are approximately 1,931,000 new diagnoses each year (approximately 180,000 expected in North America in 2020). Rates of presentation are also becoming significant in Asia (China and Japan). Colorectal adenomas (or “polyps”) are considered the key risk factor for CRC. The general consensus in the medical and scientific communities is that these polyps are the precursors to more than 90% of all colorectal cancers.
 
Colon cancer represents nearly three-fourths of all colorectal cancers in the U.S. Despite potentially curative treatment with surgery (with or without adjuvant chemotherapy), local stage and locally-advanced stage colon cancer patients remain at considerable risk for colorectal adenomas, distant recurrence, secondary colonic tumor formation, and colorectal cancer related mortality. Polypectomy appears to be an effective way to decrease mortality from colon cancer but widespread adoption of this approach is limited by both cost and patient acceptability (Newcomb et al. 1992; Selby et al. 1992). Certain types of colorectal polyps have increased risk of progression to colorectal cancer. High-risk polyps (polyps with villous histology, size ≥ 1 cm, high grade dysplasia, or multiple adenomas defined as 3 or more) have become the focus of colorectal tumorigenesis research due to the higher rate of malignant potential for these lesion (Lotfi et al. 1986; Spencer et al. 1984; Winawer et al. 1993; Martinez et al. 2009). The current standard of care for resected colon cancer patient (beyond surgery, and adjuvant chemotherapy when indicated) is surveillance monitoring with clinical exams, laboratory analyses, and colonoscopic evaluation. However, data suggest that colonoscopy does not predict death from colorectal cancer uniformly throughout the colon – in fact, right-sided colorectal cancers were not observed to gain any mortality benefit from colonoscopy (Baxter et al. 2009). Other potential problems with colonoscopy include (rarely) perforations, infection, bleeding, and non-adherence with current recommendations. Safe and effective chemopreventive interventions, therefore, offer great potential to complement and improve upon the current colon cancer surveillance paradigm. Unlike other therapies used to treat CAT, Flynpovi is a non-surgical and non-invasive option that has the potential to both improve patient quality of life and reduce higher healthcare system-wide expense burdens.
 
Neuroblastoma
 
There are approximately 700 to 800 new cases of neuroblastoma (NB) each year in the United States, with a U.S. prevalence of 5,000 – 6,000 and this disease is found worldwide at similar rates (includes adults that had NB as children). About 50% of cases will be diagnosed as high-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NB) (Maris 2010). These individuals have the poorest survival prognosis. Time to first relapse (TTFR) is associated with overall survival (OS) in HR-NB patients that achieve an objective complete or partial response to initial therapy (London et al. 2011). Approximately 50% of the HR-NB patients will relapse and be eligible for this therapeutic approach.

Function and Characteristics of Polyamines
 
Polyamines are metabolically distinct entities within human cells that bind to and facilitate DNA replication, RNA transcription and processing, and protein (such as pancreatic enzymes) synthesis. Human cells contain three essential and naturally occurring polyamines – putrescine, spermidine, and spermine. Polyamines perform many functions necessary for cellular proliferation, apoptosis and protein synthesis. The critical balance of polyamines within cells is maintained by several enzymes such as ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and spermidine/spermine N1 acetyl transferase (SSAT). All of these homeostatic enzymes are short-lived, rapidly inducible intracellular proteins that serve to regulate native polyamine pools tightly and continuously. These enzymes constantly maintain polyamines within a very narrow range of concentration inside the cell.

Polyamine metabolism and cancer
 
Polyamines are required for cell proliferation. It is believed that many cancers, especially oncogene-driven cancers, might be sensitive to interference with polyamine metabolism. The natural polyamines putrescine, spermidine and spermine are intimately involved in growth-related processes, wound healing, and the development of cancer. Under normal conditions, the pool of polyamines is tightly controlled through regulation of synthesis, catabolism, and transport mechanisms (Gerner and Meyskens 2004). The loss of this tight control can result in an excessive accumulation of polyamines, which favors malignant transformation of cells. Consequently, with the loss of growth control in cancer cells, the transformed cells may be more sensitive to polyamine depletion than normal cells. Thus, the polyamine metabolic pathway is a rational target for therapeutic intervention (Casero 2018).
 
Immune systems require multiple soluble and cellular components, including polyamines, for a normal immune function. As such, polyamines are important modulators of the immune response, particularly in the tumor microenvironment where they are found in high concentrations. High levels of polyamines are present in tumor cells and in autoreactive B- and T-cells in autoimmune diseases. Dysregulation of polyamines can result in tumor immune evasion, elevated cell stress, and increased autoimmunity. By resetting the polyamine pathway through therapeutic interventions, there is the potential to restore normal immune functions.
 
Pharmacotherapeutic Approaches to Reset the Polyamine Pathway
 
The Company’s lead assets are ivospemin and Flynpovi, which provide a multi-targeted approach to reset dysregulated biology present in many types of diseases such as cancer and autoimmunity. For instance, many tumors require greatly elevated levels of polyamines to support their growth and survival. These agents target the polyamine pathway at complementary junctions which have been shown to be altered is disease. In particular, these agents have the potential to suppress and prevent tumor growth, enhance anti-tumor activity of other anti-cancer agents, and modulate the immune system.

Polyamine Analogue - ivospemin (SBP-101)
 
Many tumors, including pancreatic cancer, display an increased uptake rate of polyamines. Polyamine analogues such as ivospemin are structurally similar to naturally occurring polyamines and are recognized by the cell’s polyamine uptake system, allowing these compounds to gain ready entrance to the cell. We believe that pancreatic acinar cells, because of their extraordinary protein synthesis capacity, exhibit enhanced uptake of polyamines and polyamine analogues. Because of this preferential uptake by pancreatic acinar cells, polyamine analogues such as ivospemin disrupt the cell’s polyamine balance and biosynthetic network, and induce programmed cell death, or apoptosis, via processes including caspase 3 activation and poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Proof of concept has been demonstrated in multiple human pancreatic cancer models, both in vivo and in vitro, that pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma exhibits sensitivity to ivospemin.
 
Ivospemin is a proprietary polyamine analogue, which we believe accumulates in the exocrine pancreas acinar cells due to its unique chemical structure. ivospemin was discovered and extensively studied by Professor Raymond J. Bergeron at the University of Florida College of Pharmacy.
 
As laboratory studies suggest, the primary mechanism of action for ivospemin has been demonstrated to include the enhanced uptake of the compound in the exocrine pancreas; therefore, pancreatic cancer was logical for the initial development of this compound. Sufficiently high dosing in animal models leads to correspondingly depressed levels of native polyamines, with caspase 3 activation, PARP cleavage and apoptotic destruction (programmed cell death) of the exocrine pancreatic acinar and ductal cells without an inflammatory response. Importantly, pancreatic islet cells, which secrete insulin, are structurally and functionally dissimilar to acinar cells and are not impacted by ivospemin. In animal models at two independent laboratories, ivospemin has demonstrated significant suppression of transplanted human pancreatic cancer cells, including metastatic pancreatic cancer growth.
 
    11 

  

We believe that ivospemin exploits the natural affinity of the exocrine pancreas, the liver and kidney, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells while leaving the insulin-producing islet cells unharmed. Most current cancer therapies, including chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery, are associated with significant side effects that further reduce the patient’s quality of life. However, based on data evaluated from clinical studies to date, we believe that the adverse effects of ivospemin in causing bone marrow suppression or peripheral neuropathy do not overlap with or exacerbate those seen with typical chemotherapy options. The dose-limiting toxicities observed in cohort five of our first Phase I study, as noted below, were not observed at lower doses and are not expected to overlap with the adverse events of bone marrow suppression and peripheral neuropathy commonly associated with standard chemotherapy. The dose and dosing schedule evaluated in the expansion phase of the recently completed Phase Ia/Ib is below the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) and at this dose level, neither the exocrine nor the endocrine human pancreas is expected to be affected by ivospemin, resulting in no treatment impact on pancreatic enzyme or insulin levels. This dose level and dosing schedule in the new ASPIRE trial will be the same as evaluated in the expansion phase of the Ia/Ib study.
 
Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitor - eflornithine (CPP-1X)
 
Ornithine decarboxylase is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of polyamines which catalyzes the conversion of ornithine to putrescine and regulates the biosynthesis of polyamines in mammalian as well as many other eukaryotic cells. Eflornithine, also known as α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), is an ornithine analogue. Eflornithine irreversibly binds to ODC1 and prevents the natural ODC1 substrate, ornithine, from accessing the active site of the enzyme (Meyskens and Gerner 1999). The administration of eflornithine decreases both ODC activity and polyamine concentrations. In genetic mouse models with an APC gene mutation, the administration of eflornithine reduces intestinal carcinogenesis, decreasing the concentration of polyamines through transport and catabolism and inhibiting tumor development (Babbar et al. 2003).
 
Treatment of animals with eflornithine results in inhibition of ODC activity, especially in tissues and organs with rapidly dividing cells. Polyamine biosynthesis has been shown to be critical for eukaryotic cellular growth and differentiation, and inhibition of polyamine biosynthesis can stimulate or inhibit cellular differentiation depending on the model studied (Gerner and Meyskens 2004). Accordingly, eflornithine has promoted or inhibited cell differentiation in a variety of models.
 
Polyamine biosynthesis is also a critical step in experimental chemical-induced carcinogenesis, cell transformation, and tumor cell proliferation, and there is a growing body of evidence that eflornithine's inhibitory effect on cell proliferation and tumorigenesis may involve a complex inter-relationship between oncogenes, polyamine metabolism, and ODC activity. MYC is an oncogene that encodes a transcription factor that is required for the proliferation of normal cells but when overexpressed can lead to aberrant cell growth (Gerner and Meyskens 2004). Additionally, c-Myc is a transcriptional activator of the ODC gene (Pena et al. 1993) (Bello-Fernandez, Packham, and Cleveland 1993). Furthermore, eflornithine has been shown to decrease N-Myc mRNA in neuroblastoma cells and c-Myc mRNA in human colon carcinoma cells (Celano et al. 1988) and spermidine preferentially stimulated transcription and expression of c-Myc, but not c-Fos (Tabib and Bachrach 1999). Taken together, these results suggest that polyamines play a feedback role in the regulation of expression of certain oncogenes at the level of transcription.
 
Mice with a mutation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) tumor suppressor gene develop intestinal tumors in numbers similar to those found in patients with FAP. Mutations of the Apc gene increases the activity of ODC and leads to increased intestinal polyamine levels. Studies in animal models of FAP indicate that eflornithine alone is effective in reducing the number of intestinal tumors (Erdman et al. 1999b) and colonic tumor burden (Yerushalmi et al. 2006). Eflornithine may lower polyamine levels in colorectal mucosa and skin cells (Gerner and Meyskens 2004).
 
The major clinical evidence for benefit of eflornithine derives from prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies of eflornithine monotherapy in patients with elevated risk for developing certain forms of cancer (prostate and basal cell skin cancer). In a randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical study in subjects with a history of resected colon polyps, eflornithine reduced polyamines in rectal mucosal tissue. This marker study is especially relevant to patients with FAP, in whom target tissues include intestinal and colonic mucosa (Meyskens et al. 1998).
 
Eflornithine has received regulatory approvals as a high dose, intravenously delivered medication for the treatment of a form of African sleeping sickness, and as a topical agent for the treatment of hirsutism (excess hair growth on body parts where hair growth is usually absent or minimal). No oral dosage form of eflornithine has ever received regulatory approval in any indication.

Activator of Spermidine/Spermine N-Acetyltransferase (SSAT1) – Sulindac
 
Transport of polyamines is maintained by the peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor-g (PPARg). This receptor positively regulates SSAT transcription facilitating polyamine acetylation and transport of polyamines out of the cell. Under normal conditions, the K-Ras molecule has no activity on PPARg. However, mutation of the K-Ras gene produces a product that inhibits PPARg’s effect on SSAT translation resulting in elevated polyamine pools and tumorigenesis (Babbar et al. 2003). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as sulindac, act through PPARg to enhance transcriptional of SSAT which increases catabolism and export of polyamines.
 
Sulindac is a member of the arylalkanoic acid class of NSAIDs and is a non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenases involved in prostaglandin synthesis. To understand potential mechanisms of action of sulindac, patterns of gene expression resulting from treatment with sulindac sulfone, a sulindac metabolite lacking cyclooxygenase inhibitory activity, were measured in human colon tumor-derived cells (Babbar et al. 2003). Sulindac sulfone inhibited cell growth, and induced apoptosis and the expression of spermidine/spermine N-acetyltransferase (SSAT1), a polyamine catabolic enzyme implicated in polyamine export (Xie, Gillies, and Gerner 1997). Sulindac sulfone induction of SAT1 expression occurs via a cyclooxygenase-independent transcriptional activation of SAT1 at a specific peroxisomal proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) responsive element (PPRE) in the SAT1 gene. Treatment of cells with sulindac sulfone induces SAT1 expression and stimulates polyamine export.
 
Experimental findings in human cell and mouse models indicate that sulindac and other NSAIDS activate polyamine catabolism (Gerner and Meyskens 2009). Thus, NSAIDs complement inhibitors of polyamine synthesis, like eflornithine, to reduce tissue polyamine levels. In cell culture, sulindac metabolites reduce cell survival in vitro in a dose-dependent manner at doses above 150 µM at 24-hour exposure times (Lawson et al. 2000).
 
Experiments in both mouse and rat models of colon cancer have demonstrated a preventative effect for sulindac (Babbar et al. 2003). Sulindac blocked tumor formation in the multiple intestinal neoplasia (Min) mouse, a murine model of APC mutation-associated intestinal carcinogenesis, mimicking FAP. In the Min mouse, tumor-preventing doses of sulindac inhibited tissue levels of prostaglandin-E2 and COX-2 (Boolbol et al. 1996). In other nonclinical studies, sulindac had an inhibitory effect on bladder, lung, and forestomach tumor formation in rat and mouse models (Kelloff, Boone, et al. 1994, Kelloff, Crowell, et al. 1994).
 

Dual Targeting - Flynpovi
 
The ability to decrease the polyamine pools by a dual mechanism of action, i.e., suppressed synthesis and enhanced catabolism and export, led to the hypothesis that Flynpovi would complement one another in the prevention of tumor development in a patient population where elevated polyamine pools lead to enhanced tumorigenesis. Eflornithine is the irreversible inhibitor of ODC which is responsible for de novo synthesis of polyamines and sulindac regulates SSAT which plays a role in polyamine export and catabolism. Hence the combination, Flynpovi, inhibits the generation of new polyamines and also removes polyamines obtained from the diet and microbiome.
 
The ability of Flynpovi to reduce polyamines in the GI tract has been demonstrated in both the preclinical and clinical settings. In the study by Igantenko et al, the effect of eflornithine alone and in combination with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) sulindac or celecoxib on intestinal tumor number and grade and polyamine content was evaluated in ApcMin/+ mice (Ignatenko et al. 2008). Administration of eflornithine in combination with sulindac was superior to each single agent at significantly (P< 0.05) decreasing putrescine, spermidine, and total intestinal polyamine concentrations to below baseline levels in the ApcMin/+ mice. Additionally, in this study with the exception of the 0.5% eflornithine treatment group, all treatment groups developed significantly (P<0.05) fewer tumors/animal than the control group. The combination treatment of 2% eflornithine and sulindac suppressed intestinal tumorigenesis to a level that was not statistically significantly different from that for sulindac alone. Although sulindac alone produced a significant decrease in the number of intestinal tumors in ApcMin/+ mice, it did not reduce the percentage of high‑grade adenomas. However, the combination of eflornithine and sulindac significantly (P<0.05) decreased the number of high-grade adenomas compared to the sulindac alone group.
 
    13 

  

The ability of the eflornithine and sulindac treatment group to suppress high grade adenomas is a key finding as it is the high grade adenomas in this model which correlate to the high grade adenomas seen in FAP patients that are indicators for excisional and surgical events clinically. These data support the rationale for treatment of FAP patients with eflornithine combined with sulindac to reduce intestinal polyamine contents and the incidence of high-grade intestinal adenomas.
 
More importantly, combination treatment with Flynpovi dramatically reduces the incidence of metachronous colorectal adenomas in patients with prior sporadic adenomas (Meyskens et al. 2008). Meyskens and colleagues performed a Phase IIb/III, double-blind pharmacoprevention of Sporadic Colorectal Adenomas Study (PSCA Study) in which 375 subjects who had resected sporadic adenoma were treated for 3 years with eflornithine (500 mg once a day) + sulindac (150 mg once a day [N = 191]) or matched placebo/placebo (N = 184). Results demonstrated a marked risk reduction (70%) in developing metachronous adenomas, 92% risk reduction in developing advanced adenomas, and 95% risk reduction in developing multiple adenomas with the active combination regimen compared to placebo. This combination regimen was generally well tolerated.
 
The mechanism of disease in sporadic and FAP-associated adenomatous polyposis, and the mechanism of eflornithine and NSAID action in prevention of progressive polyposis in both the general population with sporadic adenomas and in patients with FAP, led to the development of the FAP-310 trial in patients with FAP associated with APC germline mutations.
 
The FAP-310 Phase III study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of the combination of eflornithine and sulindac, as compared with either drug alone, in adults with familial adenomatous polyposis was conducted (Burke et al. 2020). The patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive eflornithine, sulindac, or both once daily for up to 48 months. In a post-hoc analysis, none of the patients in the combination arm progressed to a need for lower gastrointestinal (LGI) surgery for up to 48 months compared with 7 (13.2%) and 8 (15.7%) patients in the sulindac and eflornithine arms (Balaguer et al. 2022). These data corresponded to risk reductions for the need for LGI surgery approaching 100% between combination and either monotherapy with HR = 0.00 (95% CI, 0.00-0.48; P= 0.005) for combination versus sulindac and HR = 0.00 (95% CI, 0.00-0.44; P= 0.003) for combination versus eflornithine.
 
Development Plan for Ivospemin (SBP-101) 
 
Development of ivospemin for the pancreatic cancer indication has included a pre-clinical and a clinical phase. The pre-clinical phase, which was substantially completed during 2015, consisted of four primary components: chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC), preclinical (laboratory and animal) pharmacology studies, preclinical toxicology studies, and regulatory submissions in Australia and the United States.
 
Preparation of the ivospemin IND for pancreatic cancer required collaboration by our manufacturing, preclinical toxicology, pharmacokinetic, and metabolism experts, our regulatory affairs project management, and our in-house clinical expertise. In August 2015, the FDA accepted our application.

In Australia, a Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) application was submitted with subsequent Clinical Trial Notification (CTN) to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA).
 
Our initial clinical trial in previously treated patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer was a Phase I, first-in-human, dose-escalation, safety study conducted at clinical sites in both Australia and the United States. We engaged expert clinicians who treat pancreatic cancer at major cancer treatment centers in Melbourne and Adelaide, Australia as well as the Mayo Clinic Scottsdale and HonorHealth in Scottsdale, Arizona. These Key Opinion Leaders, with proven performance in pancreatic cancer studies, agreed to participate as investigators for our Phase I First-in-Human study.
 
    14 

  

Enrollment in our initial Phase I safety trial of ivospemin in previously treated pancreatic cancer patients commenced in January 2016 and was completed in September 2017. Results from this trial are discussed in ivospemin (SBP-101) Clinical Development – Pancreatic Cancer, Phase I Clinical Trial Design and Completion (ivospemin Monotherapy) below.
 
We completed enrollment of patients in our second clinical trial in December 2020. This second clinical trial was a Phase Ia/Ib study of the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of ivospemin administered in combination with two standard-of-care chemotherapy agents, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. A total of 25 subjects were enrolled in four cohorts of Phase Ia and an additional 25 subjects were enrolled in the expansion Phase Ib by December of 2020. Safety and interim efficacy results from this trial are discussed in ivospemin (SBP-101) Clinical Development - Pancreatic Cancer, Phase Ia/Ib Clinical Trial Interim Results (First Line Combination Therapy) below.
 
In January of 2022, we initiated our third clinical trial. This new trial is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study of safety and efficacy of ivospemin administered in combination with two standard-of-care chemotherapy agents, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. Trial design and expected timing are discussed in Clinical Development - Pancreatic Cancer, Randomized Clinical Trial Design and Anticipated Timing (ASPIRE trial).
 
In addition, we are exploring ivospemin for neoadjuvant treatment in appropriate pancreatic cancer patients. There is also preclinical data to suggest that ivospemin may have potential therapeutic uses for cancers other than pancreatic. In February 2021, we entered into a research agreement with the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The collaboration has focused on the further development of Panbela’s investigative agent ivospemin, including activity in cell lines outside of pancreatic cancer, biomarkers informing diagnostics and potential combination with checkpoint inhibitors. In December 2021, the Company announced positive preclinical data supporting the activity of ivospemin in ovarian cancer cell lines which was presented and published in 2022 (Holbert et al. 2022). Further data resulting from the ongoing relationship with Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine is expected.

Phase I Clinical Trial Design and Completion (ivospemin Monotherapy)
 
We have completed an initial clinical trial of ivospemin in patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. This was a Phase I, first-in-human, dose-escalation, safety study. From January 2016 through September 2017, we enrolled twenty-nine patients into six cohorts, or groups, in the dose-escalation phase of the Phase I trial. No drug-related bone marrow toxicity or peripheral neuropathy was observed at any dose level. In addition to being evaluated for safety, 23 of the 29 patients were evaluable for preliminary signals of efficacy prior to or at the eight-week conclusion of their first cycle of treatment using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (“RECIST”), the currently accepted standard for evaluating change in the size of tumors.
 
The absence of adverse events which could potentially overlap with adverse events typically observed in the use of conventional chemotherapeutic agents, supports the case for combination of ivospemin with conventional chemotherapeutic agents, such as gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel, or even FOLFIRINOX.
 
Phase Ia/Ib Clinical Trial Interim Results (First Line Combination Therapy)
 
In 2018, we began enrolling patients in our second clinical trial, a Phase Ia/Ib study of the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of ivospemin administered in combination with two standard-of-care chemotherapy agents, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. A total of 25 subjects were enrolled in 4 cohorts to evaluate the dosage level and schedule. An additional 25 subjects were enrolled in the expansion phase of the trial. Interim results were presented in January of 2022. Best response in evaluable subjects (cohorts 4 and Ib N=29) was a CR in 1 (3%), PR in 13 (45%), SD in 10 (34%) and PD in 5 (17%). One subject did not have post baseline scans with RECIST tumor assessments. Median PFS, now final at 6.5 months, may have been negatively impacted by drug dosing interruptions to evaluate potential toxicity. Median overall survival in Cohort 4 + Phase Ib was 12.0 months when data was presented in January 2022 and is now final at 14.6 months. Two patients from cohort 2 have demonstrated long term survival: one at 30.3 months (final data) and one at 33.0 months and still alive. Seven subjects are still alive as of the date of this report, one from cohort 2 and six from cohort 4 plus Ib.

Randomized Clinical Trial design and anticipated timing (ASPIRE trial)
 
In January of 2022, the Company announced the initiation of a new clinical trial. Referred to as ASPIRE, the trial is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, a standard pancreatic cancer treatment regimen in patients previously untreated for metastatic pancreatic cancer. The trial will be conducted globally at approximately 95 sites in the United States, Europe and Asia - Pacific.
 
While opening of clinical sites in the United States and the rest of the world has been slower than originally anticipated, due in part to resource fatigue in the medical community, the Company expects all countries and sites to be open by mid- 2023.
 
The trial was originally designed as a Phase II/III trial with a smaller sample size (150) to support the events required for interim analysis based on Progression Free Survival (PFS) and a primary endpoint of overall survival (OS). In response to European and FDA regulatory feedback, the study was amended to include the total trial sample size (600) and the design modified to utilize overall survival as the primary endpoint to be examined at interim analysis. PFS will also be analyzed to provide additional efficacy evidence. This amendment was supported by the final data from the Phase Ia/Ib first line metastatic pancreatic cancer trial which completed enrollment in December of 2020. The study will enroll 600 subjects and is anticipated to take 36 months for complete enrollment with the interim analysis available in early 2024. 
 
If we can successfully complete all FDA recommended clinical studies, we intend to seek marketing authorization from the FDA, the EMA (European Union), Ministry of Health and Welfare (Japan) and TGA (Australia). The submission fees may be waived when ivospemin (SBP-101) has been designated an orphan drug in each geographic region, as described under “Orphan Drug Status.”
 
Development Plan for Flynpovi and Eflornithine (CPP-1X)
 
In December 2009, the FDA accepted CPP’s IND application for the combination product, Flynpovi, product candidate and in November 2009 and August 2018, the FDA accepted IND applications for eflornithine.
 
    16 

  

The Development plan executed by CPP of Flynpovi for FAP and colon cancer prevention has included both a pre-clinical/non-clinical and a clinical phase. The non-clinical phase consisted of four primary components: CMC, preclinical (laboratory and animal) pharmacology studies, preclinical toxicology studies, and regulatory submissions in the U.S. and Europe. Similarly, the development plan for eflornithine and eflornithine sachets in several different indications included much of the same primary components and regulatory submission in the U.S.
 
Clinical Development –Flynpovi
 
Our clinical development of Flynpovi thus far includes:
 

● | The FAP-310 Phase III
--+----------------------


● | The PACES Phase III Trial
--+--------------------------

FAP-310 Phase III Trial
 
In the FAP-310 Phase III study, the efficacy and safety of the combination of Flynpovi (ES combo), as compared with either drug eflornithine or sulindac alone, in adults with FAP was conducted. A total of 171 patients underwent randomization. Disease progression occurred in 18 of 56 patients (32%) in the Flynpovi, 22 of 58 (38%) in the sulindac group, and 23 of 57 (40%) in the eflornithine group, with a hazard ratio of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.39 to 1.32) for Flynpovi as compared with sulindac (P = 0.29) and 0.66 (95% CI, 0.36 to 1.23) for Flynpovi as compared with eflornithine. In a post-hoc analysis, none of the patients in the combination arm progressed to a need for LGI surgery for up to 48 months compared with 7 (13.2%) and 8 (15.7%) patients in the sulindac and eflornithine arms. These data corresponded to risk reductions for the need for LGI surgery approaching 100% between combination and either monotherapy with HR = 0.00 (95% CI, 0.00–0.48; P = 0.005) for combination versus sulindac and HR = 0.00 (95% CI, 0.00–0.44; P = 0.003) for combination versus eflornithine.
 

Given the statistical significance of the LGI group, an NDA was filed with the FDA. As the study failed to meet the primary endpoint, and the NDA was based on the results of an exploratory analysis, a complete response letter was issued. To address this deficiency concern, the Company must submit the results of one or more adequate and well-controlled clinical trials which demonstrate an effect on a clinical endpoint. We are working closely with our North American licensee, One-Two, designing a Phase III registration trial for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) to address the CRL. One-Two will manage the trial and the NDA process with the FDA. The Company will be responsible for the approvals in ROW.
 
Phase III Clinical Trial in Colon Cancer Survivors
 
In collaboration with the NCI, and SWOG, a Phase III clinical trial has been initiated to study the benefits of Flynpovi as a therapeutic treatment for use by colon cancer survivors. The trial is named PACES for “Prevention of Adenomas and Cancer with eflornithine and sulindac.” The PACES trial is funded by the NCI and managed by SWOG. This is an ongoing double blind placebo-controlled trial of Flynpovi to prevent recurrence of high risk adenomas and second primary colorectal cancers in patients with stage 0-III colon or rectal cancer, Phase III PACES. The purpose of this study is to assess whether the Flynpovi, combination of eflornithine and sulindac, (compared to corresponding placebos) has a reduced rate of cancer or high-risk adenoma recurrence compared to comparator arms after three years of daily dosing. We have exclusive rights to the data that comes from the trial for regulatory and commercial purposes. One-Two has licensed the program for North America and the Company is evaluating its options for CAT in the European Union and Asia.

Phase II Neuroblastoma (NB) Trial
 
Neuroblastoma is a form of cancer that occurs in infants and young children, affecting the peripheral nervous system.
 
Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC1) encodes the first enzyme in polyamine synthesis in mammals and is a direct transcriptional target of MYC (Bello-Fernandez, Packham, and Cleveland 1993; Pena et al. 1993). ODC1 and other genes in the polyamine pathway are crucial elements of MYCN oncogenesis in neuroblastoma (Hogarty et al. 2008; Rounbehler et al. 2009; Geerts et al. 2010). ODC1 and MYCN are also located nearby on chromosome 2, and a subset of MYCN amplified tumors have also been shown to co-amplify ODC1 (Hogarty et al. 2008). High ODC1, either in the presence or absence of MYCN amplifications, correlates with poor clinical outcome of reduced event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) (Hogarty et al. 2008). Several genes in the polyamine pathway, including ODC1, have been shown to be independent negative prognostic factors for neuroblastoma (Hogarty et al. 2008; Rounbehler et al. 2009; Geerts et al. 2010). The most common genetic alteration in NB is MYCN where amplifications occur in approximately 20-25% of all cases and are associated with the high-risk phenotype (Seeger et al. 1985; Brodeur et al. 1984). Additionally, High-Risk-NB that lacks MYCN amplifications have MYCN deregulation through other mechanisms. MYCN is a well-documented poor prognostic risk factor for children with neuroblastoma (Schwab 1993).
 
Panbela is engaged with leading pediatric oncology research cooperatives in the United States and the UK to explore the feasibility of treating neuroblastoma with our CPP-1XS, a high dose powder dosage form of eflornithine. The Children’s Oncology Group and the NCI are performing a Phase II study evaluating CPP-1X-S 6.75 g/m2 daily to treat relapsed, refractory, or progressive neuroblastoma in combination with standard of care immunotherapy and chemotherapy. The trial has passed a futility analysis and is ongoing. The Company has received orphan drug designations for the use of eflornithine for the treatment of neuroblastoma in the United States and Europe.
 
Phase II Gastric Cancer Prevention Trial
 
H. pylori is the most common bacterial infection in humans and causes gastritis in all individuals. Gastritis progresses along the “Correa cascade” from gastritis to the precancerous stages of atrophic gastritis (loss of specialized gastric epithelium) and intestinal metaplasia (IM), to gastric adenocarcinoma (Correa 1992). In response to H. pylori infection the host elicits a robust innate and adaptive immune response, which results in mucosal inflammation but fails to eradicate the organism. Several studies have demonstrated that the failure of the immune response may be related to dysregulated L-arginine metabolism and polyamines including the upregulation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) by macrophages (Chaturvedi et al. 2010; Chaturvedi, de Sablet, Coburn, et al. 2012) (Chaturvedi, de Sablet, Peek, et al. 2012), (Chaturvedi et al. 2011) (Xu et al. 2004) (Chaturvedi et al. 2014) (Chaturvedi et al. 2004). Levels of polyamines are increased in H. pylori-induced gastritis in mice, and oral DFMO treatment reduces gastric polyamine levels, and severity of both H. pylori colonization and gastritis (Chaturvedi et al. 2010). In the gerbil model of H. pylori-induced gastric cancer, polyamine levels correlate with levels of gastritis, DNA damage, and progression to dysplasia/carcinoma. In this model, eflornithine reduces polyamine levels and DNA damage, and reduces rates of dysplasia and carcinoma by >50% (Chaturvedi et al. 2014).

In collaboration with investigators at Vanderbilt University and funding by the NCI, the investigator-initiated Phase II trial performed in Honduras and Puerto Rico was a randomized, double-blinded study comparing once daily eflornithine versus placebo for an up to 18-month treatment period in patients with gastric premalignant lesions. This trial has completed and is undergoing data analysis. The Company has received orphan drug designation for the use of eflornithine for the treatment of gastric cancer in the United States.
 
Phase I and II Recent Onset Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) Trials 
 
T1D is an organ-specific autoimmune disease characterized by chronic immune-mediated destruction of pancreatic β-cells, leading to partial, or in most cases, absolute insulin deficiency. The majority of cases result from autoimmune mediated pancreatic β-cell destruction, which occurs at a variable rate. Patients become clinically symptomatic when approximately 90% of pancreatic β-cells are destroyed. Therefore, preserving β-cell function is a target for promising treatments (Couper et al. 2014). The activity of ODC is upregulated in early diabetic kidney disease, contributing to renal hypertrophy and hyperfiltration (Pedersen et al. 1992; Deng et al. 2003). In vivo studies in experimental models of recent-onset T1D evaluating eflornithine demonstrate roles in suppressing the development of renal hypertrophy and hyperplasia, decreasing the incidence of diabetes, augmenting the survival and regeneration of β-cell populations, decreasing insulinitis, and maintaining an immune-tolerant balance of T-cell subpopulations.
 
The Company collaborated with investigators at Indiana University on a JDRF funded Phase I study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of increasing doses of eflornithine in patients with recent onset Type 1 diabetes. The completed Phase I trial demonstrated that a 3-month course of oral eflornithine was well tolerated with a favorable adverse event profile in children and adults with recent-onset T1D. Urinary polyamine data showed that eflornithine treatment inhibited ornithine decarboxylase activity effectively, reflected by a dose dependent reduction in urinary putrescine values. Furthermore, although not powered to detect metabolic efficacy, subjects treated with 750 mg/m2/day and 1000 mg/m2/day of eflornithine exhibited higher C-peptide AUC 6 months after treatment indicative of improved β cell function compared to placebo. These data suggest that eflornithine may improve β cell function alone and in combination regimens to treat or prevent type 1 diabetes that also include immunotherapy. A larger Phase II study fully powered to detect an effect of eflornithine treatment on maintenance of C-peptide is being planned with the goal of initiating in early 2023.
 
Phase I/II STK-11 Mutant NSCLC Trial
 
STK11 is the fourth-most frequently mutated gene in lung adenocarcinoma, with loss of function occurring in up to 30% of all cases (Laderian et al. 2020). Patients with LKB1 loss have reduced infiltrates of cytotoxic T-cells and respond poorly to anti PD1 or anti-PDL-1 therapies regardless of the PDL-1 status. CheckMate-057 trial lung tumors harboring co-mutations in KRAS and STK11 had an inferior response to PD-1 axis inhibitors (Skoulidis et al. 2018). These results suggest that STK11-mutated tumors were found to have a cold immune microenvironment regardless of KRAS status.
 
Bioinformatic analyses using two well-annotated lung adenocarcinoma datasets identified upregulation of ornithine decarboxylase (the target for eflornithine). Additionally, LKB1-loss tumors show a significant up-regulation of several solute transporters (SLC7A2, SLC14A2, and SLC16A4). SLC7A2 is known to be responsible for the membrane transport of cationic amino acids arginine, lysine, and ornithine. Furthermore, LKB1 loss the arginine pathway in which arginine is converted to ornithine and urea (by arginase) and ornithine is converted to putrescine (by ODC1). Together, the results suggested that ODC1 may be a key metabolic driver in LKB1-loss lung cancer.
 
In other model systems eflornithine treatment has been shown to modulate the tumor microenvironment. A previously studied cohort revealed that ODC1 may be instrumental to immune suppression (Chamaillard et al. 1997). Since eflornithine is an ODC1 inhibitor, it is hypothesized that inhibiting the metabolic enzyme ODC1 using eflornithine will increase the number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in LKB1-loss tumors and restore benefit of PD(L)-1 blockade to these patients.
 
The Company is currently planning a Phase I/II investigator-initiated trial to assess eflornithine in patients with STK-11 mutant NSCLC with the goal of starting in early 2023.

Total Development Costs
 
The development of ivospemin involves a preclinical and a clinical development phase. We have completed our initial preclinical development work for pancreatic cancer as well as two Phase I clinical trials. The Phase II/III trial has just been initiated. Additional clinical trials will likely be required for FDA or other approvals in foreign jurisdictions if the results of the first-line clinical trial of our ivospemin product candidate justify continued development. The cost and timing of additional clinical trials is highly dependent on the nature and size of the trials.
 
The development of Flynpovi also has involved preclinical and clinical development work for FAP and colon cancer prevention. CPP is party to a licensing and development agreement giving exclusive rights to commercialize and develop Flynpovi in North America. The licensing and development agreement calls for the cost of development and obtaining approval in North America to be borne by the licensing partner. A registration trial in FAP is expected to begin in mid-2023.
 
Orphan Drug Status
 
The Orphan Drug Act provides special status to drugs which are intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States, or that affect more than 200,000 persons but for which a manufacturer is not expected to recover the costs of developing and marketing such a drug. Orphan drug designation has the advantage of reducing drug development costs by: (i) streamlining the FDA’s approval process, (ii) providing tax breaks for expenses related to the drug development, (iii) allowing the orphan drug manufacturer to receive assistance from the FDA in funding the clinical testing necessary for approval of an orphan drug, and (iv) facilitating drug development efforts. More significantly, the orphan drug manufacturer’s ability to recover its investment in developing the drug is also greatly enhanced by the FDA granting the manufacturer seven years of exclusive U.S. marketing rights upon approval. Designation of a product candidate as an orphan drug therefore may provide its sponsor with the opportunity to adopt a faster and less expensive pathway to commercializing its product.
 
We obtained U.S. Orphan Drug Status for ivospemin in 2014. On December 14, 2022, we announced that the EMA Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products issued a positive opinion on Panbela’s application for orphan designation of ivospemin (SBP-101) in combination with gemcitabine and nab Paclitaxel in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
 
We have obtained orphan drug designation status for Flynpovi and eflornithine for FAP in the United States (2013 and 2011 respectively) and Europe (2013 and 2011 respectively). In addition, we have received orphan drug designation status for eflornithine as a single agent for neuroblastoma in the United States (2010) and Europe (2011) and for gastric cancer (2015) in the United States.
 
Fast Track
 
In June 2020, we received Fast Track Designation from the FDA for development of ivospemin for the treatment of first-line patients with metastatic PDA when administered in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel.
 
Additionally, in September 2017, we received Fast Track Designation from the FDA for the development of Flynpovi for the treatment of FAP.
 
With the designation of Fast Track Designation, we, or our North American partners, may engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, and the FDA may review sections of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if we provide, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Additionally, Fast Track Designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.

Intellectual Property
 
As the result of efforts at our contract manufacturer Syngene International Ltd to refine the synthetic process, a new shorter synthetic process has been developed on which a patent (US 11,098,005 B2) “METHODS FOR PRODUCING (65,155)-3,8,13,18-TETRAAZAICOSANE-6, 15-DIOL” issued on Aug. 24, 2021 and was assigned to Panbela. The patent claims cover a novel process for the production of ivospemin and reduces the number of synthetic steps from nineteen to six.
 
For Flynpovi, there is a composition of matter patent for the fixed dose combination of eflornithine and sulindac that is broadly nationalized, providing potential protection through 2037. Additionally, we hold several Method of Use patents for Flynpovi and/or eflornithine for the treatment of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis, neuroblastoma, and the Treatment of Recent Onset Type 1 Diabetes.
 
We are evaluating other opportunities to provide additional intellectual property.
 
Human Capital Management
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had seven employees, six of which were full time. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.
 
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors, and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to motivate such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives and lead to the success of the Company and increase value to our stockholders.
 
We value diversity of backgrounds and perspectives in our workforce and our policy is that we do not discriminate based on race, religion, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, military and veteran status, sexual orientation or any other protected characteristic as established by federal, state or local laws.
 
We believe that operational responsibilities can be handled by our current employees, independent consultants and our global CRO. We have historically used the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services. We believe that this use of third-party service providers enhances our ability to minimize general and administrative expenses. We intend to periodically evaluate our staffing and talent requirements and expect to add employees if that becomes a more appropriate resourcing alternative.
 
Competition
 
The development and commercialization of new products to treat cancer is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face substantial competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, and biotechnology companies worldwide. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, and human resources. Smaller and early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. As a result, our competitors may discover, develop, license or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.
 
We face competition with respect to our current product candidates and will face competition with respect to future product candidates, from segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that pursue approaches to targeting molecular alterations and signaling pathways associated with cancer. Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we do or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more convenient, less costly, or possessing better safety profiles than our products, and these competitors may be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products.
 
    21 

  

In addition, we may need to develop our product candidates in collaboration with diagnostic companies, and we will face competition from other companies in establishing these collaborations. Our competitors will also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 
Furthermore, we also face competition more broadly across the market for cost-effective and reimbursable cancer treatments. The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted drug therapy or a combination of such methods. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While our product candidates, if any are approved, may compete with these existing drug and other therapies, to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our product candidates may be approved as companion treatments and not be competitive with current therapies. Some of these drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products or specific branded products. We expect that if our product candidates are approved, they will be priced at a premium over competitive generic, including branded generic, products. As a result, obtaining market acceptance of, and gaining significant share of the market for, any of our product candidates that we successfully introduce to the market will pose challenges. In addition, many companies are developing new therapeutics and we cannot predict what the standard of care will be as our product candidate progresses through clinical development.
 
Commercialization
 
We have not established a sales, marketing or product distribution infrastructure nor have we devoted significant management resources to planning such an infrastructure because our lead product candidate is still in early clinical development. We currently anticipate that we will partner with a larger pharmaceutical organization having the expertise and capacity to perform these functions.
 
Flynpovi will be commercialized, if approved, in North America by One-Two.
 
Manufacturing and Suppliers
 
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing as well as for commercial manufacture of any products that we may commercialize. If needed, we intend to engage, by entering into a supply agreement or through another arrangement, third-party manufacturers to provide us with additional SBP-101 clinical supply. We identified and qualified manufacturers to provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient and fill-and-finish services for our initial product candidate prior to our submission of an NDA to the FDA and expect to continue utilizing this approach for any future product candidates.
 
Securing the manufacture of Flynpovi for further clinical studies and for commercialization in North America, if the product is approved, is the responsibility of One-Two, who was granted a non-exclusive license to manufacture for North America.
 
    22 

  

Material Agreements
 
The Standard Exclusive License Agreement (“License Agreement”) dated December 22, 2011, between us and UFRF grants us an exclusive license to the proprietary technology covered by issued United States Patents Nos. US 5,962,533, which expired in February 2016, and US 6,160,022 which expired in July 2020 and Know-How as defined by the License Agreement, with reservations by UFRF for academic or government uses. Under this agreement, we had agreed to pay various royalties, expenses and milestone payments to UFRF. The License Agreement was amended in December 2016 (“First Amendment”) and again in October 2019 (“Second Amendment”). Under the Second Amendment all minimum royalty payments and milestone payments defined in the License Agreement were eliminated. In addition, the period for payment of royalties was changed to be the shorter of (i) ten (10) years from first commercial sale or (ii) the period of market exclusivity on a country-by-country basis. UFRF may also terminate this license for standard and similar causes such as material breach of the agreement, bankruptcy, failure to pay royalties and other customary conditions. The agreement allows for UFRF to terminate if the first commercial sale is not made by December 31, 2025.
 
CPP is party to a license agreement with One-Two dated July 16, 2021. Under the agreement, One-Two has licensed CPP’s North American development and commercialization rights for Flynpovi. The agreement also calls for CPP to receive a milestone payment upon regulatory approval of Flynpovi by the FDA and royalties on net sales of Flynpovi in the licensed territories. Payment of the milestone payment and net sales royalties shall be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by amounts funded by One-Two for One-Two’s direct employee, clinical and regulatory costs associated with any development activities necessary to secure FDA approval. The Company is not responsible for any costs, as they are incurred, associated with the development and regulatory approval of Flynpovi in North America.
 
Government Regulation 
 
FDA Approval Process 
 
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
 
Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
 
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including the Investigator’s Brochure, information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, potential perceived side effects and risks, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice (“GCP”), an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 
    23 

  

The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board (“IRB”) for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
 
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase I, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects/patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase II usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase II evaluations, pivotal, or Phase III trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In many cases the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase III clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase III trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome, and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible. After an NDA is approved, a Phase IV trial may be undertaken to evaluate safety over a long period of time, quality of life or cost effectiveness.
 
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, toxicology, manufacture, controls and any proposed labeling. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial, and the fees are typically increased annually.
 
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs to encourage timeliness. Most applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within twelve months from submission; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed within eight months from submission. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. If priority review is achieved, the FDA’s goal is to act on the application within six months. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an outside advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”), a quality system regulating manufacturing, is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.

An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
 
Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval 
 
The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are (1) intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or (2) condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request that the FDA designate the product candidate for a specific indication as a Fast Track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the product candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for Fast Track Designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
 
Under the Fast Track program and the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
 
In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase IV or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to priority review by the FDA.
 
If a submission is granted Fast Track Designation, the sponsor may engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, and the FDA may review sections of the NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Additionally, Fast Track Designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 
    25 

  

Breakthrough Therapy Designation 
 
The FDA is also required to expedite the development and review of the application for approval of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the Breakthrough Therapy program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request that the FDA designate the product candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for Breakthrough Therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 
The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of products intended to treat rare diseases or conditions. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, the FDA will grant orphan designation for that product for the orphan disease indication, assuming that the same drug has not already been approved for the indication for which the sponsor is seeking orphan designation. If the same drug has already been approved for the indication for which the sponsor is seeking orphan designation, the sponsor must present a plausible hypothesis of clinical superiority in order to obtain orphan designation. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the FDA discloses the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use.
 
Orphan designation may provide manufacturers with benefits such as research grants, tax credits, Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) application fee waivers and eligibility for orphan drug exclusivity. If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval of the active moiety for that disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which for seven years prohibits the FDA from approving another product with the same active ingredient for the same indication, except in limited circumstances. Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. Further, the FDA may approve more than one product for the same orphan indication or disease as long as the products contain different active ingredients. Moreover, competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan drug has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan drug has exclusivity.
 
In the European Union, orphan drug designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following drug or biological product approval. This period may be reduced to 6 years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
 
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 
Post-Approval Requirements 
 
Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
 
    26 

  

Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase IV testing, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the Agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
 
Additional Regulations and Environmental Matters 
 
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, and our activities may implicate the privacy provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) and similar state laws, each as amended.
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. While we reasonably believe our practices to be in compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute, our practices may not in all cases meet all the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor.
 
Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (as further discussed below).
 
The Civil Monetary Penalties statute authorizes the imposition of severe financial penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 
The federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.

HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services.
 
Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 
We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians, other specified health care professionals and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians, other specified health care professionals and teaching hospitals and report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other specified health care professionals and their immediate family members. Some states have analogous laws requiring manufacturers to report certain transfers of value to covered individuals and entities. To distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.

Coverage and Reimbursement 
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, privately managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. This is also true of Medicare reimbursement, where different vendors process payments, so that coverage by one vendor does not assure that all other vendors will provide coverage. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. In addition, the United States federal government position on matters related to drug pricing is evolving and uncertain, and any changes could have a material impact on drug pricing generally in the United States, including for our product candidates if approved.
 
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom also requires consideration of cost-benefit analysis. The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 
The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on healthcare pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
