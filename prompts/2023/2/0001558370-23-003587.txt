Item 1. BUSINESS
General
Dawson Geophysical Company, a Texas corporation (the “Company”), is a leading provider of North American onshore seismic data acquisition services with operations throughout the continental United States (“U.S.”) and Canada. We acquire and process 2-D, 3-D and multi-component seismic data for our clients, ranging from major oil and gas companies to independent oil and gas operators as well as providers of multi-client data libraries. Our principal business office is located at 508 West Wall, Suite 800, Midland, Texas 79701 (Telephone: 432-684-3000), and our internet address is www.dawson3d.com. We make available free of charge on our website our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K as soon as reasonably practicable after filing or furnishing such information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
Except as otherwise specifically noted herein, references herein to the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” refer to Dawson Geophysical Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.
We provide our seismic data acquisition services primarily to providers of multi-client data libraries for use in the onshore drilling and production of oil and natural gas in the continental U.S. and Canada, as well as directly to onshore oil and natural gas exploration and development companies. The main factors influencing demand for seismic data acquisition services in our industry are the level of drilling and completion activity by oil and natural gas companies and the size of such companies’ exploration and development budgets, which, in turn, depend largely on current and anticipated future crude oil and natural gas prices and production levels and depletion rates of the companies’ oil and natural gas reserves.
Our seismic data acquisition crews supply seismic data primarily to companies engaged in the exploration and development of oil and natural gas on land and in land-to-water transition areas. In recent years, we have provided seismic acquisition services for carbon capture and sequestration projects. Seismic acquisition services of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Eagle Canada Seismic Services ULC (“Eagle Canada”), are also used by the potash mining industry in Canada, and Eagle Canada has particular expertise through its heliportable capabilities. Our clients rely on seismic data to identify areas where subsurface conditions are favorable for the accumulation of existing hydrocarbons, to optimize the development and production of hydrocarbon reservoirs, to better delineate existing oil and natural gas fields, and to augment reservoir management techniques. In addition, seismic data are sometimes utilized in unconventional reservoirs to identify geo-hazards (such as subsurface faults) for drilling purposes, aid in geo-steering of a horizontal well bore and rock property identification for high grading of well locations and hydraulic fracturing. The majority of our current activity is in areas of unconventional reservoirs.
We acquire geophysical data using the latest in 3-D seismic survey techniques. We introduce acoustic energy into the ground by using vibration equipment or dynamite detonation, depending on the surface terrain, area of operation, and subsurface requirements. The reflected energy, or echoes, are received through geophones, converted into a digital signal at a single or multi-channel recording unit, and then transmitted to a central recording vehicle. Subsurface requirements dictate the number of channels necessary to perform our services. We generally use tens of thousands of recording channels in our 3-D seismic surveys with the largest project consisting in excess of 60,000 recording channels and dozens of energy source units. We are capable of deploying multiple crews equipped with this technology on multiple projects simultaneously. Additional recording channels enhance the resolution of the seismic survey through increased imaging analysis and provide improved operational efficiencies for our clients. With our state-of-the-art seismic equipment, including computer technology and multiple channels, we acquire, on an efficient basis, immense volumes of seismic data that, when processed and interpreted, produce precise images of the earth’s subsurface. Our clients then use our seismic data to generate 3-D geologic models that help reduce drilling risks, finding and development costs, and improve recovery rates from existing fields.
In addition to conventional 2-D and 3-D seismic surveys, we provide what the industry refers to as multi-component seismic data surveys. Multi-component surveys involve the recording of alternative seismic waves known as shear waves. Shear waves can be recorded as wave conversion of conventional energy sources (3-C converted waves) or from horizontal vibrator energy source units (shear wave vibrators). Multi-component data are utilized in further analysis of subsurface rock type, fabric and reservoir characterization. We own equipment required for onshore

multi-component surveys. The majority of the projects in Canada require multi-component recording equipment. We have operated one to two multi-component equipped crews in the U.S. periodically over the past few years. The use of multi-component seismic data could increase in North America over the next few years if industry conditions improve and potentially require capital expenditures for additional equipment.
In recent years, we have provided surface recorded microseismic services utilizing equipment we own. Microseismic monitoring is used by clients who use hydraulic fracturing to extract hydrocarbon deposits to monitor their hydraulic fracturing operations. 
We market and supplement our services in the continental U.S. from our headquarters in Midland, Texas and from additional offices in two other cities in Texas (Houston and Plano) as well as one additional state, Oklahoma (Oklahoma City). In addition, we market and supplement our services in Canada from our facilities in Calgary, Alberta.
The Industry
Technological advances in seismic equipment and computing allow the seismic industry to acquire and process, on an efficient basis, immense volumes of seismic data which produce precise images of the earth’s subsurface. The latest accepted method of seismic data acquisition, processing, and the subsequent interpretation of the processed data is the 3-D seismic method. Geophysicists use computer workstations to interpret 3-D data volumes, identify subsurface anomalies, and generate a geologic model of subsurface features. In contrast with the 3-D method, the 2-D method involves the collection of seismic data in a linear fashion, thus generating a single plane of subsurface seismic data. Over recent years, the size of our surveys and density of recording channels and vibrator energy source units has increased, resulting in an increase in required recording channels and energy source units to perform such surveys. The trend for our industry has been a shift to fewer, larger channel count crews operating with an increase in the number of energy source units. We do operate smaller crews from time to time depending on the requirements of the specific project.
3-D seismic data are used in the exploration and development of new reserves and enable oil and natural gas companies to better delineate existing fields and to augment their reservoir management techniques. Benefits of incorporating high resolution 3-D seismic surveys into exploration and development programs include reducing drilling risk, decreasing oil and natural gas finding costs, and increasing the efficiencies of reservoir location, delineation, and management. In order to meet the requirements necessary to fully realize the benefits of 3-D seismic data, there is an increasing demand for improved data quality with greater subsurface resolution with increased density of recording channels and vibrator energy source units.
Currently, the North American seismic data acquisition industry includes a number of primary competitors which includes us, SAExploration Holdings, Inc. (“SAE”), Echo Seismic Ltd. (“ECHO”), Breckenridge Geophysical, LLC. (“Breckenridge”), and Paragon Geophysical Services, Inc. (“Paragon”), along with other smaller companies which generally run one or two small channel count seismic crews and often specialize in specific regions or types of operations.
Equipment and Crews
In recent years, we have experienced continued increases in recording channel capacity and vibrator energy source units on a per crew or project basis. This increase in channel count and energy source unit demand is driven by client needs and is necessary in order to produce higher resolution images, increase crew efficiencies and undertake larger scale projects. Due to the increase in demand for higher channel counts, we continued in recent years to make investments in additional channels. In response to project-based channel requirements, we routinely deploy a variable number of channels on a variable number of crews in an effort to maximize asset utilization and meet client needs. While the number of recording systems we own may exceed the number utilized in the field at any given time, we maintain the excess equipment to provide additional operational flexibility and to allow us to quickly deploy additional recording channels and energy source units as needed to respond to client demand and desire for improved data quality with greater subsurface images. We believe we will realize the benefit of increased channel counts and flexibility of deployment through increased crew efficiencies, higher revenues and margins with improved conditions.
In recent years, we have purchased or leased a significant number of cableless recording channels. We utilize this equipment primarily as stand-alone recording systems. As a result of the introduction of cableless recording systems, we have realized increased crew efficiencies and increased channels on projects using this equipment. We believe we will experience continued demand for cableless recording systems and increased channel count in the future.

As of December 31, 2022, we operate 112 vibrator energy source units and approximately 285,000 recording channels. The recording channels consist of 111,000 single-channel GSR/GSX boxes, 150,000 channels of GSR Multi-channel boxes and a 24,000 channel INOVA Hawk System. Each crew consists of approximately 40 to 100 technicians with associated vehicles, geophones, a seismic recording system, energy sources, cables, and a variety of other equipment. The GSR/GSX and INOVA Hawk crews utilize a recorder to manage the data acquisition while the individual system captures and holds the data until they are placed in the Data Transfer Module. The data is then transferred to various data storage media, which are delivered to a data processing center selected by the client.
Equipment Acquisition and Capital Expenditures
We monitor and evaluate advances in geophysical technology and commit capital funds to purchase the equipment we deem most effective to maintain our competitive position. Purchasing and updating seismic equipment and technology involves a commitment to capital spending. We also tie our capital expenditures closely to demand for our services. Beginning in 2014, we adopted a maintenance capital expenditures program due to the belief that our equipment base was sufficient to meet current demand; however, our Board of Directors may increase the capital budget in response to strategic opportunities to acquire seismic recording equipment. Our Board of Directors approved a maintenance capital expenditure budget of $5,000,000 for 2022 of which we utilized $1,778,000 during the 12 months ended December 31, 2022. Our Board of Directors has approved an initial maintenance capital expenditure budget of $5,000,000 for 2023. 
Clients
Our services are marketed by supervisory and executive personnel who contact clients to determine geophysical needs and respond to client inquiries regarding the availability of crews or processing schedules. These contacts are based principally upon professional relationships developed over a number of years.
Our clients range from major oil and gas companies to small independent oil and gas operators and also providers of multi-client data libraries. The services we provide to our clients vary according to the size and needs of each client. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, sales to three clients represented approximately 35% of our revenues. We anticipate that sales to these clients will represent a similar percentage of our overall revenues during 2023. The remaining balance of our revenues were derived from varied clients and none represented 10% or more of our revenues. 
We historically have not acquired seismic data for our own account or for future sale, maintained multi-client seismic data libraries, or participated in oil and gas ventures; however Wilks Brothers, LLC, our controlling shareholder, has participated in those activities in the past, and may choose to do so with us in the future. The results of seismic surveys conducted for a client belong to that client. It is also our policy that none of our officers, directors or employees actively participate in oil and natural gas ventures. All of our clients’ information is maintained in the strictest confidence.
Domestic and Foreign Operations
We derive our revenue from domestic and foreign sources. 
Refer to “Note 15, Areas of Operation” to the Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated by reference herein for additional details.
Contracts
Our contracts are obtained either through competitive bidding or as a result of client negotiations. Our services are conducted under general service agreements for seismic data acquisition services which define certain obligations for us and for our clients. A supplemental agreement setting forth the terms of a specific project, which may be canceled by either party on short notice, is entered into for every project. We currently operate under supplemental agreements that are either “turnkey” agreements providing for a fixed fee to be paid to us for each unit of data acquired or “term” agreements providing for a fixed hourly, daily, or monthly fee during the term of the project or projects.
Currently, as in recent years, most of our projects are operated under turnkey agreements. Turnkey agreements generally provide us more profit potential, but involve more risks because of the potential of crew downtime or operational delays. We attempt to negotiate on a project-by-project basis some level of weather downtime protection within the turnkey 

5




agreements. Under the term agreements, we forego an increased profit potential in exchange for a more consistent revenue stream with improved protection from crew downtime or operational delays.
Competition
The acquisition of seismic data for the oil and natural gas industry is a competitive business. Contracts for such services generally are awarded on the basis of price quotations, crew experience, and the availability of crews to perform in a timely manner, although factors other than price, such as crew safety, performance history, and technological and operational expertise, are often determinative. Our primary competition includes SAE, ECHO, Breckenridge, and Paragon. In addition to these previously named companies, we also compete for projects from time to time with smaller seismic companies which operate in local markets with only one or two small channel count crews. Further, the barriers to entry in the seismic industry are substantial but not prohibitive. The recent increase in channel count and number of energy source units required for larger projects makes it more costly and timely for new seismic companies or those outside of the U.S. to enter the domestic market and compete with us.
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 226 full-time employees, of which 47 consisted of management, sales, and administrative personnel with the remainder being crew and crew support personnel. Our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe we have good relations with our employees.
