 Item 1. Business
 Our Mission
Our mission is to deliver the most important and complex payments. In an increasingly digital world, getting paid means Flywire.
Our Company
Flywire is a leading global payments enablement and software company. Our next-gen payments platform, proprietary global payment network and vertical-specific software help our clients get paid and help their customers pay with ease—no matter where they are in the world. Our clients rely on us for integrated solutions that are both global and local, and combine tailored invoicing, flexible payment options, and highly personalized omni-channel experiences. We believe we make generational advances for our clients by transforming payments into a source of value and growth for their organizations while delighting their customers with payment experiences that are engaging, secure, fast, and transparent.
There have been substantial strides made in payments technology in the retail and e-commerce industries; however, massive sectors of our global economy—including education, healthcare, travel, and business to business (B2B) payments—are still in the early stages of digital transformation. We estimate the annual addressable volume for these sectors alone to be approximately $11.7 trillion, as more fully described in “Our Market Opportunity”. We believe Flywire is well-positioned to capture a meaningful share of this global payment volume given our ability to provide deeply-integrated digital solutions that address both domestic and cross-border payments.
Our clients, and the types of organizations we serve in education, healthcare, travel, and B2B, require payment processes and experiences that can deliver high-stakes, high-value payments and are specifically tailored to their industry, their business, and their customers. Often, payment solutions have a “one size fits all” approach, without regard for the particular nuances and detailed operations of specific verticals. Without Flywire, organizations often invest substantial resources in building their own payment offerings or rely on disparate legacy systems, which not only fail to meet their or their customers’ needs but also divert meaningful resources away from revenue-generating work. When core payment capabilities like invoicing, diverse payment offerings and reconciliation are inefficient, organizations miss the opportunity to use payments to scale and grow their business.
Flywire was founded to solve these challenges. We aim to power the transformation of our clients’ accounts receivable functions by automating paper and check-based business processes in addition to creating interactive, digital payment experiences for their customers. As a result, clients who implement our cross-border and in-country domestic payments and software solutions can experience improved accounts receivable, higher enrollment in payment plans, and a reduction in customer support inquiries. We help our clients turn their accounts receivable functions into strategic, value-enhancing areas of their organizations.
Over the last decade, we have invested significant resources to build a global network of bank, payment and technology partners that enable us to provide end-to-end connectivity between our clients and their customers in many countries around the world. We have engineered our software-driven payments technology stack to meet enterprise-level standards and functionality while delivering simplicity, convenience and ease of use for our clients and their customers. In addition, we have developed personalized communication channels (e.g., short message service (sms), chat, email, text, or phone) to enhance our clients’ ability to engage with their customers through a digital-first user experience. The result of these investments is our Flywire Advantage.
Our Flywire Advantage is derived from three core elements: (i) our next-gen payments platform; (ii) our proprietary global payment network; and (iii) our vertical-specific software backed by our deep industry expertise.


    
•Next-Gen Payments Platform. Our platform improves the legacy accounts receivable value chain by facilitating global payment flows across multiple currencies, payment types, and payment options. We do not simply collect payments and track money flows. Rather, our clients integrate our platform into their existing apps and workflows once and have access to a full suite of solutions, including tailored invoicing, settlement and reconciliation tools, single sign-on and checkout, recurring payments, and split payouts. Our platform automates and manages the process from initial invoice delivery through payment settlement and core system reconciliation. In addition, we leverage deep data and analytics to help our clients understand their customers’ historic payment behavior, facilitate transaction matching to optimize costs and offer flexible domestic and international payment plans. 
 •Proprietary Global Payment Network. At the core of our business is our network of global, regional and local banking partners which we have been strategically expanding for over a decade. With a single connection to Flywire, our clients have access to a unique set of payment methods including banks, third-party payment providers, payment networks and digital wallets—making it possible to accept and settle payments in over 240 countries and territories and in over 140 currencies. Our global payment network also provides direct connections to alternative payment methods such as Alipay, Boleto, PayPal / Venmo, and Trustly. Regardless of the currency on the invoice received, our clients’ customers can pay in their local currency with their preferred payment method. Additionally, our global payment network is optimized for country-specific regulatory and compliance standards which often require vertical-specific functionality and processes to serve our clients and their customers. 
 •Vertical-Specific Software Backed by Deep Industry Expertise. We go beyond payments by offering seamless integration of our software within our clients’ existing operating workflows and IT infrastructure. Our team, with decades of industry and domain expertise, designed our cloud-based software to be highly scalable across the types of clients we serve, aiming to solve unique payments and accounts receivable challenges of education, healthcare, travel, and B2B. For example, we have launched over 8,000 client payment portals, each built on our shared payments platform and global payment network but tailored to our clients’ brands and needs. In addition, our software solutions include interactive dashboards to manage payments, reporting tools to streamline reconciliation and customer communication tools to personalize and digitize engagement. This 


enables us to be a hub of omni-channel connectivity, augmenting the relationship between our clients and their customers.
These three core elements of our business fuel a powerful and accelerating flywheel. When we started Flywire, we built a robust payments platform that solved pain points for cross-border payments and delivered simplicity, transparency, and cost-effective solutions. Continued adoption of our payments platform has enabled us to enhance engagement with our clients, create more personalized connections for our clients’ customers and extend our reach. Adding new clients and their customers builds our global scale and deepens our knowledge and expertise, enabling us to streamline and automate complex accounts receivable functions. As shown in the illustration below, as the number of clients using our next-gen payments platform grows, we are able to continue to enhance our end-to-end solutions, tailor our vertical-specific software and expand our global payment network to support more local payment types.



The benefits of our flywheel are visible in the significant scale we have achieved to date. As of December 31, 2022, we serve over 3,100 clients around the world. In education, we serve more than 2,300 institutions. In healthcare, we serve more than 80 healthcare systems, including four of the top 10 healthcare systems in the United States ranked by hospital size. In our newer payment verticals of travel and B2B, we have a growing portfolio of more than 600 clients.
Our business model is designed to encourage rapid, widespread utilization of our solutions. We enable our clients to scale the use of Flywire to an unlimited number of customers with favorable unit economics. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we enabled approximately $18.1 billion and $13.2 billion, respectively, of total payment volume across more than 140 currencies.
 The value of our Flywire Advantage has been recognized, with global financial institutions and technology providers choosing to form channel partnerships with us. Our channel partners include financial institutions such as Bank of America Corporation; payment providers such as China UnionPay Co. Ltd. and Adyen N.V.; and software companies that serve as the core systems in our verticals such as Ellucian Company, L.P. in education and Cerner Corporation in

healthcare. These partnerships promote organic referral and lead generation opportunities and enhance our indirect sales strategy.
We also reach clients through our direct channel. Our domain-experienced sales and relationship management teams bring vertical expertise and regional and local reach that drives high dollar-based net retention. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our annual net dollar-based retention rate was approximately 124%. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our annual net dollar-based retention rate was approximately 140%. For the year ended December 31, 2020, despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our clients and the industries we serve, our annual net dollar-based retention rate was approximately 100%. In addition, our client and customer service combines high-tech and high-touch functions backed by 24x7 multilingual customer support, resulting in high client and customer satisfaction. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had a net promoter score (NPS) of 62, which exceeds the average NPS of traditional financial institutions.
 We have grown rapidly since our founding. We generated revenue of $289.4 million, $201.1 million and $131.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and incurred net losses of $39.3 million, $28.1 million and $11.1 million, respectively for those same years. In July 2022, we acquired Cohort Solutions Pty Ltd. (Cohort Go), an Australian-based education payments provider that simplifies the student recruitment process by bringing together students, agents and essential student services such as health insurance into one platform. In December 2021, we acquired WPM Group Ltd. (WPM), a leading software provider that enables seamless and secure payment experiences for universities and colleges across the U.K. In February 2020, we acquired Simplificare Inc. (Simplee), a provider of healthcare payment and collections software.
 Benefits of the Flywire Advantage to Our Clients and Their Customers
Flywire sits in between our clients, which include educational institutions, hospitals, travel providers, businesses, and their customers: students, patients, travelers, and businesses. We believe this two-sided relationship makes us strategically important for our clients–who rely on us for their complex accounts receivable needs, and for our clients’ customers–who rely on us to deliver their most important payments.
Benefits of the Flywire Advantage to Our Clients
We continuously apply our knowledge and domain expertise in education, healthcare, travel, and B2B payments to expand upon our solutions and meet the specific needs of our clients, while freeing them from cumbersome and legacy financial processes. For our clients, key benefits of our solutions include:
•Modern customer-focused payment experience. We enable a convenient and secure online payment experience which can be configured by country, currency, client, and vertical. Our personalization engine leverages our data and applies artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to match the payment preferences of our clients’ customers with the right payment options. By streamlining a previously cumbersome and highly-manual process, our clients have the ability to extend transparency to their customers and proactively engage them through their preferred communication methods. 
 •Simplify payments complexity. We address complexity in payments by providing our clients with a “one-stop shop” offering, substantially reducing the need to work with and manage multiple disparate vendors and systems. Our clients can experience a seamless workflow from start to finish with end-to-end visibility, from invoice to payment to receipt and reconciliation. This helps accelerate funds flow while streamlining operational expenses. 
 •Processing cost savings and enhanced payments yield. We leverage our significant global volume and in-house currency hedging algorithms to mitigate our clients’ risk from currency fluctuation and reduce incremental payment fees, which we believe results in significant cost savings to our clients’ bottom line. Additionally, to optimize affordability for our clients’ customers, we design personalized payment plan offers. By providing a better customer experience, our clients can eliminate time-consuming customer calls and make their operations more efficient. We believe this results in our clients getting paid more quickly and consistently. 
 •Ease of integration. Built on open architecture, Flywire integrates with existing systems and technology, allowing clients to consolidate transactions and accounts, automate payment plans and cash management, and optimize processing through aligned billing-related tools. This ease of integration enables our clients to serve their customers better and faster, increasing satisfaction while reducing costs. 


•Trusted expertise and a trusted brand. Our clients and their customers view Flywire as a trusted technology partner. With deep roots in each industry we serve, our thought leadership, guidance, and innovation in our solutions, have built confidence and advocacy in Flywire throughout our clients and their customers around the world. We believe we bring a new level of transparency, efficiency, and value to industries that are traditionally characterized by complex operations and held back by services of legacy providers. Additionally, we believe the strength of our information security and compliance that underpins our solutions is a core differentiator that drives client trust. 
 Benefits of the Flywire Advantage to Our Clients’ Customers
Our digital-first customer experience is designed to make the process of paying invoices simple. For our clients’ customers, key benefits of our solutions include:
•Superior and simple payment experiences. Our customer value proposition is simple: we provide a fast and nearly frictionless experience for our clients’ customers’ most important payments. Providing an integrated experience that leverages single sign-on, our clients’ customers can very quickly view real-time account balance updates, receive personalized communication and complete their payments – all as part of a streamlined digital self-service experience. These features can lead to an increase in self-service digital payments and optimized conversion of completed payments. 
 •Customer preference. Using Flywire, our clients’ customers can choose their preferred payment method, currency, and communication channel, such as sms, chat, email, text, or phone. We make it possible to accept and settle payments in over 240 countries and territories and in more than 140 currencies, so our clients’ customers can choose the way they pay using local payment methods that they are most comfortable using. 
 •Flexible on-demand payment options. We believe we provide favorable and transparent payment plans that can lead to increased engagement and enrollment by our clients’ customers. As a result, our clients’ customers can spread expenses across smaller, easier-to-manage payments. Our payments platform also enables our clients to offer their customers the choice to either front-load payment plans or provide extension options beyond service delivery. 
 •Customer confidence. Navigating the world of complex cross-border payments can be overwhelming for our clients’ customers. With our superior customer experience including around the clock multilingual support, we believe that we give customers the confidence that their payments are delivered securely, accurately, and on time. 
 How Our Flywire Advantage Works
Our clients’ needs extend beyond simple payment processing. Enabling our clients to use enhanced payment functionality to drive business value as well as streamlining and automating their domestic and cross-border payment operations, requires a specialized approach that combines a secure, reliable, and robust suite of payments and software solutions with a seamless customer experience.
To achieve this, we leverage our Flywire Advantage and its three core elements: (i) our next-gen payments platform; (ii) our proprietary global payment network; and (iii) our vertical-specific software backed by our deep industry expertise.
Next-Gen Payments Platform
Our next-gen payments platform is designed for payment processes and experiences that can deliver high-stakes, high-value payments. Through a single connection to our platform, we support the entire lifecycle of a domestic or cross-border transaction across online, mobile or in-person channels. This eliminates the need to work with multiple vendors and payment providers.
For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we enabled approximately $18.1 billion and $13.2 billion, respectively, in total payment volume across multiple payment types, including local bank transfer, credit, debit and other alternative payment methods such as Alipay, Boleto, PayPal / Venmo, and Trustly. The majority of our payment volume is not card related and is completed over our global payment network. This reflects the myriad of payment options enabled by our global payment network that are critical for the larger, more complex payments that we handle.

We designed our next-gen payments platform to be:
•Integrated. Fully unified and seamlessly connected to a broad range of core operating systems, facilitating easy data capture and compatibility across a broad range of solutions; 
 •Flexible. Supports complex workflows and payment experiences for both in-country domestic and cross-border payments; and 
 •Secure. Leverages Payment Card Industry-validated Point-to-Point Encryption tokenization and other best-in-class and regulatory-compliant security measures. 
 By utilizing predictive analytics, ML and AI, we handle the complexities of money movement across borders while providing fast, compliant, and transparent receipt of payments. Our AI and ML enabled fraud detection risk engine has trained against millions of automated clearing house (ACH), check, card, and wire transactions. As a result, the enhanced power of our risk engine enables us to mitigate fraud.
Our comprehensive payments offering enables our clients to provide their customers a choice of cost-effective payment methods, currencies, and terms while enjoying a seamless digital experience. Our offering, supported by Flywire’s security, risk, and compliance monitoring tools, includes:
•enhanced invoicing, settlement and reconciliation tools that simplify billing and customer payments and better manage cash flow and revenue; 
 •end-to-end processing, from authorization to clearing to settlement and reconciliation; 
 • turnkey solution for enhanced and secure single sign-on and checkout; 
 •recurring, split and flexible payment options, including robust payment plan logic that can be tailored in our vertical-specific implementations; and 
 •unified reporting and analytics tools through direct integrations to client back-end infrastructure. 
 Below is a sample funds flow for a traveler from Australia taking a ski vacation in Japan paying in their local currency and with their preferred method of payment, such as a bank transfer of Australian Dollars to Japanese Yen, without incurring hidden fees, and with exchange rate protection. The illustration shows how our next-gen payments platform can be configured and activated at the client level, and deliver a seamless experience from any country of payment or receipt.



In addition to international expansion, we are accelerating the growth of our in-country domestic accounts receivable business, both by selling new solutions to existing clients and gaining new clients. Many of our clients who successfully use our payments platform to process cross-border payments require a similar solution for in-country domestic payments, which have similar challenges: they are reliant on home-grown or legacy solutions with limited or inflexible capabilities and often require time consuming manual updates. With our payments platform, clients are able to streamline payment processes and offer their customers flexible payment options, without the expense of building their own systems—for both in-country domestic and cross-border transactions.
Proprietary Global Payment Network
Our proprietary global payment network is comprised of global, regional and local banks and technology and payment partners around the world. We believe the extensive global reach and breadth of our network, serving more than 240 countries and territories, provides a strong competitive advantage. Additionally, we have local market knowledge and expertise to enable funds flow in some of the hardest to reach markets. We have also assembled redundant payment rails, wherever possible.
With Flywire’s network, our clients can take advantage of our “local-in / local-out strategy”—providing access to pay-in options, such as local bank transfers, card-based payments, and alternative payment methods, while enabling pay-out capabilities in our clients’ preferred local payment methods.
We believe our receive-side network sets us apart. Flywire clients, no matter the vertical or market they are in, can receive a single daily payment in their preferred currency that aggregates and reconciles all their customer payments made via Flywire from around the globe—across approximately 4,000 geographic corridors for 2022 representing transaction flows between payers and payees.
 Once our clients are connected to our global payment network, they can leverage an extended range of services and capabilities, including:
•Transaction routing optimized for cost, risk and compliance management. We leverage the “plug and play” configuration of our global payment network and our proprietary payment-routing engine to analyze costs, currency exchange rates and payment acceptance data. Based on our analytics, we can configure optimal transaction routing that increases authorization rates in a secure and compliant manner, while reducing our processing costs and the costs to our clients’ customers. 
 •Local clearing capabilities. Our clients’ customers have the ability to authorize and clear transactions in over 240 countries and territories through our connectivity to banks and major payment networks. Payments are made through direct connections to global, regional and local banks or through relationships with our payments partners including Citigroup Inc. These connections and relationships help us create local clearing hubs which enable our clients and their customers to have a local payments experience. 
 •Ecosystem of alternative payment methods. We offer a myriad of alternative payment methods, such as Alipay, Boleto, PayPal / Venmo, and Trustly, to allow customers to choose how they pay. We believe this helps promote greater adoption of our payments platform, higher levels of engagement and satisfaction, and increased value across our ecosystem. 
 •Global pay-out. We enable our clients to automate disbursements and seamlessly settle in over 140 currencies via pay-out options including local currency bank deposits. We believe we are able to settle pay-out more quickly given our end-to-end control and visibility of the transaction process. 
 •Tailored and scalable regulatory and compliance infrastructure. This foundational element underpins our global payment network. We have fraud and transaction monitoring tools designed to accommodate multiple industry verticals. We combine this with the application of know-your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) standards that are tailored to meet the applicable requirements of the jurisdictions where our clients operate. In addition, we leverage our in-depth knowledge of the markets in which we operate to execute tactically while complying with local licensing and regulatory requirements. 


Vertical-Specific Software Backed by Deep Industry Expertise
We tailor our software to meet the needs of each vertical market we serve. We do so by leveraging our industry expertise and knowledge to develop a comprehensive view of our clients’ complex business challenges. We learn to “speak our clients’ language” and tailor their invoicing processes and payment options to their specific situations.
We offer deep integration within our clients’ existing apps and workflows for seamless payment acceptance and reconciliation. Our integrations, supported by our application programming interfaces (APIs), include some of the largest and most recognized accounting and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, such as Ellucian Company, L.P. in education, Epic Systems Corporation in healthcare, Rezdy Pty Ltd in travel, and Oracle Corporation in B2B payments. Through these integrations, our clients are able to reduce the number of banks and technology and payment providers on which they rely, while achieving faster settlements and lower wire and transaction fees.
Specific features of our vertical-specific software include:
•Vertical-specific digital workflows. We help our clients automate the accounts receivable process from creation of an invoice to delivery to the customer, to receipt of funds and synchronization back to their ERP system. In these workflows, we provide enhanced capabilities that improve customer satisfaction and may increase the collectability of amounts owed (e.g., offering patients of a health system the option to create a payment plan if they are unwilling or unable to pay their full amount due in a single payment). We provide timely status updates of financial inflows and outflows by indicating when invoices are delivered, opened, and paid. Our robust reporting tools provide our clients with a real time overview of their business’ payments profile. 
 •Integration and synchronization to core and industry specific systems. Our software is designed to automate accounts receivable reconciliation by synchronizing customer transactions with our client’s accounting and ERP systems. Our synchronization capabilities substantially reduce double data-entry and increase efficiency. 
 •Real-time access. By leveraging our data, our clients can access real-time invoice and payment status updates, facilitate seamless communication with customers and easily track payments from their customers. 
 •Predictive analytics. We have robust predictive analytics capabilities to assess payment transactions across our client base and to intelligently determine the appropriate pricing or payment plans. For example, in healthcare, we have built a personalization engine that enables hospitals and healthcare systems to better predict a patient’s capacity to pay and tailor the payment options they are offered, all in accordance with the hospital’s business rules. 
  Below is an illustration of how a large hospital client utilizes our software to personalize patient engagement with payment options and billing conversations. We solve capacity to pay for our clients’ customers (with payment plans or other intelligent promotional financing) and we engage with them through their preferred communication methods (e.g., sms, chat, email, text, or phone). In turn, our clients are able to maximize yield on their accounts receivable potential, resulting in higher net payments, lower call volume, lower debt outstanding and most importantly, lower costs and happier patients.


Our Industry
We believe Flywire plays a critical role in helping digitize transactions in traditionally underserved markets, facilitating in-country domestic and cross-border invoicing and payments, automating reconciliation, and providing a seamless experience for our clients’ customers. Our ability to deliver the most important and complex payments both domestically and internationally has become increasingly valued by our clients due to the following trends:
Globalization—and the rise of a “borderless” economy—requires global, cross-border and local payment and regulatory expertise
As the world becomes more connected, it is both easier and harder to do business. Consumers want to make payments across borders with ease and want to have a personalized experience in their language and in their local currency. Businesses are attempting to satisfy this demand, but we believe they often struggle to deliver truly global capabilities. Providing a solution that meets the needs of our global client base extends beyond simple payment processing. Enabling, streamlining, and automating our clients’ in-country domestic and cross-border payment operations requires a specialized approach that combines a secure, reliable, and robust suite of payments and software solutions with a seamless customer experience. We believe we can deliver extensive global reach and bring local market knowledge and expertise to keep up with the rapidly changing payments landscape.
Globalization has also increased the complexity of the regulatory landscape that our clients need to navigate. Consumers and businesses are required to understand and adhere to extensive and often incongruous sets of laws and regulations in both local and cross-border regimes. For example, many countries with significant cross-border flows require distinct paperwork to be collected, validated and recorded as part of currency export compliance for high-value payments. Furthermore, we believe that clients often lack the policies, procedures and systems in order to implement and monitor strict compliance. We believe that the result is often costly and manual review processes, which can also increase the client’s risk of penalties and fines. We endeavor to actively manage the global complexities of regulation for our clients’ payments while implementing innovative solutions intended to make the entire process more efficient and user-friendly.
The shift to software-integrated digital payments is accelerating
As business and consumer transaction expectations shift with digitization, providers of modern payments platforms with industry-specific software have begun to displace legacy systems. Businesses and consumers have come to expect that all payment flows, especially for high-value services, are settled with the same ease as typical e-commerce purchases. We expect these trends will impact all industries and force many businesses to accept new digital payment methods. We believe fully integrated payments and software solutions, including those provided by us, enable businesses

to offer seamless payment experiences, minimize friction at the point-of-sale and respond to evolving customer preferences.
Legacy payment and accounts receivable management infrastructure has significant limitations and is ripe for innovation
Even in some of the largest industries in the world, such as education, healthcare, and travel, legacy payment and accounts receivable infrastructure has not evolved to streamline complexities nor enhance efficiency as demanded by organizations or their customers. This legacy infrastructure has the following limitations:
•Paper-based. The accounts receivable process, from creation of an invoice to delivery to the customer, is most often still dependent on paper. This paper-based workflow not only results in payment flows that are slow, error-prone, and less secure, but is also costly for businesses. Organizations that process substantially all of their accounts receivable by automated or electronic means report half the accounts receivable processing costs of those that do not, according to survey data from the American Productivity and Quality Center (APQC). We digitize and automate the accounts receivable process from start to finish, allowing clients to rely on our solutions and save on their accounts receivable transaction and processing costs. 
 •Manual. Legacy workflows require manual input of employees at every stage of the accounts receivable process: from opening an envelope, logging the receipt, getting approvals, cashing the check, to proper accounting and compliance. This repetitive employee engagement significantly slows down payment flows, increases likelihood of error, and is more expensive for businesses. Organizations that automatically generate the vast majority of their invoices reported processing almost twice as many invoices per invoicing full-time equivalent (FTE) compared to those that do not, according to survey data from the APQC. Our clients can easily leverage our solutions for traditional back-office tasks, with less manual labor involved from start to finish. 
 •Disparate. Many businesses deal with multiple accounting and reconciliation systems to process a single transaction flow. According to APQC survey data, inefficient processing of receivables requires almost 2.5 times as many FTE resources compared to top-performing organizations for the same dollar volume. Instead of relying on stacks of disparate technology systems that were not built to work together in the context of a seamless experience, our clients can use our solutions to automatically synchronize customer transactions while leveraging their existing IT infrastructure. 
 •Lacking functionality and capabilities that drive value. A large number of businesses attempt to use their current accounting or ERP systems for accounts receivable management. These systems often lack functional and analytical capabilities to calibrate and present optimal payment options that could improve customer experience and maximize client yield on their accounts receivable. In contrast, our predictive analytics capabilities provide valuable insights to help drive business decisions and allow our clients to tailor their offerings. For example, our clients can see when a payment plan may be helpful to one of their customers, allowing them or their customers to initiate a payment plan. This insight and functionality can ultimately increase the speed and frequency of collection and improve customer satisfaction. 
 Accelerating digitization of B2B payments
We believe the B2B payments market remains one of the largest untapped opportunities in the payments industry. Few payments and software companies have end-to-end integrated payments solutions including accounts receivable software, omni-channel offerings, cross-border capabilities and other value-added services. Most often, providers only offer one or two of these capabilities and require clients to employ other piecemeal point solutions. The unique combination of our next-gen payments platform, proprietary global payment network, and vertical-specific software enables us to design and deliver a comprehensive suite of solutions that help our business clients get paid by their customers.
 Our Market Opportunity
We believe the trend of digitizing payments is inevitable across all industries. When businesses and consumers make payments, they expect a quick and easy process. On the receiving end, businesses expect to accept payments from different sources and countries, and reconcile them from within one system, but without added complexity or additional costs.

Many industries still lack the digital payments infrastructure that is necessary to meet customer demand and solve operational inefficiencies. For example, the majority of healthcare payments are still made by check. Likewise, in education, budget shortfalls, along with rising tuition costs, have added financial strain and created collections problems.
These inefficiencies are costly. According to a study by Deloitte, middle-market businesses incur $3.3 trillion in operational costs when reconciling invoices as a result of inadequate legacy solutions, such as disparate file formats and lack of back-office support for automated remittances.
Despite these shortfalls, the demand for domestic and cross-border money movement continues to accelerate and global payments present one of the largest market opportunities. For the primary industries we currently serve, we estimate the current addressable market for our solutions to be approximately $1.7 trillion in global payment volume, including education ($660 billion)(1), healthcare ($500 billion)(2) and travel (approximately $530 billion).(3)
Additionally, our B2B payments offering expands the addressable market for our solutions, which we estimate to be over $10 trillion in addressable B2B payment volume(4). Given Flywire’s existing penetration of key verticals, ability to integrate with a broad range of core systems and continued investments in our next-gen payments platform, proprietary global payment network, and vertical-specific software, we believe we have the opportunity to capture a meaningful share of this payment volume.

(1)Based on net household payments to educational institutions in OECD countries in 2020 according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and payments made to private education institutions in Southeast Asia in 2015 according to EY Parthenon. 
 (2)Based on U.S. out of pocket healthcare spending in 2019 according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and cross-border healthcare payments in 2020 according to Patients Without Borders. 
 (3)Based on global travel industry revenue in 2020 according to IBISWorld and management’s estimates that approximately 41% of the non-business and professional travel payment volume is addressable by our solutions. 
 (4)Based on cross-border B2B inflows revenue in 2020 according to Juniper and management’s estimates that at least 75% of total B2B payment volume is made by medium to large businesses and is potentially addressable by our solutions. 
 Our Growth Strategy
We believe we have a significant opportunity to build on our success and momentum to date. The key elements of our growth strategy include:
Expand Our Client Reach
•Grow with existing clients. We intend to continue to become a more integral part of our clients’ businesses as the number of our clients’ customers who utilize our solutions increases. Our track record of organic growth with our clients is demonstrated by our three-year average annual net dollar-based retention rate, which was approximately 121% for the years ended December 31, 2020 through December 31, 2022. As our clients transform and digitize their operational workflows, we plan to encourage them to add additional solutions, such as tailored invoicing, payment plans, and eStore marketplace. 
 •Continue to win new clients. We plan to expand our sales and marketing efforts to increase brand awareness and highlight the value of our solutions. We believe this will attract new clients to Flywire and as we add more clients, we can accelerate the effects of our flywheel. 
 •Increase payments platform monetization. We have the opportunity to offer additional complementary payment services to our clients’ customers in support of our clients’ business goals. We intend to leverage our Flywire Advantage by expanding the number of use cases we can address such as handling payables in education, business invoices in hospitals, and commissions in travel. 
 •Expand our solution portfolio. We expect to continue investing in our solution portfolio by expanding the breadth and depth of our payments and software capabilities.
 Expand Our Ecosystem Through Channel Partnerships
While the majority of our clients to date have been acquired by our direct sales team, we expect that continued engagement with channel partners, including financial institutions and providers of enterprise software solutions in our key verticals, will enhance our client acquisition efforts and drive continued growth. We also believe our channel partners, which include consultants specialized in our industry verticals, will help amplify the reach and visibility of our solutions to clients worldwide.
Expand to New Verticals and Geographies
We leverage our Flywire Advantage to scale into new verticals and geographic markets. We have a strong track record of expanding efficiently into new verticals and geographic markets, as we have shown in healthcare, travel, and B2B payments and in the expanded reach of our global payment network. We see a large and significantly underserved opportunity for clients domestically and internationally to benefit from our payments platform, global payment network and vertical-specific software. Additionally, there are other industries, including real estate and government taxes, that we believe are poorly digitized and could benefit from our solutions.
Pursue Strategic and Value-Enhancing Acquisitions
We intend to continue to complement and accelerate our organic growth strategies through acquisitions. We have a successful record of identifying, executing, and integrating acquisitions, and we intend to continue to pursue acquisitions through a highly disciplined approach. We also have the scale to be an attractive and reputable consolidator in the payments markets as evidenced by our ability to retain nearly all of the clients and employees from our Simplee, WPM and Cohort Go acquisitions. We believe our approach and breadth of experience in integrating culturally-aligned businesses position us to maximize the value we derive from future acquisitions.
Our Flywire Culture and Team
As an organization, our culture is founded on our shared experiences, unique and diverse backgrounds, and belief in our mission to deliver on the most important and complex payments. As a collective team of approximately 1,000 full-time employees and contractors, who Flywire calls FlyMates, we strive for excellence as one team, guided by our core values, including:
•Global collaboration. We believe in teamwork. 
 •Authenticity. We never compromise on integrity, honesty, and kindness. 
 •Fulfillment. We strive for personal and professional satisfaction. 
 •Execution. We accomplish our goals through collective support and accountability. 
 •Ambitious innovation. We continuously look to deliver more and new value to all our constituents. 
 •Evolved learning. We believe in new challenges and constant growth. 
 Our leadership team defines our culture and strategy and collectively has decades of experience leading companies through rapid growth at scale. Representing approximately 40 nationalities and spoken languages, our diverse team of FlyMates deliver critical domain expertise and regionally tailored skill sets to our clients 24x7. We believe our team’s relentless client focus and adherence to our shared values are evident in our 2022 NPS of 62, and will continue to define our future success.
Our Business Model
We derive revenue from transactions and platform and usage-based fees. Each new student tuition bill, patient visit, travel journey and business invoice, is an opportunity for us to generate fees.
Our revenue is highly re-occurring in nature due to the mission-critical nature of our solutions that are deeply integrated within our clients’ existing operating workflows and IT infrastructure. We believe the depth and breadth of our solutions help our clients get paid faster and with less friction. This enables us to develop long-standing relationships with our clients, which in turn also drive strong retention and significant cross-selling opportunities.
An Illustration of Our Solution
We simplify domestic and cross-border payment transactions for our clients by eliminating the need to work with disparate vendors for invoicing, global pay-in and pay-out, compliance and risk management and more. Through a single connection to Flywire, we enable our clients to securely accept and reconcile payments and engage with their customers. The illustrations below depict how Flywire manages both international and domestic payments for a representative education client.

International Payment Example: In the first example below, a Chinese student paying their tuition to a Canadian university experiences a seamless process from start to finish—choosing their preferred payment method and currency. For our client, the accounts receivable process is automated and streamlined from invoice to receipt and to reconciliation and real-time ERP updates. For our cross-border payments, we have short term foreign exchange exposure, typically between one and four days; we leverage our in-house currency hedging algorithms, and enter into non-deliverable forward foreign currency contracts, to mitigate the volatility related to fluctuations in the foreign exchange rates. For additional discussion about our foreign exchange exposure, please see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”.

Domestic Payment Example: The example below illustrates the process of offering payment plans to domestic students, which can be set up by either the school or the student.



From the same payments platform, we manage the entire payment process for our clients with the only difference being the type of payment offering selected to meet the needs of their customers, whether that be international or domestic.
Our Go-To-Market Strategy
Our direct sales channel is core to our go-to-market strategy. We believe that regional, vertical, and broader domain expertise, as well as continued client management, are critical to our sales success. Our regional sales teams are located in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific region including Singapore, Japan, and Australia. Our relationship management team augments direct sales capabilities by cultivating existing relationships and identifying cross-sell and up-sell opportunities of additional solutions, contributing to our strong dollar-based net retention rate. We believe that our ability to understand the nuanced pain points of education, healthcare, and travel accounts receivable is a strategic advantage enabling us to gain clients in those verticals, while our broader domain expertise in payments, treasury, and banking is critical to executing on our broader B2B payments expansion.
We focus our sales and marketing efforts on generating leads to develop our sales pipeline, building brand and vertical awareness, scaling our network of partners, and growing our business from our existing client base. Our sales leads primarily come through inbound digital channels including our website, content marketing efforts, lead generation and account-based marketing tactics, virtual events, and industry trade shows and associations.
We typically follow a “land-and-expand” strategy as our clients engage with us on more than one solution as we grow our partnership. For example, in education we have a high success rate expanding beyond solving cross-border payments needs, with clients also adopting our domestic solutions or full-suite enterprise solution. Once our clients experience the depth of our ability to handle their multi-faceted accounts receivable and payments needs, our relationship managers are able to successfully cross-sell and up-sell other solutions, creating a large avenue of revenue generation with minimal incremental acquisition cost.
We also reach clients indirectly through our channel partnerships, integrations with workflow software, and other technology providers. Our channel partners include financial institutions, such as Bank of America Corporation, as well as a number of referral partners such as Tribal Group and Cerner Corporation. Additionally, Flywire has integrations with leading accounting and ERP systems, such as Oracle Corporation, Ellucian Company, L.P., Epic Systems Corporation and Rezdy Pty Ltd.
Our Technology and Architecture
Our unified technology is at the core of our Flywire Advantage. The scale and complexity of the product implementation challenges that we address for our clients and their customers cannot easily be addressed through today’s legacy systems and outdated infrastructure. Instead, it requires our combination of a modern technology stack, cloud-native infrastructure, and investment in product and engineering management talent.
Our engineering approach includes a DevOps culture, microservice architecture, continuous delivery, and the use of containers to enable shorter development lifecycles. We also operate independently-deployable services that are critical to supporting verticals and reliability across operating environments. Our product and engineering leadership team has a long history of payments and payments technology experience, with domain expertise across our verticals.

Our technology stack is comprised of the following:

Payments-as-a-Service
Our next-gen payments platform includes the infrastructure required to support more than just simple money flows:
•Payment services. Our technology to capture the payment from our clients’ customers. 
 •Enabling services. Our proprietary pricing engine, foreign currency exchange hedging infrastructure, and ML technology to manage fraud and AML risk. 
 •Transaction processing services. Our routing capabilities enabled by our automated technology to deliver on-time payments to the appropriate destination. 
 Software-as-a-Service
Our vertical-specific software leverages our payments platform to provide industry specific solutions and deliver “last mile” connectivity to our clients’ operating systems and their customers. Our applications address complex billing and domestic and cross-border payment processes, while delivering a near seamless payment experience. Additionally, our personalization engine, delivered as a software solution and leverages our AI and ML and deep analytics systems.
Public Application Programming Interface (API)
 We recently launched a direct public API that sits on top of our payments platform. For organizations of all sizes, from smaller businesses to larger enterprises who want to control the customer experience, we can expose our API for easy integration, significantly reducing the time to realize advantages from the use of our solution. This public API capability significantly enhances our ability to scale and to execute on our growth strategies.
Our technology is designed for speed, resilience and reliability. We believe we demonstrated our ability to scale when we entered the broader B2B market and were able to leverage engineering solutions and APIs in our other verticals, including a native module integrated into NetSuite. Our technology enables us to process transactions in real-time, regardless of origin, destination or amount. For example, in education, our deep, customized integrations within our clients’ systems can lead to the difference between on-time enrollment or missed registrations—a difference that cannot be delivered through batch processes that are not posted instantaneously. We leverage Amazon Web Services (AWS) for

our cloud redundancy, and tools such as Site24x7, Pingdom, Cloudflare, and PagerDuty for an uninterrupted experience for our clients.
Our Compliance and Risk Management Foundation
We have a dedicated compliance and risk management function. We have implemented the practices to help us protect our business and assure our clients and payment partners that our processes are compliant and meet or exceed their exacting standards, including advanced and agile practices for risk governance and a monitoring program that leverages key data inputs and software. We have robust AML, suspicious activity reports (SARs) and client KYC procedures. We also devote considerable resources to our data and cyber security. In addition, we possess key certifications across the verticals we serve, which we believe is an important aspect of why our clients choose to work with us. These audit-tested certifications and risk program features, which in many cases apply with specificity to the verticals we serve, include: third party certifications for Service Organization Control 2 (both SOC 1, Type II and SOC 2, Type II), Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance, as well as systems and processes designed to ensure compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, the Data Security Law and Personal Information Protection Law in China, the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA), the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act in Canada, Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), among others.
Our experienced team, coupled with our advanced technology and software tools, helps us navigate the challenges of global payments in a compliant manner:
•Local and global regulatory regimes. We believe we are able to react nimbly to global and local regulatory changes that affect our business. 
 Locally, we often work with licensed and regulated payment service providers (PSPs) to bring more familiar solutions to our clients’ customers and to leverage their regulatory insight. This insight can be a valuable tool to deliver differentiated services to our clients to help them stay in front of laws that may impact their business. For example, in India, we addressed new tax withholding requirements for our clients’ customers and deployed a solution to help with their education-related payments.
•Currency controls and exemptions. We have developed robust controls to comply with the requirements of handling cross-border payments. For example, in certain jurisdictions where it is required, we are able to help track and prove purpose-driven payments through digital document collection and verification integrated with our clients’ systems. 
 •Transaction-level risks. Our payments platform subjects payments to a series of controls, to mitigate the risk of facilitating fraud, money laundering, or transactions subject to sanctions. Payment information, historical activity and user behavior are utilized to identify potentially fraudulent transactions. All payments are monitored for suspicious behavior consistent with money laundering or terrorist financing, and all alerted activity is investigated by our internal team of experienced analysts. We also screen sender and receiver information, along with geolocation data, against relevant international watch lists. 
 •Dedicated, experienced and globally dispersed risk, information/physical security and internal audit function. We have consistently maintained a dedicated risk and security team – led by our Chief Information Security Officer – that is global in nature and devises and supports Flywire’s strategy of risk reduction and business process and information protection excellence by assuring confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic information. We have also developed an internal audit program utilizing internal and external auditors focused on policies and processes, testing our controls, and reporting on a regular basis to our Audit Committee. Among the focal points are the risk and security program areas:
 orisk mitigation through outreach, awareness, assessment, policy development and adoption of best practices;
 obuilding and maintaining secure access protocols and network architecture;
 omonitoring of networks and systems to protect against, detect and eradicate malicious activity and ensure regulatory compliance;
 omanaging continuity of operations planning for critical information systems;


oresponding to security breaches to contain incidents and improve protocols;
 oregulatory “horizon scanning” and managing and enforcing compliance with global regulations (Sarbanes-Oxley, FERPA, HIPAA, GDPR, ADA and others);
 omanaging physical security, health and safety (office, business travel and FlyMates);
 odeveloping and enforcing our vendor due diligence program; and
 oresponding to external audits and law enforcement enquiries, conducting internal investigations, and maintaining audit-tested risk and security certifications. 
 To support these areas of focus, our risk and security team has developed a foundation resting on an appropriate governance and policy structure, robust and scalable security architecture and solutions, and an expansive and continuous cyber security and incident response framework. In addition, we have FlyMates in the compliance and risk management function located around the world where we have operations to address the needs of the business in real-time.
Competition
Our primary competition consists of legacy payment methods such as traditional bank wires provided by local, regional and global banks and money transfers from remittance companies. Other competitors include integrated payment providers focused on cross-border payments; B2B payments platforms; and vertical-specific software solutions offered by local niche players.
We believe many legacy payment providers are hindered by limitations such as antiquated technology systems, insufficient solution and service offerings, poor user experiences, and unsatisfactory client and customer support. Our modern technology stack, combined with our innovative and flexible suite of solutions, addresses many of the issues that clients face today, including:
•friction in client and customer experiences; 
 •lack of a scaled global network; 
 •limited software and payments offerings; 
 •inability to adapt to new technology; and 
 •unsophisticated fraud prevention and risk management tools. 
 We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of these factors.
Intellectual Property
We protect our intellectual property through a combination of trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights both domestically and abroad. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection. We endeavor to enter into agreements with our FlyMates, consultants and contractors and with parties with whom we do business in order to acquire intellectual property rights developed as a result of service to Flywire, as well as to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information.
We actively pursue registration of our trademarks, logos, service marks, trade dress, and domain names in the United States and in other jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2022, we had 106 registered trademarks and trademark applications, and were the registered holder of a variety of U.S. and international domain names.
From time to time, we also incorporate certain intellectual property licensed from third parties. Even if any such third-party technology was not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, we believe that alternative technologies would be available as needed.
For additional information about our intellectual property and associated risks, see the section titled “Risk Factors–If we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights, our competitive position could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets, generate less revenue and incur costly litigation to protect our rights.”
 Regulation and Industry Standards
Various aspects of our business and service areas operate in a quickly evolving regulatory environment, and are subject to U.S. federal, state, and local regulation, as well as regulation outside the United States. Certain of our services also are subject to rules promulgated by various card networks and other authorities, as more fully described below. These descriptions are not exhaustive, and these laws, regulations and rules frequently change, are subject to differing interpretations or enforcement, and are increasing in number.
We are registered as a Money Service Business (MSB) with the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and its implementing regulations, collectively, the BSA, and certain obligations contained therein, including, among other things, certain record-keeping and reporting requirements, and examinations by FinCEN.
The BSA is the primary compendium of U.S. laws and regulations regarding AML and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT). As required under the BSA, we have implemented and continue to expand an AML and CFT program designed to prevent our payments platform from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes. Our program is also designed to prevent our payments platform and global payment network from being used to facilitate business with certain individuals, entities, countries, and territories that are subject to economic or trade sanctions that the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls (OFAC) and various foreign authorities administer or enforce. Our AML and CFT compliance programs include policies, procedures, and controls that are designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and to assist in detecting and preventing the use of our payments platform to engage in money laundering or terrorist financing activity. Program elements include, without limitation, the designation of a BSA/AML Officer to oversee the programs, KYC procedures, processes to detect and report suspicious activity, sanctions screening, employee training, annual third-party independent testing, and risk-based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence.
If our compliance programs are found to be deficient, we could lose key relationships with banks, merchant acquirers, and other payment partners on which we rely to carry out our business. Fines, penalties or sanctions for the violation of AML and CFT laws and regulations may be severe and our efforts to remediate issues may be costly, may result in diversion of management and staff time and effort, and may still not guarantee compliance.
Most states in the United States require a license to offer money transmission services. We are in the process of procuring money transmitter licenses (or the statutory equivalent) in those U.S. jurisdictions that require them in order to be able to offer additional business lines in the future. We have procured and maintain money transmitter licenses in 41 U.S. jurisdictions, and actively work to comply with new license requirements as they arise. We have taken the position that Flywire’s business to date is exempt from licensure under various state money transmission laws, either expressly as a payment processor or agent of the payee, or pursuant to common law as an agent of the payee. We actively work to evaluate, and if applicable, comply with new license or regulatory requirements as they arise. Although we believe we have defensible arguments in support of our positions under the state money transmission statutes, we have not expressly obtained confirmation of such positions from all of the state banking departments who administer the state money transmission statutes. It is possible that certain state banking departments may determine that our activities are not exempt from licensure. In the past, certain competitors have been found to violate laws and regulations related to money transmission, and they have been subject to fines and other penalties by regulatory authorities. Regulators and third-party auditors have also identified gaps in how similar businesses have implemented AML and CFT programs. The adoption of new money transmitter or MSB statutes, or changes in regulators’ interpretation of existing state and federal money transmitter or MSB statutes or regulations, could subject Flywire to new registration, licensing or other requirements. Any determination that Flywire is in fact required to be licensed under such state money transmission or MSB statutes may require substantial expenditures of time and money and could lead to liability in the nature of penalties or fines, as well as cause us to be required to cease operations in some of the U.S. jurisdictions we serve.
With respect to the money transmission licenses we maintain in U.S. jurisdictions, we are subjected to, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting requirements, bonding requirements, limitations on the investment of customer funds, and examination by state regulatory agencies. Any actual or perceived failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements related to our money transmitter licenses may result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, regulatory or governmental investigations, administrative enforcement actions, civil and criminal liability, and constraints on our ability to continue to operate.
Similar regulatory requirements exist in other markets where we do business. For example, local Flywire entities are licensed as Authorised Payments Institutions in each of the United Kingdom (U.K.) (regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)) and Lithuania (regulated by the Bank of Lithuania (BOL)), and Australia (regulated by the Australian

Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC)). In addition, we have secured in-principle approval for a Major Payment Institution license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). When serving clients in these regulated markets, we are generally required to implement governance structures, AML and CFT programs and KYC standards that are different from those in the U.S., and which incorporate local or European Economic Area (EEA) requirements. The FCA in particular has been an active regulator, and as a result of Brexit, we were able to both obtain a license from the BOL and continue to serve our EEA clients through the “passporting” principle without any interruption of service. In other non-U.S. markets, we are able to serve clients in locations that either do not require Flywire to obtain a license or pursuant to a specific exemption issued by the applicable regulator.
In addition, several jurisdictions where our clients’ customers reside impose currency export controls (e.g., China and India), taxation at source or other documentation requirements before money can be converted into destination currency and sent abroad. Generally, our local payment partners in these locations will assist in ensuring the customers meet these requirements, but it is often the case that we need to ensure that the Flywire payment experience accommodates the unique and ever-changing regulatory environments where our clients’ customers are located.
There are also a number of U.S. federal and state consumer finance and consumer protection laws that may impact Flywire’s business. States have a myriad of statutes and case law precedent addressing when credit card surcharges or convenience fees may be imposed by third-party service providers and under what circumstances they are prohibited. In addition, Dodd-Frank created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has assumed responsibility for implementing and enforcing most federal consumer financial protection laws and a prohibition on unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices. Several of these laws apply to some of Flywire’s clients, and in some cases, Flywire is contractually obligated to ensure its services do not violate these laws, even though Flywire is not directly subject to them. For example, the Truth in Lending Act of 1968 (TILA) is a U.S. federal law that applies to creditors and is designed to promote the informed use of consumer credit. Although Flywire is not in the business of extending credit or charging interest on the payments it helps its clients collect, when Flywire clients extend credit subject to TILA, TILA may require our clients to provide disclosures to their customers about consumer credit terms and costs in a format specified by the CFPB. Our payment installment plan functionality utilized by our clients in healthcare and education often requires that our payment experience accommodate these disclosure obligations that attach to our clients. Our business may also be subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) which regulates the use and reporting of consumer credit information and imposes disclosure requirements on entities that take adverse action based on information obtained from credit reporting agencies. We could be liable if our practices governed under the FCRA are not in compliance with the FCRA or its regulations.
The Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) also imposes substantive disclosure and error resolution obligations on entities that facilitate electronic fund transfers and international remittance transfers. We could be liable for violating EFTA if we fail to comply with these requirements when they apply to us. We do not believe other laws that are implemented by the CFPB, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act apply to us. If these determinations are wrong, interpretations of these statutes change, or we expand or change our solutions, we may be subject to the restrictions imposed by these laws. Should our business or solutions change in a way that did subject us to the CFPB’s jurisdiction, we would be subject to increased scrutiny of our business and consumer compliance practices.
Separately, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA) and similar state and federal laws contain extensive rules relating to communication by telephone, such as detailed requirements relating to granting and revocation of consent and “opt-in” or “opt-out” thresholds for receipt of communications, and these requirements are often changing and the subject of high-profile litigation. Our services include features regulated by the TCPA and similar laws (e.g., calls made from automated dialing systems, texts confirming receipt of payment, status updates or due dates, appointment reminders) and we can be liable for penalties, or subject to litigation or contractual indemnification obligations, if we do not comply with them.
Flywire is also required to navigate card network rules and other requirements of self-regulatory organizations, such as ACH payment networks. We rely on our varied network of merchant acquirer relationships to access the payment card networks such as Visa and Mastercard, which enable our acceptance of credit cards and debit cards. We pay fees to our merchant acquirers for such services.
Visa, Mastercard and other card networks set complex and evolving rules and standards with which we must comply—often referred to as “card network rules”. We also have relationships with American Express, Japan Credit Bureau (JCB) and China Unionpay, which impose similar obligations on us. The payment networks and their member financial institutions routinely update, generally expand and modify requirements applicable to merchant acquirers and their customers, including rules regulating data integrity, third-party relationships, merchant chargeback standards and

compliance with the PCI DSS. PCI DSS is a set of requirements designed to ensure that all companies that process, store, or transmit payment card information maintain a secure environment to protect cardholder data. Under certain circumstances, we are required to report incidents to the card networks and other authorities within a specified time frame. Any changes in card network rules or standards that increase the cost of doing business or limit our ability to provide processing services to our merchants will adversely affect the operation of our business.
If we or our merchant acquirers fail to comply with the card network rules or other applicable rules and requirements of the card payment networks, Visa or Mastercard or our other card providers could suspend or terminate our registration. Further, our transaction processing capabilities, including with respect to settlement processes, could be delayed or otherwise disrupted, and recurring non-compliance could result in the payment networks seeking to fine us, or suspend or terminate our registrations which allow us to process transactions on their networks, which would make it impossible for us to conduct our business on its current scale.
Under certain circumstances specified in the card network rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments, or other assessments of our compliance with the PCI DSS. Such activities may reveal that we have failed to comply with the PCI DSS. In addition, even if we comply with the PCI DSS, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach or other cybersecurity incident.
The termination of our registration with the payment networks, or any changes in payment network or issuer rules that limit our ability to provide card payment alternatives to our clients’ customers could have an adverse effect on our payment processing volumes, revenues and operating costs. If we are unable to comply with the requirements applicable to our settlement activities, the payment networks may no longer allow us to provide these services and we would lose a substantial portion of our revenues.
We are also subject to the National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) operating rules. NACHA is a self-regulatory organization which administers and facilitates private-sector operating rules for ACH payments and defines the roles and responsibilities of financial institutions and other ACH network participants. The NACHA Rules and Operating Guidelines impose obligations on us and our partner financial institutions particularly when we instruct our partner institutions to debit a third party’s account. These obligations include audit and oversight by the financial institutions and the imposition of mandatory corrective action, including termination, for serious violations. If an audit or self-assessment of PCI DSS or NACHA compliance identifies any deficiencies that we need to remediate, the remediation efforts may distract our management team and other staff and be expensive and time consuming.
Similarly, our ACH sponsor banks have the right to audit our compliance with NACHA’s rules and guidelines and are given wide discretion to approve certain aspects of our business practices. Like the payment networks, NACHA may update its operating rules and guidelines at any time, which could require us to take more costly compliance measures or to develop more complex monitoring systems. The NACHA rules permit transactions to be returned under certain circumstances. If too many of our transactions are returned, our ability to access the ACH system could be impaired by our partner financial institutions. Our partner financial institutions could similarly change their interpretation of NACHA requirements, which could require costly remediation efforts and could prevent us from continuing to provide services through such partner financial institutions until we remediate issues to their satisfaction.
We collect and use a wide variety of information (including personal information) for various purposes in our business, including: (i) to help ensure the integrity of our services, (ii) to meet KYC, transaction monitoring, AML and CFT standards, and (iii) to provide features and functionality to our clients and their customers. This aspect of our business, including the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of personal information we acquire in connection with the use of our services, is subject to numerous laws and regulations in the United States and globally. Regulation and proposed regulation in this area has increased significantly in recent years and is expected to continue to do so.
In addition to numerous privacy and data protection laws already in place, U.S. states are increasingly adopting laws modeled on the GDPR that impose comprehensive privacy and data protection obligations. For example, the CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020, gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used, and it imposes other requirements as well. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches. Colorado, Virginia and Utah have recently joined California in enacting privacy and data protection legislation that impose additional obligations on businesses related to the collection, storage and utilization of third party information, as well as the reporting of data breaches. All 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands (similar to many of the other countries where we do business), have passed laws regulating the actions that a business must take if it experiences a data breach, such as prompt disclosure to affected individuals, consumer reporting agencies, or governmental agencies. In addition, we are subject to laws in the U.S. and

abroad restricting or placing conditions on our ability to collect and utilize certain specific types of information, such as Social Security and driver’s license numbers.
Many of the foreign jurisdictions where we or our customers do business, including the European Union (E.U.), have laws and regulations dealing with the processing of personal information, which in some cases are more restrictive than those in the United States. In addition to regulating the processing of personal information within the relevant jurisdictions, these legal requirements often also apply to the processing of personal information outside these jurisdictions, where there is some specified link to the relevant jurisdiction. For example, Flywire has multiple offices in Europe and serves clients and their customers throughout the E.U., where GDPR went into effect in 2018. The GDPR, which also is the law in Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein, and—to a large degree—the U.K., has an extensive global reach and imposes robust obligations relating to the processing of personal information, including documentation requirements, greater control for data subjects (e.g., the “right to be forgotten” and data portability), security requirements, notice requirements, restrictions on sharing personal information, data governance obligations, data breach notification requirements, and restrictions on the export of personal information to most other countries. Fines of up to 20 million Euros or up to 4% of the annual global revenue of a noncompliant corporate family, whichever is greater, could be imposed for violations of certain of the GDPR’s requirements, and private claims also are possible.
Recent legal developments have created compliance uncertainty regarding some transfers of personal information from the U.K. and EEA to locations where we or our customers operate or conduct business, including the United States and potentially Singapore. Under the GDPR, such transfers can take place only if certain conditions apply or if certain data transfer mechanisms are in place. In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the E.U. ruled in its “Schrems II” decision (C-311/18), that the Privacy Shield, a transfer mechanism used by thousands of companies to transfer data between those jurisdictions and the United States (and also used by Flywire), was invalid and could no longer be used due to the strength of United States surveillance laws. In September 2020, the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner of Switzerland (where the law has a similar restriction on the export of personal information) issued an opinion concluding that the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework does not provide an adequate level of protection for data transfers from Switzerland to the United States pursuant to Switzerland’s Federal Act on Data Protection. We and our customers continue to use alternative transfer strategies including the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) while the authorities interpret the Schrems II decision and the validity of alternative data transfer mechanisms. The SCCs, though previously approved by the European Commission, have faced challenges in European courts (including being called into question in the Schrems II decision), and may be further challenged, suspended or invalidated for transfers to some or all countries. For example, guidance regarding Schrems II issued by the European Data Protection Board (which is comprised of representatives from every E.U. member state’s top data protection authority) have cast serious doubt on the validity of SCCs for most transfers of personal information to the United States. The Schrems II decision and related enforcement actions or other legal developments in this area could subject us to negative financial consequences, such as fines, penalties, loss of customers, and the need to engage in costly restructuring of our business and IT operations and restructuring of our relationships with service providers and other partners.
In Asia, there has been an increase in both regulation and enforcement of privacy laws. The Act on Protection of Personal Information originally enacted in June 2020 by the Japanese government, was amended and came into effect on April 1, 2022 (Amended APPI). Since the passage of the Amended APPI, a number of implementing regulations and supporting documents have been released, addressing the requirements for transferring personal data outside Japan, notifying security breaches and creating pseudonymous information exempt from certain obligations under the Amended APPI.
China passed its new Data Security Law (DSL) in June 2021 and its new Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) in August 2021. Both new laws impact every business operating in or doing business with China, coupling extensive obligations with respect to the processing of all types of data, with potentially significant penalties for noncompliance. With the promulgation of the DSL and PIPL, China has tightened up regulation on collection, processing, sharing and cross-border transfer of personal data and important data such as financial data. The new data security regime has an extraterritorial effect and imposes additional compliance obligations with respect to processing (in and outside China) of personal data of Chinese individuals and other data which may be viewed sensitive or important. These regulations apply not only to our client’s payers who are Chinese nationals (such as students seeking to study abroad) but also China-based employees as well as third party business partners.
As a reaction to data security concerns, the Australian parliament recently approved a bill to amend the country's privacy legislation, significantly increasing the maximum penalties for companies and data controllers who suffer large-scale data breaches to the greater of: (i) AU$50 million, (ii) three times the value of any benefit obtained through the

misuse of information, and (iii) 30% of a company's adjusted turnover in the relevant period. Previously, the penalty for severe data exposures was AU$2.22 million, considered by the current parliament to be wholly inadequate to incentivize companies to improve their data security mechanisms. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner will have new regulatory tools and flexibility that should, together with an ongoing focus on funding, see a more proactive regulator with capacity and capability to investigate and litigate more privacy incidents in Australia.
 We have taken steps to address compliance obligations that apply to us under the Amended APPI, the DSL, the PIPL and Australian data security laws but cannot assure you that such steps will be effective, and we may face the risk of increased costs, liability and loss of business.
 There are also regulations that require that access to websites be safe and accessible for people with disabilities. The ADA contains certain standards (most commonly referred to as Section 508 Standards) that apply to federal government websites as well as to websites that may be provided by institutions that are recipients of federal funding. Many of our clients (principally higher education clients in the U.S.) receive support from U.S. federal agencies, and require that our payment experience be accessible and conform to the Section 508 Standards and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 Level AA. Our payment experience is ADA-compliant, and we arrange for third-party audits to ensure that we continually conform to these standards. As we modify our user interface to improve or add features and functionality to our payment experience, we must continue to account for ADA compliance when required.
Human Capital and Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 1,000 full-time FlyMates. We also engage part-time and temporary FlyMates, as well as consultants as needed to support our operations. As an organization, our culture is founded on our shared experiences, unique and diverse backgrounds, and belief in our mission to deliver on the most important and complex payments. Our leadership team defines our culture and strategy and collectively has decades of experience leading companies through rapid growth at scale.
None of our FlyMates are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our FlyMates to be good.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional FlyMates. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected FlyMates, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards.
Our Values
 At Flywire, we commit to encourage and reward behaviors that are consistent with our culture, which is founded on our shared experiences, unique and diverse backgrounds, and belief in our mission to deliver on the most important and complex payments. We seek to hold each other accountable when behaviors do not support the culture we aspire to. Our values include:
 •Global Collaboration. We believe in teamwork and that together we are greater than the sum of individual FlyMates, across experience, location and position. We seek to understand and embrace everyone’s uniqueness, and leverage the power of our FlyMates and clients’ and their customers’ cultural differences and perspectives to create value.
 •Authenticity. We value integrity, honesty, and kindness. We believe in staying true to oneself, being courageous enough to share your voice and humble enough to admit when you are wrong. Above all, we strive for sincerity and encourage both giving and receiving feedback.
 •Fulfillment. We recognize that fulfillment comes from personal and professional satisfaction, from bringing our whole selves to work. It is understanding what ignites our individual passions and gets us excited, while being inclusive and knowing that this is different for everyone. We believe that by engaging with the wider community, giving back and contributing, our greater purpose is fulfilled.
 •Execution. We aim to take calculated, sensible risks and make smart decisions quickly to accomplish our objectives. We are helpful and supportive of each other, yet we hold each other accountable to delivering with a sense of urgency in all that we do.


•Ambitious Innovation. We continuously look for ways to deliver more and new value to our clients and their customers, partners and people. We are leaders not followers, curious and open-minded, and we recognize there is always room for improvement and strive for excellence and welcome new ideas.
 •Evolved Learning. The importance of actively listening, questioning, challenging, and accepting is not lost on us. We are a learning organization, eager to expand as individuals, as teams and as a company. We live by the knowledge that there is no endpoint to learning, that there is always room for growth.
 We define our values by the virtues and behaviors that shape them, as these values guide us in all that we do: in hiring, performance, and day-to-day interactions with both FlyMates and our clients and their customers.
 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Report
 In December 2022, we released our inaugural ESG report, our first comprehensive summary of how we integrate social good initiatives into our business strategy. The report provides baseline metrics as well as a detailed overview of the core tenets of our ESG program, which are shaped by many defining principles - from social impact and community engagement, to diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I), and much more. Our ESG report is based on global best practices, and aligns with metrics set forth by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Boards (SASB) standards as well as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards.
 Our report details the company’s investments across the following ESG disciplines, including:
 •Affordability and accessibility: Flywire’s payments technology and software enables payers to set up payment plans, helping to make high-value transactions like medical bills and education expenses more accessible and affordable.
 •Diversity, equity and inclusion: Flywire employees represent 40 nationalities and more than 35 spoken languages. Our Employee Resource Groups, including Flywire Pride, FlyBlack, Women of Flywire and Flywire Globals, are devoted to promoting our DE&I mission.
 •Career development and training: In 2022, FlyMates spent more than 2,900 hours on company-sponsored career development and training programs. These initiatives are available to all FlyMates, including part-time and contract employees.
 •Social impact and community engagement: A cornerstone of Flywire’s social impact and community engagement efforts is The Flywire Charitable Foundation, which has tripled in size since its inception in 2020.
 •Data privacy, security and compliance: Flywire’s dedicated compliance and risk management function, overseen by our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Information Security Officer with Board-level oversight, has been built over more than a decade, providing payers and clients confidence in our solutions.
 •Governance and ethics: Flywire is committed to ethical and compliant business practices and good corporate governance for the long-term success of our company and stakeholders. We have a Code of Conduct that is actively enforced and mandatory training across a spectrum of important topics, ranging from anti-money laundering to sexual harassment to information security best practices.
 •Environmental sustainability: Flywire conducted our first greenhouse gas emissions audit, over our own operations and our most significant value-chain emissions with a vision to reduce our carbon-intensive activities and improve overall energy efficiencies. Our baseline inventory includes Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions from purchased electricity, purchased goods and services (cloud services only), business travel and employee commuting and telework.
 In the past year, we have reinforced our commitment to ESG by:
 •Codifying ESG as a strategic priority and establishing new management and oversight of ESG priorities. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of Flywire’s Board of Directors is responsible for the oversight of company ESG initiatives, supported by Co-Executive Sponsors and a cross-functional task force of employees that comprise the ESG disclosure committee.
 •Establishing a Center of Expertise for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) to better serve our diverse, global community of FlyMates where they live and work, and to deliver inclusive and compelling experiences that engage and care for FlyMates.


•Enhancing our career development and skills training policies by offering new programs focused on enriching FlyMates’ careers and growing them both personally and professionally. 
 •Maximizing our social impact initiatives both through the third annual scholarship program administered by The Flywire Charitable Foundation, and through purposeful philanthropy to non-profit organizations around the world.
