Item 1. Business
General
3D Systems Corporation (“3D Systems” or the “Company” or “we,” "our" or “us”) markets our products and services through subsidiaries in North America and South America (collectively referred to as “Americas”), Europe and the Middle East (collectively referred to as “EMEA”) and the Asia Pacific and Oceania region (collectively referred to as “APAC”). We provide comprehensive 3D printing and digital manufacturing solutions, including 3D printers for plastics and metals, materials, software, and digital design tools. Our solutions support advanced applications in two key industry verticals: Healthcare Solutions (which includes dental, medical devices, personalized health services and regenerative medicine) and Industrial Solutions (which includes aerospace, defense, transportation and general manufacturing). We have over 35 years of experience and expertise which have proven vital to our development of an ecosystem and end-to-end digital workflow solutions that enable customers to optimize product designs, transform workflows, bring innovative products to market and drive new business models.
Business Strategy
Accelerating Additive Manufacturing Adoption
We partner with customers to enable them to adopt and scale additive manufacturing in their production environments. We believe that our additive manufacturing capabilities can help customers solve a number of design and manufacturing challenges – such as improved lead times, enhanced design freedom, part consolidation and the ability for mass customization. We believe that we have both the scale and the breadth of technologies, encompassing hardware platforms, materials and software, that our customers require for the successful implementation of additive manufacturing into their design and manufacturing processes. Using a strong application focus in each of our two business segments, our Applications Innovation Group integrates our printer hardware, materials, software and professional and technical services in unique combinations to solve a customer’s product need. Once complete, we can scale the process for the customer to a certain production level through our Advanced Manufacturing solutions, and, with increasing demand, we can enable a customer to continue scaling to high volumes within their own production facilities. This transfer of the workflow involves providing the printing systems, materials and software, along with the process definition and other technical expertise, that enables a seamless transfer of capability to the manufacturer. We expect the result of this approach to drive recurring revenue streams as customers adopt additive manufacturing solutions and consume materials to produce parts, utilize software to manage the print process and manufacturing operations, and make use of our service offerings for application development, maintenance and upgrades. Our proficiency in providing industry focused application and solution development for customers includes a number of internal assets and capabilities, including:
a.A full range of additive manufacturing hardware technologies and materials to address needs in metals and plastics (including biocompatible materials for medical use), wax and bioprinting
b.An Application Innovation Group that includes industry and technology application experts, customer innovation and advanced manufacturing centers and post-sale service and support
c.A software suite that enables end-to-end additive manufacturing including design, simulation, process management and manufacturing execution 
d.Scale that includes significant and diverse experience in production parts and applications combined with a global reach to service our customers worldwide
As part of our strategy to enable customers to adopt additive manufacturing in production environments, during 2022 we made a number of targeted investments and entered into partnership arrangements designed to broaden and enhance our product offering of 3D printing solutions and to expand addressable markets for our Industrial Solutions and Healthcare Solutions segments. Among these investments were the acquisitions of Titan Additive LLC (“Titan”), Kumovis GmbH ("Kumovis"), and dp polar GmbH (“dp polar”). Titan is a pellet-based extrusion platform that addresses customer applications requiring large build volumes at a significantly lower cost. Kumovis is an extrusion platform that utilizes medical-grade, high-performance polymers such as PEEK (polyether ether ketone) to print implantable medical devices and surgical instruments with attractive performance qualities. dp polar has designed a 3D printing platform that utilizes a unique rotating build platform to enable true high-speed mass production of customized polymer components. Also during 2022, we signed a joint venture agreement with the Saudi Arabian Industrial Investments company (“Dussur”) with the goal of expanding the use of additive manufacturing within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and surrounding geographies. We also acquired a minority ownership interest in Enhatch Inc. (“Enhatch”) during 2022. As part of this relationship, 3D Systems and Enhatch will incorporate the automation and artificial intelligence capabilities of Enhatch’s Intelligent Surgery Ecosystem into 3D Systems’ proven workflow for patient-specific surgical planning solutions. 
In addition, we believe that developing our software capabilities is an important driver of our future growth. We made significant internal investments during 2022 to further enhance our capability to offer a comprehensive suite of 3D printing software applications. We are working to integrate 3D System’s legacy stand-alone software applications such as Geomagic, 3D Sprint, and 3DXpert into the Oqton Manufacturing Operating System ("MOS") that we acquired in 2021. The goal of this effort is to create a unified cloud-based software solution that will enable users to automate and control their entire digital manufacturing workflow from order to delivery. We are making our new software platform available to the entire additive industry, including both customers and competitors, as a means to accelerate the adoption of additive manufacturing in high-volume production applications across multiple industry segments.
We believe that the above-described acquisitions, partnerships, and software development efforts, as well as other initiatives begun during 2022, will accelerate the adoption of additive manufacturing in our target industrial and healthcare end-markets and open up profitable future growth opportunities for our company. Realizing the full benefit of these growth-oriented initiatives will require us to make additional investments in operations and development activities during 2023 and beyond. 
Investing in Regenerative Medicine
As an early and continuing innovator in additive manufacturing, we have significant experience in bringing this technology to new markets. In 2022, we continued to expand our focus and investments in the application of additive manufacturing for regenerative medicine. Currently, our efforts in the area of regenerative medicine consist mainly of pre-commercial research and development ("R&D") and involve three strategies. 
The first strategy is the use of additive manufacturing for human organ transplantation. Each year, end-stage organ failure kills millions of people. However, the supply of donated organs is insufficient to meet the needs of patients seeking transplantation. During 2022, we made significant progress in our organ printing development program, which we are conducting together with a key strategic partner. This program was first established in 2017 and combines our legacy 3D printing expertise, as well as new capabilities in human tissue engineering from our acquisition of Volumetric Biotechnologies, Inc. ("Volumetric") in 2021, with the regenerative medicine and biotechnology expertise of our partner. To date, our program has focused on developing the capability to print scaffolds for human lungs, with a long-term goal of allowing all patients with end-stage lung disease to receive transplants which will enable them to enjoy long and active lives. Based upon the progress made toward this goal, the program has been expanded to include two additional human organs.
Our second strategy involves utilizing our bio-printing technology to manufacture non-organ human tissue scaffolds for use in transplantation and surgical reconstruction applications. We believe that continued progress in this area could result in significantly improved health outcomes for patients as well as open up attractive new growth markets and therapeutic applications for 3D printed, vascularized soft-tissue scaffolds. During 2022, we pursued this strategy as an internal development program that combines our legacy 3D printing capabilities with bio-printing and materials expertise that we have gained through our Volumetric acquisition, as well as through our work on the human lung program with our development partner.
Our third regenerative medicine strategy seeks to utilize our bio-printing capabilities to design and manufacture 3D-printed vascularized “organs-on-chips” for use in drug development by pharmaceutical industry customers. Currently, drug development is an expensive and time-consuming process, and many drug therapies that appear promising during pre-clinical trials fail during human clinical trials. We believe that “organs-on-chips” can accelerate the drug development process and reduce the cost of pre-clinical drug testing, as well as reduce the pharmaceutical industry’s reliance on animal testing. During 2022, we formed a new wholly-owned biotech company called Systemic Bio in order to accelerate our progress in this area. Systemic Bio will combine 3D Systems’ legacy expertise in high-resolution 3D printing with advanced capabilities in bioprinting and biomaterials gained from our 2021 acquisition of Allevi, Inc. to design and market 3D-printed, vascularized “organs-on-chips” for sale to pharmaceutical industry customers. We plan to provide internal funding to support Systemic Bio during the early stages of its growth, including for activities such as R&D facility expansion, product development and customer acquisition.
