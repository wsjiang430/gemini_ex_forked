ITEM 1. BUSINESS
GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS
Ampco-Pittsburgh Corporation (the “Corporation”) was incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1929. The Corporation, individually or together with its consolidated subsidiaries, is also referred to herein as the “Registrant.” The Corporation manufactures and sells highly engineered, high-performance specialty metal products and customized equipment utilized by industry throughout the world. It operates in two business segments – the Forged and Cast Engineered Products (“FCEP”) segment and the Air and Liquid Processing (“ALP”) segment. This segment presentation is consistent with how the Corporation’s chief operating decision-maker evaluates financial performance and makes resource allocation and strategic decisions about the business.
 While the Corporation operated at normal levels in 2022, it continues to be challenged by lingering global economic effects of a post-pandemic environment and repercussions from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, including:
 •Periodic disruptions to the global supply chain for the Corporation, its vendors and its customers,
 •Global inflationary pressures,
 •European energy crisis, and 
 •Delays in receiving and shipping product due to lack of transportation.
 The Corporation is actively monitoring, and will continue to actively monitor, the geopolitical and economic consequence of these events and the potential impact on its operations, financial condition, liquidity, suppliers, industry, and workforce.
 NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Forged and Cast Engineered Products Segment
The FCEP segment produces forged hardened steel rolls, cast rolls and forged engineered products (“FEP”). Forged hardened steel rolls are used primarily in hot and cold rolling mills by producers of steel, aluminum and other metals. Cast rolls, which are produced in a variety of iron and steel qualities, are used mainly in hot strip mills, medium/heavy section mills, roughing mills, and plate mills. FEP principally are sold to customers in the steel distribution market, oil and gas industry and the aluminum and plastic extrusion industries. The segment has operations in the United States, England, Sweden, Slovenia, and an equity interest in three joint venture companies in China. Collectively, the segment primarily competes with European, Asian and North and South American companies in both domestic and foreign markets and distributes a significant portion of its products through sales offices located throughout the world.
Union Electric Steel Corporation (“UES”) produces forged hardened steel rolls and FEP. It is headquartered in Carnegie, Pennsylvania, with three manufacturing facilities in Pennsylvania and one in Indiana. The following entities are direct or indirect operating subsidiaries of UES:
 Union Electric Steel UK Limited produces cast rolls in a variety of iron and steel qualities for hot strip mills, medium/heavy section mills and plate mills. It is located in Gateshead, England.
 Åkers Sweden AB produces cast rolls in a variety of iron and steel qualities for hot strip mills, medium/heavy section mills, roughing mills, and plate mills. It is located in Åkers Styckebruk, Sweden.

 The segment’s three joint venture companies in China include:

Ltd. and Åkers AB, a non-operating subsidiary of UES, that produces cast rolls for hot strip mills, steckel mills and medium plate mills. It is located in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, China. Åkers AB holds a 59.88% interest in the joint venture.
 Anhui Baochang Roll Co., Ltd., previously known as Magong Gongchang United Rollers Co., Ltd., is a joint venture among UES, Magang (Group) Holding Co., Ltd. and Jiangsu Gong-Chang Roll Co., Ltd. that produces large forged backup rolls for hot and cold strip mills. It is located in Maanshan, Anhui Province, China. Union Electric Steel (Hong Kong) Limited, a non-operating subsidiary of UES, holds a 33% interest in the joint venture.

Jiangsu Gong-Chang Roll Co., Ltd. is a joint venture that produces cast rolls for hot strip mills, medium/heavy section mills and plate mills. It is located in Xinjian Town Yixing City, Jiangsu Province, China. Union Electric Steel UK Limited holds a 24.03% interest in the joint venture.
 Air and Liquid Processing Segment
The ALP segment includes Aerofin, Buffalo Air Handling and Buffalo Pumps, all divisions of Air & Liquid Systems Corporation (“Air & Liquid”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation. The segment has operations in Virginia and New York with headquarters in Carnegie, Pennsylvania. The segment distributes a significant portion of its products through a common independent group of sales offices located throughout the United States and has several major competitors.
 Aerofin Division of Air & Liquid Systems Corporation produces custom-engineered finned tube heat exchange coils and related heat transfer products for a variety of industries including OEM/commercial, nuclear power generation and industrial manufacturing. It is located in Lynchburg, Virginia.
Buffalo Air Handling Division of Air & Liquid Systems Corporation produces large custom-designed air handling systems for institutional (e.g., hospital, university), pharmaceutical and general industrial building markets. It is located in Amherst, Virginia.
Buffalo Pumps Division of Air & Liquid Systems Corporation manufactures centrifugal pumps for the fossil fueled power generation, marine defense and industrial refrigeration industries. It is located in North Tonawanda, New York.
Products
 In both segments, the products are dependent on engineering, principally custom designed, and are sold to sophisticated commercial and industrial users located throughout the world. Products are delivered directly to the customer via third-party carriers or customer-arranged transportation. For the FCEP segment, one customer accounted for 10% of its net sales in 2022, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on the segment, and no customers exceeded 10% of its net sales in 2021. For the ALP segment, no customers exceeded 10% of its net sales in 2022 or 2021. For additional information on the products produced and financial information about each segment, see Note 17, Revenue, and Note 24, Business Segments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Raw Materials
Raw materials used in both segments are generally available from many sources, and neither segment is dependent upon any single supplier for any raw material. Substantial volumes of raw materials used by each segment are subject to significant variations in price. The Corporation’s subsidiaries generally do not purchase or commit for the purchase of a major portion of raw materials significantly in advance of the time they require such materials but periodically make forward commitments for natural gas, electricity and certain commodities (copper and aluminum). See Note 15, Derivative Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Patents and Trademarks
While the Corporation and its subsidiaries hold certain patents, trademarks and licenses, in the opinion of the Corporation, they are not material to either segment.
Backlog
 The backlog of orders at December 31, 2022 was approximately $369.0 million compared to a backlog of $292.6 million at year-end 2021. Both segments contributed to the improvement in backlog. Backlog for the FCEP segment increased by approximately $28.8 million year over year due to the net of improved demand and sale price increases for mill rolls offset by lower FEP backlog and foreign exchange rates used to translate the backlog of the Corporation’s foreign subsidiaries into the U.S. dollar. Backlog for the ALP segment increased by approximately $47.6 million and benefited from improved order intake for each of its product lines. Approximately 6% of the backlog is expected to be released after 2023.
 Competition
The Corporation faces considerable competition from a large number of companies in both segments. The Corporation believes, however, that its subsidiaries are significant participants in each of the niche markets that they serve. Competition in both segments is based on quality, service, price, and delivery.
Environmental Protection Compliance Costs
Expenditures for environmental control matters were not material to either segment in 2022 and are not expected to be material in 2023.

Employees and Human Capital Management
 Employees
 On December 31, 2022, the Corporation and its subsidiaries had 1,565 active employees worldwide (substantially all full-time), of which approximately 54% were employed in the United States. Approximately 34% of the Corporation’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or agreements with works councils.
Oversight
 The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors maintains oversight of the Corporation’s human capital management strategies that it may deem important to the long-term sustainability of the Corporation.
