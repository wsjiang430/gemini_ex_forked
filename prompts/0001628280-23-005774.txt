The following is a description of our business as of December 31, 2022.
OUR SEGMENTS
Wholesale Footwear
Our Wholesale Footwear segment designs, sources, and markets our brands and sells our products to department stores, mass merchants, off-price retailers, shoe chains, online retailers, national chains, specialty retailers, independent stores, and clubs throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Europe, and through our joint ventures and international distributor network. Our Wholesale Footwear business consists of fashion-forward footwear for women, men, and children. Our products are designed and marketed for various lifestyles and include dress shoes, boots, booties, fashion sneakers, sandals, and casual shoes. The Wholesale Footwear segment primarily consists of the following brands: Steve Madden®, Dolce Vita®, Betsey Johnson®, GREATS®, Blondo®, Anne Klein®, Mad Love®, and Superga. This segment also includes our private label footwear business. This segment represented 56.3% of total revenue during 2022.
Wholesale Accessories/Apparel
Our Wholesale Accessories/Apparel segment designs, sources, and markets our brands and sells our products to department stores, mass merchants, off-price retailers, online retailers, specialty retailers, independent stores and clubs throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Europe and through our joint ventures and international distributor network. Our Wholesale Accessories/Apparel business primarily consists of handbags, apparel, small leather goods, belts, soft accessories, fashion scarves, wraps, gifting, and other trend accessories. The Wholesale Accessories/Apparel segment primarily consists of the following brands: Steve Madden®, Anne Klein®, Betsey Johnson®, Cejon®, and Dolce Vita®. This segment also includes our private label handbag and accessories business. This segment represented 18.6% of total revenue during 2022.
Direct-to-Consumer
Our Direct-to-Consumer segment, which was referred to as the Retail segment in previous filings, consists of Steve Madden® and Dolce Vita® full-price retail stores, Steve Madden® outlet stores, and our directly-operated digital e-commerce websites. Our retail stores are located in regional malls and shopping centers, as well as high streets in major cities across the United States, Canada, Mexico, Israel, South Africa, Taiwan, China, and the Middle East. Our stores play an important role in our test-and-react strategy, and also serve as fulfillment and return locations for our e-commerce business. Our stores also serve as a marketing tool that allows us to strengthen global brand recognition and to showcase selected items from our full line of branded and licensed products. In addition to these testing and marketing benefits, we have also been able to leverage sales information gathered at Steve Madden retail stores and our websites to assist our wholesale customers in their order placement and inventory management. We believe that our retail stores and websites enhance overall sales and profitability and our ability to react quickly to changing consumer demands. 
In 2022, we added 28 brick-and-mortar stores and closed 10 brick-and-mortar stores. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 232 brick-and-mortar retail stores, including 165 Steve Madden full-price stores, 66 Steve Madden outlet stores and one Dolce Vita full-price store. In addition, during 2022, we opened two concessions in Taiwan and one concession in China, ending the year with 20 Company-operated concessions in international markets. 
In addition to our stores, our Direct-to-Consumer business offers products online through our e-commerce sites in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe, Israel, South Africa and Asia. We operate six branded e-commerce sites, which include: www.stevemadden.com, www.dolcevita.com, www.betseyjohnson.com, www.blondo.com, www.greats.com, and www.superga-usa.com.
This segment represented 24.6% of total revenue during 2022.
First Cost
Our First Cost segment represents commission based activities where the Company serves as a buying agent for footwear products under private labels for select national chains, and value-priced retailers. As a buying agent, we utilize our expertise and our relationships with shoe manufacturers to facilitate the production of private label product to customer specifications. We believe that operating in the private label market leverages our overall sourcing and design capabilities. In addition, by leveraging the strength of our Steve Madden brands and product designs, we are able to partially recover our design and product development costs from our suppliers.
Licensing
Our Licensing segment is engaged in the licensing of the Steve Madden® and Betsey Johnson® trademarks for use in the sale of select apparel, accessory, and home categories as well as various other non-core products. Most of our license agreements require the licensee to pay us a royalty based on actual revenue, a minimum royalty in the event the specified revenue targets are not achieved and a percentage of sales for advertising the brand.
Corporate
Corporate does not constitute a reportable segment and includes costs not directly attributable to the segments. These costs are primarily related to expenses associated with corporate executives, corporate finance, legal, human resources, information technology, cyber security, corporate social responsibility, and other shared services.
For additional information on our segments, refer to Note S – Operating Segment Information in the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
OUR BRANDS
Steve Madden. We design, source, and market fashion-forward footwear, accessories, and apparel for women, men, and children under the Steve Madden brand. The Steve Madden brand is a leader in the fashion footwear industry with permission from the customer to sell products across most footwear categories including dress shoes, boots, booties, fashion sneakers, and casuals. While the brand appeals to a wide demographic, the core target consumer is 16 to 35 years old. The Steve Madden brand is sold globally, including the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Africa, and Latin America.
Dolce Vita. Dolce Vita® is a contemporary women's brand known for its effortless style for the modern individual. Dolce Vita is more than just shoes and handbags, it’s about creating a community, supporting underrepresented voices, and responsibly building a brand that we can be proud of with every step. The Dolce Vita brand is sold globally, including the U.S., Canada, Israel, Australia, and Indonesia. We acquired the Dolce Vita® footwear trademark in August of 2014 and in December 2021, we acquired the remaining intellectual property rights of Dolce Vita including handbags and other accessories.
Anne Klein. The Anne Klein® brand has a rich heritage going back over 50 years and is recognized for its dedication to timeless American classics. Anne Klein footwear and accessories are sold in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and Israel. We entered into a license agreement with WHP Global for a license to use the Anne Klein®, AK Sport®, AK Anne Klein Sport®, and Lion Head Design® (collectively "Anne Klein®") trademarks in connection with the design, marketing, and sale of footwear and accessories in January of 2018. 
Blondo. The Blondo® brand is a 100+ year-old footwear brand recognized for its quality water-resistant leather boots, booties, casual shoes and sneakers. The Blondo brand is primarily sold in the U.S. and Canada. We acquired the intellectual property and related assets of Blondo® in January of 2015.
GREATS. The GREATS® brand is a Brooklyn-based, digitally native footwear brand founded in 2014 which specializes in premium quality, responsibly made sneakers for men and women. The GREATS® brand is primarily sold in the U.S. We acquired the GREATS® brand in August of 2019. 
Mad Love. The Mad Love® brand is a beach-to-the-street lifestyle brand created to appeal to women with a young attitude and active lifestyle, and marketed exclusively to Target Corporation. In spring 2021, Mad Love® became a sustainable brand, designed and created with the mission to make our earth a better place. 
Superga. On February 9, 2011, we entered into a license agreement with Basic Properties America Inc. and BasicNet S.p.A., for the use of the Superga® trademark in connection with the marketing and sale of footwear. The Superga license was terminated as of December 31, 2022.
PRODUCT DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
We have established a reputation for our creative designs, marketing and trend-right products at affordable price points. Our future success will substantially depend on our ability to continue to anticipate and react quickly to changing consumer demands. To meet this objective, we have developed what we believe is an unparalleled design team and process. Our design team strives to create designs that are true to our DNA, reflect current or anticipated trends and can be manufactured in a timely and cost-effective manner. Most new products are tested in select Steve Madden retail stores and on www.stevemadden.com. Based on these tests, among other things, management selects products that are then offered for wholesale and direct-to-consumer distribution worldwide. We believe that our design and testing processes combined with our flexible sourcing model provide our brands with a significant competitive advantage and allow us to mitigate the risk of incurring costs associated with the production and distribution of less desirable designs.
MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY CHAIN
We source each of our product lines separately based on the individual design, style and quality specifications of our various brands and product categories. We do not own or operate any foreign manufacturing facilities; rather, we use agents and our own sourcing office to source our products from independently owned manufacturers primarily in China, Cambodia, Mexico, Brazil, Vietnam, India, Italy and other European countries. We have established relationships with a number of manufacturers and agents in each of these countries. We have not entered into any long-term manufacturing or supply contracts. We believe that a sufficient number of alternative sources exist for the manufacture of our products.
We continually monitor the availability of the principal raw materials used in our footwear, accessories, and apparel which are currently available from a number of sources in various parts of the world. We track inventory flow on a regular basis, monitor sell-through data and incorporate input on product demand from wholesale customers.
The suppliers and manufacturers of our products are required to adopt our Supplier Code of Conduct 2.0 which specifies that they comply with all local laws and regulations governing human rights, working conditions, anti-corruption laws, restricted substances, and environmental compliance, including animal welfare and conflicts minerals, before we conduct business with them. We are committed to working with manufacturers, suppliers, vendors, and agents that share our Company’s goal of maintaining socially responsible and sustainable business practices.
Our products are manufactured overseas and most of our products are shipped via ocean freight carriers to our third-party distribution facilities in California and to a lesser extent New Jersey, and via truck from Mexico to our third-party distribution facility in Texas. We rely to a lesser extent on air carriers for the shipping of products. Once our products arrive in the U.S., we distribute them mainly from six third-party distribution centers, four located in California, one located in Texas, and one located in New Jersey. Our products are also distributed through a Company-operated distribution center located in Canada and through our third-party distribution facilities in Mexico and Europe. By utilizing distribution facilities specializing in fulfillment for certain wholesale customers and Steve Madden retail stores we believe that our consumers are served more promptly and efficiently. Suppliers of products for our businesses in Canada, Mexico, Europe and our joint ventures in Israel, South Africa, China, Taiwan, Malaysia, and the Middle East ship to the respective countries. Products for our overseas distributors are shipped to freight forwarders primarily in China and Mexico where the distributor arranges for subsequent shipment. See Item 1A “Risk Factors” below for a discussion of the risk of supply chain disruptions. 
DISTRIBUTION
For the year ended December 31, 2022, our Wholesale segment and our Direct-to-Consumer segment generated revenue of approximately $1,589,566 and $521,729, or 74.9% and 24.6% of our total revenue, respectively. Each of these distribution channels is described below.
Wholesale. Our products are distributed in our wholesale channel to over 2,000 retailers, including department stores, mass merchants, off-price retailers, shoe chains, online retailers, national chains, specialty retailers, independent stores, and clubs throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Europe, and other international markets through our joint ventures in Israel, South Africa, China, Taiwan, Malaysia, and the Middle East along with special distribution arrangements in certain 
European countries, North Africa, South and Central America, Australia and various countries in Asia. Under the terms of the distribution agreements, the distributors and retailers purchase product from us and are generally required to open a minimum number of stores each year and to pay a fee for each pair of footwear purchased and an additional sales royalty as a percentage of sales or a predetermined amount per unit of sale. Most of the distributors are required to purchase a minimum number of our products within specified periods. The agreements currently in place expire on various dates and include automatic renewals at the distributors' option provided certain conditions are met.
Our top ten wholesale customers, in no particular order, include: Nordstrom, Macy's, Dillard's, DSW, The TJX Companies, Ross Stores, Burlington Stores, Amazon, Walmart, and Target. 
For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any customers who accounted for more than 10% of total revenue. At December 31, 2022, three customers accounted for 20.6%, 16.2%, and 11.1% of total accounts receivable. The Company did not have any other customers who accounted for more than 10% of total accounts receivable.
Direct-to-Consumer. Our Direct-to-Consumer channel consists of Steve Madden® and Dolce Vita® full-price retail stores, Steve Madden® outlet stores, Steve Madden® shop-in-shops and directly-operated e-commerce websites. Our retail stores are located in regional malls and shopping centers, as well as high streets in major cities across the United States, Canada, Mexico, Israel, South Africa, Taiwan, China, and the Middle East. Through our joint venture partnerships in China and Taiwan, we also have company-operated concessions. 
As of December 31, 2022, we operated 232 brick-and-mortar retail stores, including one Dolce Vita full-price store and 66 Steve Madden outlet stores, and six e-commerce websites. In addition, we had 20 Company-operated concessions in international markets. Out of the 232 total brick-and-mortar retail stores, 115 were located outside of the U.S.
COMPETITION
The fashion industry is highly competitive. We compete with numerous domestic and international footwear, apparel, and accessory companies. Our competitors may have greater financial and other resources than we do. We believe effective marketing and advertising, favorable brand image, fashionable styling, high quality, value, and fast manufacturing turnaround are the most important competitive factors, and we intend to continue to employ these elements in our business. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
MARKETING
We have focused on creating a full-funnel marketing strategy that covers all stages of the customer journey, to establish our Company as a leading designer and marketer of fashion footwear, accessories, and apparel for a diverse set of style-conscious consumers. Principal top of funnel marketing activities include digital brand marketing, social media and influencer marketing, experiential events, in-store and online promotions, and public relations focusing primarily on digital product and brand placements, celebrity seeding, as well as public and media appearances by our Founder, Creative and Design Chief, Steve Madden. We foster high value lifetime customer relationships with investments in marketing technology and talent, both in-house and via strategic partnerships with external agencies. We continue to promote our e-commerce websites where customers can purchase Steve Madden®, Dolce Vita®, Betsey Johnson®, Blondo®, and GREATS® products.
MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (MIS) OPERATIONS
Sophisticated information systems are essential to our ability to maintain our competitive position and to support our growth. Our Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system is an integrated system that supports our wholesale business in the areas of finance and accounting, manufacturing-sourcing, purchase order management, customer order management, and inventory control. All of our North American wholesale businesses (other than Canada, which has a separate ERP system) and our Asia sourcing operations are operated through this ERP system. Our warehouse management system is utilized by the majority of our third-party logistics providers and is fully integrated with our ERP system. A point-of-sale system for our U.S. retail stores is integrated with a retail inventory management/store replenishment system. We have transitioned our e-commerce software to a major cloud-based provider. Complementing all of these systems are ancillary systems and third-party information processing services, including, among others, supply chain, business intelligence/data warehouse, Electronic Data Interchange, credit card processing, and payroll. We undertake updates of all of these management information systems on a periodic basis in order to ensure that our functionality is continuously improved. 
INFORMATION SYSTEMS
The Company maintains its information technology and security policies, comprised of risk management policies and procedures surrounding the Company’s information systems, cybersecurity practices and protection of confidential information. The Company’s Chief Information Security Officer has ultimate oversight of the Company’s cyber risk management policies and procedures, and chairs quarterly Information Security Steering Committee meetings, which provides cooperation, collaboration, and consensus driven information security guidance to both the Information Technology Department, and the Company as a whole. Additionally, the Board of Directors receives quarterly updates on these topics. As part of the Company’s information security program, all global employees are required to take annual training on information security awareness, including cybersecurity, global data privacy requirements and IT compliance measures. We also conduct periodic third-party assessments to test our cybersecurity controls, including our ecommerce sites, our mobile applications, corporate systems and network security (including Wi-Fi), and store systems, point-of-sale software and network security (including Wi-Fi). Additionally, we maintain network security and cyber liability insurance in order to provide a level of financial protection in the event of certain covered cyber losses and data breaches.
TRADEMARKS 
Our strategy for the continued growth of our business includes expanding our presence beyond footwear, accessories, and apparel through the selective licensing of our brands. We consider our Company-owned trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and have registered many of our marks in the United States and 149 other countries and in numerous International Classes. From time to time, we adopt new trademarks and new logos and/or stylized versions of our trademarks in connection with the marketing of new product lines. We believe that these trademarks have significant value and are important for purposes of identifying our Company, the marketing of our products and the products of our licensees, and distinguishing them from the products of others. 
Trademarks we believe to be most significant to our business include: Steve Madden®, Madden Girl®, Madden NYC®, Betsey Johnson®, LUV BETSEY by Betsey Johnson Design®, Dolce Vita®, DV®, DV Dolce Vita®, MadLove®, Blondo®, Blondo Waterproof plus Heart®, Steven®, SM Pass®, and GREATS®. We license our Steve Madden® trademark for use in connection with the manufacture, marketing, and sale of women’s outerwear, sleepwear and intimates, hosiery, jewelry, hair accessories, watches, eyeglasses, sunglasses, umbrellas, bedding and bath, luggage, fragrance, children’s apparel, and men’s leather accessories. We license the Betsey Johnson® trademark for use in connection with the manufacture, marketing, and sale of women's and children’s apparel, hosiery, fragrance and beauty, medical scrubs, jewelry, watches, eyeglasses, sunglasses, stationary, bedding and bath, luggage, umbrellas, and self-care products.
In addition to the licensing of our trademarks, we in-license the trademarks of third parties for use in connection with certain of our product lines. Generally, these licensing arrangements require us to make advertising payments to the licensor as well as royalty payments equal to a percentage of our revenue and/or a minimum royalty and in some cases additional payments in the event that specified revenue targets are not achieved. 
For additional information on our licensing arrangements, refer to Note B – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note O – Commitments, Contingencies and Other in the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES 
As of February 1, 2023, we employed approximately 4,000 employees globally, with approximately 2,200 of these employees located in the United States and 1,800 located internationally. Of these employees, approximately 2,800 work full-time and approximately 1,200 work part-time. Most of our part-time employees work in the Direct-to-Consumer segment. None of our employees are represented by a union. Our management considers relations with our employees to be good. We have never experienced a material interruption of our operations due to a labor dispute. 
Culture 
Steve Madden is for the bold, expressive, and ambitious. Our core values – authenticity, initiative, tenacity, humility, and trust are key to our competitive edge and are embedded throughout all levels of our Company. They motivate our growth, inspire our innovation, define our culture, and set the standard for all of our actions. 
•Authenticity: Show up to work as your true self 
•Initiative: Act upon good ideas quickly and be ready to iterate 
•Tenacity: Look at problems from all sides and be resourceful 
•Humility: Think from the perspective of others and always be open to learning
•Trust: Build strong relationships with good will and integrity
Career Development 
The fashion landscape is constantly shifting and evolving, which makes it especially important for us to invest in the ongoing career development of our employees. In service of this objective, we constantly seek out, promote and improve upon internal programs and processes that make it possible for our employees to reach their full potential. Some examples of this focus include our ongoing professional development relationship with the University of Arizona Global Campus, our tuition reimbursement program, our internal employee learning opportunities, and external conference and workshop offerings around specific industry content as well as leadership, coaching, and management training. In addition, in 2021 we launched SM Learning Sessions, a monthly, Company-wide training and development program where we invite internal and external subject matter experts to present on various topics. Mentoring, annual performance evaluations and feedback are also key elements of our career development efforts at our Company. 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
We believe that recruiting, employing, and retaining people from all backgrounds, ethnicities, genders, lifestyles, and belief systems have been the cornerstones of meeting the needs of our diverse consumer base and building a global business. By embracing a diverse and inclusive workplace, we create an environment that offers all our employees opportunities to succeed. We want all our employees to be as successful as they can be and to reach their full potential no matter who they are, where they are from, or what they believe. In the spirit of this core belief, we strive to build an increasingly inclusive culture where all employees feel free to express themselves and have opportunities to grow. A few highlights of our diversity initiatives include: 
•we established a Diversity and Inclusion Council made up of key leaders in our Company to oversee the implementation of our detailed Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Strategic Plan;
•we added three new members to our Board of Directors, each of whom are people of color and bring new perspectives to the highest level of Company leadership;
•our employees formed three employee resource groups – one for Black employees and allies called Black Sole, one for LGBTQ+ employees and allies called SM Pride, and one for Hispanic employees and allies called De La Sole;
•we launched “Tune-In Tuesday,” a weekly email of internal job openings to encourage career development and advancement; 
•we signed the “Open to All” pledge with other major brands and retailers; 
•we joined the Black in Fashion Council;
•we implemented Company-wide diversity and inclusion training;
•we joined Hive Diversity as well as contributed $100,000 to Howard University and partnered with the university to establish diverse pipelines of talent and expand our recruiting; and 
•we launched Adaptive Kids footwear, soon to expand to adults. 
Wellness 
We see personal health and fitness of our employees as key to long-term professional success, which is why we offer benefits and programs focused on physical, emotional and financial well-being. These include mindfulness and meditation training, financial wellness seminars, health fairs, discounted gym memberships, free flu shots, paid-time-off to receive COVID-19 vaccination and boosters, on-site COVID testing and on-site discounted food. We also offer an Employee Assistance Program with a range of programs, resources and tools that can help with various issues. To help manage work-life balance, we offer a paid membership to Care.com so employees can find childcare, senior care, special needs care and other related services. 
Charitable Giving
In December 2021, the Company formed The Steve Madden Corporate Foundation, a donor-advised fund established under Fidelity Charitable and managed by Rockefeller Capital Management. As part of the Company's charitable giving strategy, we made a $1 million contribution for each of 2022 and 2021, and we have since launched multiple shop-to-give campaigns across our various Company-owned e-commerce websites.
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS 
Our business is subject to various United States federal state, and local and foreign laws and regulations, including environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. In addition, we may incur liability under environmental statutes and regulations with respect to the contamination of sites that we own or operate or previously owned or operated (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites and neighboring properties, or other persons) and the off-site disposal of hazardous materials. We believe our operations are in compliance with the terms of all applicable laws and regulations and our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.
SEASONALITY AND OTHER FACTORS 
Our operating results are subject to some variability due to seasonality and other factors. For example, the highest percentage of our boot sales occur in the fall and winter months (our third and fourth fiscal quarters) and the highest percentage of our sandal sales occur in the spring and summer months (our first and second fiscal quarters). Historically, some of our businesses, including our Direct-to-Consumer segment, have experienced holiday retail seasonality. Our diverse range of product offerings, however, provides some mitigation to the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items. In addition to seasonal fluctuations, our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the weather, the timing of holidays and larger shipments of footwear, market acceptance of our products, pricing and presentation of the products offered and sold, the hiring and training of additional personnel, inventory write downs for obsolescence, the cost of materials, the product mix among our wholesale, direct-to-consumer and licensing businesses, the incurrence of other operating costs and factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions and actions of competitors. Revenue levels in any period are also impacted by customer decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels in response to anticipated consumer demand. Our customers may cancel orders, change delivery dates or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us.
BACKLOG
We had unfilled wholesale customer orders of approximately $500,921 and $839,381, as of February 1, 2023 and February 1, 2022, respectively. Our backlog at a particular time is affected by a number of factors, including seasonality, supply chain lead time, timing of market weeks, and wholesale customer purchases of our core products through our open stock program. Accordingly, a comparison of backlog from period to period may not be indicative of eventual shipments.
