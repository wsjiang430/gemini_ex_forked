Item 1. Business.
Business Overview
Icahn Enterprises L.P. (“Icahn Enterprises”) is a master limited partnership formed in Delaware on February 17, 1987. Icahn Enterprises Holdings L.P. (“Icahn Enterprises Holdings”) is a limited partnership formed in Delaware on February 17, 1987. References to "we," "our" or "us" herein include both Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings and their subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. 
Icahn Enterprises owns a 99% limited partner interest in Icahn Enterprises Holdings. Icahn Enterprises G.P. Inc. (“Icahn Enterprises GP”), which is indirectly owned and controlled by Mr. Carl C. Icahn, owns a 1% general partner interest in each of Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings as of December 31, 2018. Icahn Enterprises Holdings and its subsidiaries own substantially all of our assets and liabilities and conduct substantially all of our operations. Therefore, the financial results of Icahn Enterprises and Icahn Enterprises Holdings are substantially the same, with differences relating primarily to the allocation of the general partner interest, which is reflected as an aggregate 1.99% general partner interest in the financial statements of Icahn Enterprises. Mr. Icahn and his affiliates owned approximately 91.7% of Icahn Enterprises' outstanding depositary units as of February 28, 2019. 
We conduct and plan to continue to conduct our activities in such a manner as not to be deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Company Act”). Therefore, no more than 40% of our total assets can be invested in investment securities, as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act. In addition, we do not invest or intend to invest in securities as our primary business. We intend to structure our investments to continue to be taxed as a partnership rather than as a corporation under the applicable publicly traded partnership rules of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended.
Mr. Icahn's estate has been designed to assure the stability and continuation of Icahn Enterprises with no need to monetize his interests for estate tax or other purposes. In the event of Mr. Icahn's death, control of Mr. Icahn's interests in Icahn Enterprises and its general partner will be placed in charitable and other trusts under the control of senior Icahn Enterprises executives and family members.
We are a diversified holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in the following operating businesses: Investment, Energy, Automotive, Food Packaging, Metals, Real Estate, Home Fashion, Mining and, prior to September 2018, Railcar, as discussed further below. 
Business Strategy and Core Strengths
The Icahn Strategy
Across all of our businesses, our success is based on a simple formula: we seek to find undervalued companies in the Graham & Dodd tradition, a methodology for valuing stocks that primarily looks for deeply depressed prices. However, while the typical Graham & Dodd value investor purchases undervalued securities and waits for results, we often become actively involved in the companies we target. That activity may involve a broad range of approaches, from influencing the management of a target to take steps to improve shareholder value, to acquiring a controlling interest or outright ownership of the target company in order to implement changes that we believe are required to improve its business, and then operating and expanding that business. This activism has typically brought about very strong returns over the years.
Today, we are a diversified holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in eight diversified reporting segments. As of December 31, 2018, through our Investment segment, we have significant positions in various investments, which include Herbalife Ltd. (HLF), Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG), Newell Brands, Inc. (NWL), Dell Technologies Inc. Class C (DELL), Diamondback Energy, Inc. (FANG), Xerox Corporation (XRX), Navistar International Corp. (NAV), Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. (HTZ) and Conduent Incorporated (CNDT).
Several of our operating businesses started out as investment positions in debt or equity securities, held either directly by us or Mr. Icahn. Those positions ultimately resulted in control or complete ownership of the target company. For example, in 2012, we acquired a controlling interest in CVR Energy, Inc. (‘‘CVR Energy’’), which started out as a position in our Investment segment and is now an operating subsidiary that comprises our Energy segment. The acquisition of CVR Energy, like our other operating subsidiaries, reflects our opportunistic approach to value creation, through which returns may be obtained by, among other things, promoting change through minority positions at targeted companies in our Investment segment or by acquiring control of those target companies that we believe we could run more profitably ourselves.
During the next several years, we see a favorable opportunity to follow an activist strategy that centers on the purchase of target stock and the subsequent removal of any barriers that might interfere with a friendly purchase offer from a strong buyer. 
Alternatively, in appropriate circumstances, we or our subsidiaries may become the buyer of target companies, adding them to our portfolio of operating subsidiaries, thereby expanding our operations through such opportunistic acquisitions. We believe that the companies that we target for our activist activities are undervalued for many reasons, often including inept management. Unfortunately for the individual investor, in particular, and the economy, in general, many poor management teams are often unaccountable and very difficult to remove.
Unlike the individual investor, we have the wherewithal to purchase companies that we feel we can operate more effectively than incumbent management. In addition, through our Investment segment, we are in a position to pursue our activist strategy by purchasing stock or debt positions and trying to promulgate change through a variety of activist approaches, ranging from speaking and negotiating with Boards of Directors and Chief Executive Officers ("CEO") to proxy fights, tender offers and acquiring control. We work diligently to enhance value for all shareholders and we believe that the best way to do this is to make underperforming management teams and Boards of Directors accountable or to replace them.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of our general partner, Carl C. Icahn, has been an activist investor since 1980. Mr. Icahn believes that the current environment continues to be conducive to activism. Many major companies have substantial amounts of cash. We believe that they are hoarding cash, rather than spending it, because they do not believe investments in their business will translate to earnings.
We believe that one of the best ways for many cash-rich companies to achieve increased earnings is to use their large amounts of excess cash, together with advantageous borrowing opportunities, to purchase other companies in their industries and take advantage of the meaningful synergies that could result. In our opinion, the CEOs and Boards of Directors of undervalued companies that would be acquisition targets are the major road blocks to this logical use of assets to increase value, because we believe those CEOs and Boards of Directors are not willing to give up their power and perquisites, even if they have done a poor job in administering the companies they have been running. In addition, acquirers are often unwilling to undertake the arduous task of launching a hostile campaign. This is precisely the situation in which we believe a strong activist catalyst is necessary.
We believe that the activist catalyst adds value because, for companies with strong balance sheets, acquisitions of their weaker industry rivals is often extremely compelling financially. We further believe that there are many transactions that make economic sense, even at a large premium over market. Acquirers can use their excess cash, that is earning a very low return, and/or borrow at the advantageous interest rates now available, to acquire a target company. In either case, an acquirer can add the target company’s earnings and the income from synergies to the acquirer’s bottom line, at a relatively low cost. But for these potential acquirers to act, the target company must be willing to at least entertain an offer. We believe that often the activist can step in and remove the obstacles that a target generally may seek to use to prevent an acquisition.
It is our belief that our strategy will continue to produce strong results into the future. We believe that the strong cash flow and asset coverage from our operating subsidiaries will allow us to maintain a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity.
Core Strengths
We believe that our core strengths include: identifying and acquiring undervalued assets and businesses, often through the purchase of distressed securities; increasing value through management, financial or other operational changes; and managing complex legal, regulatory or financial issues, which may include bankruptcy or insolvency, environmental, zoning, permitting and licensing issues.
The key elements of our business strategy include the following:
Capitalize on Growth Opportunities in our Existing Businesses.  We believe that we have developed a strong portfolio of businesses with experienced management teams. We may expand our existing businesses if appropriate opportunities are identified, as well as use our established businesses as a platform for additional acquisitions in the same or related areas.
Drive Accountability and Financial Discipline in the Management of our Business. Our CEO is accountable directly to our Board of Directors of our general partner, including the Chairman, Carl C. Icahn, and has day-to-day responsibility, in consultation with our Chairman, for general oversight of our business segments. We continually evaluate our operating subsidiaries with a view towards maximizing value and cost efficiencies, bringing an owner's perspective to our operating businesses. In each of these businesses, we assemble senior management teams with the expertise to run their businesses and boards of directors to oversee the management of those businesses. Each management team is responsible for the day-to-day operations of its businesses and directly accountable to its board of directors. 
Seek to Acquire Undervalued Assets.  We intend to continue to make investments in businesses that we believe are undervalued and have potential for growth. We also seek to capitalize on investment opportunities arising from market inefficiencies, economic or market trends that have not been identified and reflected in market value, or complex or special situations. Certain opportunities may arise from companies that experience disappointing financial results, liquidity or capital needs, lowered credit ratings, revised industry forecasts or legal complications. We may acquire businesses or assets directly or 
we may establish an ownership position through the purchase of debt or equity securities in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.
Use Activism to Unlock Value. As described above, we become actively involved in companies in which we invest.  Such activism may involve a broad range of activities, from trying to influence management in a proxy fight, to taking outright control of a company in order to bring about the change we think is required to unlock value. The key is flexibility, permanent capital and the willingness and ability to have a long-term investment horizon.
Business Description
Icahn Enterprises began as American Real Estate Partners L.P. in 1987 and currently operates a portfolio of eight diversified reporting segments, as discussed above. With the exception of our Investment segment, our operating segments primarily comprise independently operated businesses that we have obtained a controlling interest in through execution of our business strategy. Our Investment segment derives revenues from gains and losses from investment transactions. Our other operating segments derive revenues principally from net sales of various products, primarily within our Energy and Automotive segments, which together accounted for the significant majority of our consolidated net sales for each of the three years ended December 31, 2018. Our other operating segments' revenues are also derived through various other revenue streams which primarily consists of automotive services and real estate leasing operations. The majority of our consolidated revenues are derived from customers in the United States. Our Food Packaging and Mining segments account for the majority of our consolidated revenues derived from customers outside the United States. 
Investment
Our Investment segment is comprised of various private investment funds ("Investment Funds") in which we have general partner interests and through which we invest our proprietary capital. We and certain of Mr. Icahn's wholly-owned affiliates are the sole investors in the Investment Funds. As general partner, we provide investment advisory and certain administrative and back office services to the Investment Funds but do not provide such services to any other entities, individuals or accounts. Interests in the Investment Funds are not offered to outside investors. 
Investment Strategy
The investment strategy of the Investment Funds is set and led by Mr. Icahn. The Investment Funds seek to acquire securities in companies that trade at a discount to inherent value as determined by various metrics, including replacement cost, break-up value, cash flow and earnings power and liquidation value.
The Investment Funds utilize a process-oriented, research-intensive, value-based investment approach. This approach generally involves three critical steps: (i) fundamental credit, valuation and capital structure analysis; (ii) intense legal and tax analysis of fulcrum issues such as litigation and regulation that often affect valuation; and (iii) combined business valuation analysis and legal and tax review to establish a strategy for gaining an attractive risk-adjusted investment position. This approach focuses on exploiting market dislocations or misjudgments that may result from market euphoria, litigation, complex contingent liabilities, corporate malfeasance and weak corporate governance, general economic conditions or market cycles and complex and inappropriate capital structures.
The Investment Funds are often activist investors ready to take the steps necessary to seek to unlock value, including tender offers, proxy contests and demands for management accountability. The Investment Funds may employ a number of strategies and are permitted to invest across a variety of industries and types of securities, including long and short equities, long and short bonds, bank debt and other corporate obligations, options, swaps and other derivative instruments thereof, risk arbitrage and capital structure arbitrage and other special situations. The Investment Funds invest a material portion of their capital in publicly traded equity and debt securities of companies that they believe to be undervalued by the marketplace. The Investment Funds often take significant positions in the companies in which they invest.
Income
Our Investment segment's income or loss is driven by the amount of funds allocated to the Investment Funds and the performance of the underlying investments in the Investment Funds. Funds allocated to the Investment Funds are based on the net contributions and redemptions by our Holding Company and by Mr. Icahn and his affiliates. 
Affiliate Investments
We and Mr. Icahn, along with the Investment Funds, have entered into a covered affiliate agreement, which was amended on March 31, 2011, pursuant to which Mr. Icahn agreed (on behalf of himself and certain of his affiliates, excluding Icahn Enterprises, Icahn Enterprises Holdings and their subsidiaries) to be bound by certain restrictions on their investments in any assets that we deem suitable for the Investment Funds, other than government and agency bonds and cash equivalents, unless otherwise approved by our Audit Committee. In addition, Mr. Icahn and such affiliates continue to have the right to co-invest 
with the Investment Funds. We have no interest in, nor do we generate any income from, any such co-investments, which have been and may continue to be substantial.
Energy
We conduct our Energy segment through our majority owned subsidiary, CVR Energy. We acquired a controlling interest in CVR Energy in 2012 through a cash tender offer for outstanding shares of CVR Energy common stock. CVR Energy is a reporting company under the Exchange Act and files annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") that are publicly available.
CVR Energy is a diversified holding company primarily engaged in the petroleum refining and nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing businesses through its interests in CVR Refining, LP ("CVR Refining") and CVR Partners, LP ("CVR Partners"), respectively. CVR Refining is an independent petroleum refiner and marketer of high value transportation fuels. CVR Partners produces and markets nitrogen fertilizers in the form of ammonia and urea ammonium nitrate ("UAN"). 
CVR Energy has a general partner interest in CVR Refining and CVR Partners and also owns approximately 80.6% of the outstanding common units of CVR Refining and 34.4% of the outstanding common units of CVR Partners as of December 31, 2018. On August 1, 2018, CVR Energy completed an exchange offer whereby CVR Refining's public unitholders tendered a total of 21,625,106 common units of CVR Refining in exchange for 13,699,549 shares of CVR Energy common stock. As of December 31, 2018, we owned approximately 70.8% of the total outstanding common stock of CVR Energy. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, we directly owned approximately 3.9% of the total outstanding common units of CVR Refining. 
On January 29, 2019, CVR Energy, pursuant to the exercise of its right under the partnership agreement of CVR Refining to purchase all of the issued and outstanding common units in CVR Refining, purchased the remaining common units of CVR Refining not already owned by CVR Energy, including the purchase of CVR Refining common units owned directly by us. As a result, as of January 29, 2019, CVR Energy owns all of the common units of CVR Refining and we no longer have any direct ownership in CVR Refining. In addition, the common units of CVR Refining have subsequently ceased to be publicly traded or listed on the New York Stock Exchange or any other national securities exchange. 
Our Energy segment's net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 represented approximately 67%, 64% and 62%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales, primarily from the sale of its petroleum products.
Products, Raw Materials and Supply
CVR Refining has the capability to process a variety of crude oil blends. CVR Refining's oil refineries in Coffeyville, Kansas and Wynnewood, Oklahoma have a combined capacity of 206,500 barrels per day. In addition to the use of third-party pipelines for the supply of crude oil, CVR Refining has an extensive gathering system consisting of logistics assets that are owned, leased or part of a joint venture operation. Petroleum refining product yield includes gasoline, diesel fuel, pet coke and other refined products such as natural gas liquids, asphalt and jet fuel among other products. 
CVR Partners produces and distributes nitrogen fertilizer products, which are used by farmers to improve the yield and quality of their crops. The principal products are UAN and ammonia. CVR Partners' Coffeyville, Kansas facility uses pet coke to produce nitrogen fertilizer and is supplied primarily by its adjacent crude oil refinery pursuant to a renewable long-term agreement with CVR Refining. Historically, the Coffeyville nitrogen fertilizer plant has obtained the remainder of its pet coke requirements from third parties such as other Midwestern refineries or pet coke brokers at spot-prices. CVR Partners' East Dubuque, Illinois facility uses natural gas to produce nitrogen fertilizer. The East Dubuque facility is able to purchase natural gas at competitive prices due to its connection to the Norther Natural Gas interstate pipeline system, which is within one mile of the facility, and the ANR Pipeline Company pipeline. 
Customers, Marketing and Distribution
Customers for CVR Refining's products primarily include retailers, railroads, and farm cooperatives and other refiners/marketers in Group 3 of the PADD II region because of their relative proximity to the refineries and pipeline access. CVR Refining sells bulk products to long-standing customers at spot market prices based on a Group 3 basis differential to prices quoted on the New York Mercantile Exchange, which are reported by industry market-related indices such as Platts and Oil Price Information Service. CVR Refining's rack sales are at posted prices that are influenced by competitor pricing and Group 3 spot market differentials. Additionally, CVR Refining supplies jet fuel to the U.S. Department of Defense. For the year ended December 31, 2018, only one customer accounted for 10% or more of CVR Refining's net sales.
CVR Refining focuses its marketing efforts in the central mid-continent area because of its relative proximity to its refineries and pipeline access. CVR Refining engages in rack marketing, which is the supply of product through tanker trucks and railcars directly to customers located in close geographic proximity to its refineries and to customers at throughput terminals on third-party refined products distribution systems. CVR Refining also makes bulk sales (sales into third-party pipelines) into mid-continent markets and other destinations utilizing third-party product pipeline networks. 
CVR Partners sells UAN products to retailers and distributors and ammonia to agricultural and industrial customers. Its products are primarily distributed by truck or by railcar. Given the nature of its business, and consistent with industry practice, CVR Partners does not have long-term minimum purchase contracts with most of its agricultural customers.
Competition
CVR Energy's petroleum business competes primarily on the basis of price, reliability of supply, availability of multiple grades of products and location. The principal competitive factors affecting its refining operations are cost of crude oil and other feedstocks, refinery complexity, refinery efficiency, refinery product mix and product distribution and transportation costs. The location of refineries provides the petroleum business with a reliable supply of crude oil and a transportation cost advantage over its competitors. The petroleum business primarily competes against five refineries operated in the mid-continent region. In addition to these refineries, the refineries compete against trading companies, as well as other refineries located outside the region that are linked to the mid-continent market through an extensive product pipeline system. These competitors include refineries located near the Gulf Coast, the Great Lakes and the Texas panhandle regions. 
The nitrogen fertilizer business has experienced, and expects to continue to meet, significant levels of competition from current and potential competitors, many of whom have significantly greater financial and other resources. Competition in the nitrogen fertilizer industry is dominated by price considerations. However, during the spring and fall application seasons, farming activities intensify and delivery capacity is a significant competitive factor. Domestic competition is intense due to customers' sophisticated buying tendencies and competitor strategies that focus on cost and service. The nitrogen fertilizer business also encounters competition from producers of fertilizer products manufactured in foreign countries. In certain cases, foreign producers of fertilizer who export to the United States may be subsidized by their respective governments.
Environmental Regulations
CVR Energy's petroleum and nitrogen fertilizer businesses are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state and local, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing the emission and release of hazardous substances into the environment, the treatment and discharge of waste water, and the storage, handling, use and transportation of petroleum and nitrogen products, and the characteristics and composition of gasoline, diesel fuels, UAN and ammonia. These laws and regulations, their underlying regulatory requirements, and the enforcement thereof, impact the petroleum business and operations and the nitrogen fertilizer business and operations by imposing:

• | restrictions on operations or the need to install enhanced or additional controls;


• | the need to obtain and comply with permits, licenses and authorizations;


• | liability for the investigation and remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater at current and former facilities (if any) and for off-site waste disposal locations; and


• | specifications for the products marketed by the petroleum business and the nitrogen fertilizer business, primarily gasoline, diesel fuel, UAN and ammonia.

CVR Energy's operations require numerous permits, licenses and authorizations. Failure to comply with these permits or environmental laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties or other sanctions or a revocation of CVR Energy's permits. In addition, the laws and regulations to which CVR Energy is subject to are often evolving and many of them have become more stringent or have become subject to more stringent interpretation or enforcement by federal or state agencies. These laws and regulations could result in increased capital, operating and compliance costs. 
CVR Energy's businesses are also subject to, or impacted by, various other environmental laws and regulations such as the federal Clean Air Act, the federal Clean Water Act, release reporting requirements relating to the release of hazardous substances into the environment, certain fuel regulations, renewable fuel standards, as discussed below, and various other laws and regulations. 
Renewable Fuel Standards
CVR Refining is subject to the renewable fuel standards which requires refiners to either blend "renewable fuels" with their transportation fuels or purchase renewable fuel credits, known as renewable identification numbers, in lieu of blending. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors" and Note 17, "Commitments and Contingencies," to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
Safety, Health and Security Matters
CVR Energy is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations related to safety, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA") and comparable state statutes, the purpose of which are to protect the health and safety of workers. CVR Energy is also subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. 
CVR Energy operates a comprehensive safety, health and security program, with participation by employees at all levels of the organization. They have developed comprehensive safety programs aimed at preventing OSHA recordable incidents. Despite CVR Energy's efforts to achieve excellence in its safety and health performance, there can be no assurances that there will not be accidents resulting in injuries or even fatalities. CVR Energy routinely audits its programs and considers improvements in its management systems.
Automotive
We conduct our Automotive segment through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Icahn Automotive Group LLC ("Icahn Automotive"). 
Icahn Automotive was formed by us to invest in and operate businesses involved in automotive repair and maintenance services as well as the distribution and sale of automotive aftermarket parts and accessories to end-user do-it-yourself customers, wholesale distributors, and professional auto mechanics. Icahn Automotive acquired IEH Auto Parts Holding LLC in 2015, The Pep Boys - Manny, Moe & Jack in 2016, the franchise businesses of Precision Tune Auto Care and American Driveline Systems, the franchisor of AAMCO and Cottman Transmission service centers, in 2017, and various other businesses in recent years. 
Our Automotive segment's net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 represented approximately 22%, 24% and 27%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales.
Products, Services and Customers
The automotive aftermarket industry is in the mature stage of its life cycle. Over the past decade, consumers have moved away from do-it-yourself (retail) toward do-it-for-me (services) due to increasing vehicle complexity and electronic content, as well as decreasing availability of diagnostic equipment and know-how. Consistent with this long-term trend, Icahn Automotive's long-term strategy is to grow its commercial parts sales to automotive services businesses as well to grow its own automotive service business, while maintaining its retail parts customer bases by offering the newest and broadest product assortment in the automotive aftermarket. Icahn Automotive provides its customers with access to over two million replacement parts for domestic and imported vehicles through an extensive network of suppliers. Icahn Automotive seeks to provide (i) an extensive selection of product offerings, (ii) competitive pricing, (iii) exceptional in-store service experience and (iv) superior delivery to its customers.
Suppliers
Icahn Automotive purchases parts from manufacturers and other distributors for sale in the aftermarket. Purchases are made based on current inventory or operational needs and are fulfilled by suppliers within short periods of time. During 2018, Icahn Automotive's ten largest suppliers accounted for approximately 48% of the merchandise purchased and one supplier accounted for more than 10% of the merchandise purchased. Icahn Automotive believes that the relationships that it has established with its suppliers are generally positive. In the past, Icahn Automotive has not experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory sources of supply and it believes that adequate alternative sources of supply exist, at similar cost, for the types of merchandise sold in its stores.
Competition
Icahn Automotive operates in a highly competitive environment. Icahn Automotive's competitors for automotive service include national and regional chains, automotive dealerships, and local independent service providers. Its competitors for distribution and sales of auto parts and accessories include general, full range and discount retailers, national and regional auto parts retailers, and online retailers which carry automotive parts and accessories. Icahn Automotive believes that its operations in both do-it-for-me and do-it-yourself differentiates it from most of their competitors.
Food Packaging
We conduct our Food Packaging segment through our majority owned subsidiary, Viskase Companies, Inc. ("Viskase"). We acquired a controlling interest in Viskase in 2010 from affiliates of Mr. Icahn in a common control transaction. In January 2018, we increased our ownership in Viskase as a result of a rights offering and as of December 31, 2018, we owned approximately 78.6% of the total outstanding common stock of Viskase. Viskase is a producer of cellulosic, fibrous and plastic casings used to prepare and package processed meat products. Approximately 71% of Viskase's net sales during 2018 were derived from customers outside the United States.
Metals
We conduct our Metals segment through our wholly-owned subsidiary, PSC Metals LLC, f/k/a, PSC Metals, Inc. (“PSC Metals”). We acquired PSC Metals in 2007 from affiliates of Mr. Icahn in a common control transaction. PSC Metals is principally engaged in the business of collecting, processing and selling ferrous and non-ferrous metals, as well as the 
processing and distribution of steel pipe and plate products in the Midwest and Southern United States. PSC Metals collects industrial and obsolete scrap metal, processes it into reusable forms and supplies the recycled metals to its customers.
Real Estate
Our Real Estate operations consist primarily of rental real estate, property development and associated club activities. Our rental real estate operations consist primarily of office and industrial properties leased to single corporate tenants. Our property development operations are run primarily through a real estate investment, management and development subsidiary that focuses primarily on the construction and sale of single-family and multi-family homes, lots in subdivisions and planned communities, and raw land for residential development. Our property development locations also operate golf and club operations. In addition, our Real Estate operations also includes a hotel, timeshare and casino resort property in Aruba as well as a casino property in Atlantic City, New Jersey, which ceased operations in September 2014 prior to our obtaining control of the property.
Home Fashion
We conduct our Home Fashion segment through our wholly-owned subsidiary, WestPoint Home LLC (“WPH”). We acquired a controlling interest in WPH, previously known as WestPoint International, Inc., out of bankruptcy in 2005 and became sole owner of WPH in 2011. WPH's business consists of manufacturing, sourcing, marketing, distributing and selling home fashion consumer products. 
Mining
We conduct our Mining segment through our majority owned subsidiary, Ferrous Resources Ltd ("Ferrous Resources"). We acquired a controlling interest in Ferrous Resources in 2015 through a cash tender offer for outstanding shares of Ferrous Resources common stock. As of December 31, 2018, we owned approximately 77.2% of the total outstanding common stock of Ferrous Resources. Ferrous Resources acquired certain rights to iron ore mineral resources in Brazil and develops mining operations and related infrastructure to produce and sell iron ore products to the global steel industry. 
On December 5, 2018, we announced a definitive agreement to sell Ferrous Resources. The transaction is expected to close in 2019. 
Railcar
We conducted our Railcar segment through our wholly-owned subsidiary, American Railcar Leasing, LLC ("ARL"). We acquired a controlling interest in ARL in 2010 from affiliates of Mr. Icahn in a common control transaction and acquired the remaining interests in ARL in 2016 from affiliates of Mr. Icahn. ARL operated a leasing business consisting of purchased railcars leased to third parties under operating leases. 
On June 1, 2017 we sold ARL along with a majority of its railcar lease fleet. We sold the remaining railcars previously owned by ARL throughout the remainder of 2017 and the first nine months of 2018. As a result, as of December 31, 2018, our business no longer includes an active Railcar segment.
Discontinued Operations
In addition to certain dispositions described above, the following businesses were sold in 2018 and reclassified as discontinued operations. 
Federal-Mogul LLC

Federal-Mogul was previously reported within our Automotive segment prior to its reclassification as discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2018. In January 2017, we increased our ownership in Federal-Mogul to 100%. In February 2017, Federal-Mogul was converted from a Delaware corporation to a Delaware limited liability company. Prior to this, Federal-Mogul was a majority owned subsidiary of ours with publicly traded common stock. In April 2018, we entered into an agreement to sell Federal-Mogul to Tenneco Inc. ("Tenneco").
