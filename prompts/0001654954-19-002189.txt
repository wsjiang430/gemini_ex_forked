 ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
  
  OVERVIEW
  
 We are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and delivering medicines for patients with B-cell mediated diseases, including Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). We have developed a robust B-cell directed research and development (R&D) platform for identification of key B-cell pathways of interest and rapid clinical testing. Currently, we have five B-cell targeted drug candidates in clinical development, with the lead two therapies, ublituximab (TG-1101) and umbralisib (TGR-1202), in pivotal trials for CLL, NHL and MS. Ublituximab is a novel anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that has been glycoengineered for enhanced potency over first generation antibodies. Umbralisib is an oral, once daily inhibitor of PI3K delta. Umbralisib also uniquely inhibits CK1-epsilon, which may allow it to overcome certain tolerability issues associated with first generation PI3K delta inhibitors. When used together in combination therapy, ublituximab and umbralisib are referred to as ("U2"), or "1303". Additionally, in early clinical development we have an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody referred to as TG-1501, an oral Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (“BTK”) inhibitor referred to as TG-1701, and an anti-CD47/CD19 bispecific antibody referred to as TG-1801.
  We also actively evaluate complementary products, technologies and companies for in-licensing, partnership, acquisition and/or investment opportunities. To date, we have not received approval for the sale of any of our drug candidates in any market and, therefore, have not generated any product sales from our drug candidates.
  
  Current Phase 3 or Registration Directed Clinical Trial Highlights:
  
   ●
 Umbralisib Single Agent Cohorts of UNITY-NHL Phase 2b Trial: UNITY-NHL is a Phase 2b registration-directed clinical trial evaluating umbralisib monotherapy and the U2 combination in previously treated patients with NHL. Currently the follicular lymphoma (FL)/ small lymphocytic leukemia (SLL) and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) single agent umbralisib cohorts of this trial have been fully enrolled. In February 2019, we announced that the MZL cohort met the primary endpoint of Overall Response Rate (ORR) as determined by Independent Review Committee (IRC) for all treated patients (n=69). The results met the Company’s target guidance of 40-50% ORR. Interim safety and efficacy data from the MZL cohort will be presented in an oral presentation at the upcoming American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) annual meeting on April 1, 2019. Previously, in January 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for umbralisib for the treatment of adult patients with MZL who have received at least one prior anti-CD20 regimen, the same population currently being evaluated in the UNITY-NHL MZL cohort. We plan to discuss the results with the FDA regarding a potential new drug application (NDA) filing for accelerated approval. For the FL/SLL cohort, we are targeting topline data readout in second half-2019.

 
   ●
 Umbralisib plus Ublituximab UNITY-CLL Phase 3 Trial: UNITY-CLL is a global Phase 3 randomized controlled clinical trial comparing the U2 combination, to an active control arm of obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil in patients with both treatment naïve and relapsed or refractory CLL. The primary endpoint for this study is to demonstrate superiority in Progression Free Survival (PFS) for the U2 combination over the control arm to support the submission for full approval of the U2 combination in CLL. We cannot predict precisely when the PFS readout will occur, however our current estimate is PFS readout may be available by year-end 2019 or first half 2020. This trial is being conducted under Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) with FDA.

 
   ●
 Ublituximab Single Agent ULTIMATE I & II Trials: ULTIMATE I and ULTIMATE II are two independent Phase 3 trials. Each trial is a global, randomized, multi-center, double-blinded, double-dummy, active-controlled study comparing ublituximab to teriflunomide in subjects with relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis (RMS). The primary endpoint for each study is Annualized Relapse Rate (ARR) following 96 weeks of treatment over the control arm to support the submission for full approval of ublituximab in RMS. We are targeting topline data from this trial in mid-2020. These trials are being conducted under an SPA with the FDA.

 STRATEGY
  
  Our Strategy

 Our goal is to become a fully-integrated, B-cell targeted biopharmaceutical company capable of delivering multi-drug combination treatments for patients with diseases resulting from cancerous or aberrant B-cells. The key tenets of our strategy include the following:
 
   ●
 Successfully completing our current Phase 3 and registration-directed trials for umbralisib and ublituximab, including, UNITY-CLL, UNITY-NHL, and the ULTIMATE Phase 3 Program in MS;

   ●
 Rapidly gaining regulatory approval for umbralisib in NHL, umbralisib plus ublituximab (“U2”) in CLL, and ublituximab in MS;

   ●
 Efficiently and effectively prepare for commercial launch and build commercial capability to ensure, when approved, broad access to patients for the approved indications for umbralisib and ublituximab;

   ●
 Rapidly add ublituximab to umbralisib in NHL to advance U2 in NHL;

   ●
 Advance TG-1501, TG-1701, and TG-1801 through clinical development and define potential regulatory paths for these drug candidates both as single agents and in combination with umbralisib, ublituximab, and/or U2;

   ●
 Build upon the MS program to expand ublituximab into additional MS indications and other autoimmune diseases;

   ●
 Continue to expand our pipeline with mechanisms of importance to B-cell mediated diseases;

   ●
 Evaluate potential strategic collaborations to maximize the value of our programs and B-cell directed platform; and

   ●
 Maintain our “patient first” culture as we grow our business.


  Our Approach and Platform
 
 Our approach is to systematically identify targets that have proven activity in the treatment of B-cell diseases. Our preference is to identify targets for which there is human clinical proof of concept that the mechanism is active in B-cell diseases and then to identify drug candidates that effectively modulate the desired molecular target. We identify these drug candidates at academic centers of excellence or in development at biotech companies or pharmaceutical companies globally. Our current drug candidates were acquired through license agreements, collaborations, or joint ventures with biopharmaceutical companies located in the US, France, Switzerland, India, and China. This approach enables us to minimize target risk while looking for the best available drug candidates around the world. By focusing on B-cell diseases and targets with a known activity profile, we believe that we can quickly identify the patients most likely to respond, resulting in a more efficient development path with a greater likelihood of success. Importantly, since all our drug candidates are focused in one disease area, we can rapidly explore combination therapies, which we believe is essential to providing best outcomes for patients and holds the key to identifying cures for patients with B-cell diseases.
 
    Our approach is enabled by our clinical development platform which includes: 
   ●
 An internal team with a deep understanding of B-cell diseases and the treatment of patients; and

   ●
 An external clinical trials network composed of over 200 community and academic clinical trial sites globally, specializing in B-cell diseases.

 
  B-CELL DISEASES OVERVIEW
  
 B-cell mediated diseases comprise a constellation of disorders that result from cancerous B-cells or aberrant B-cells. In the case of cancerous B-cells, the most common forms of B-cell cancers or B-cell malignancies are non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). In the case of aberrant B-cells, many autoimmune diseases are believed to result from aberrant B-cell activity, including, Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), and Lupus.
  
 The Company’s current clinical programs are focused on CLL, MZL, FL, and RMS.
    
  Marginal Zone Lymphoma Overview
  
 MZL comprises a group of indolent (slow growing) B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) that begin forming in the marginal zone of lymphoid tissue. With an annual incidence of approximately 7,500 newly diagnosed patients in the United States, MZL is the third most common B-cell NHL, accounting for approximately eight percent of all NHL cases. MZL consists of three different subtypes: extranodal MZL of the mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), nodal marginal zone lymphoma (NMZL), and splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL).
 Follicular Lymphoma Overview
  
 FL is typically a slow-growing or indolent form of NHL which accounts for 20 to 30 percent of all NHL cases, with a prevalence of approximately 245,000 and an incidence of approximately 31,000 in the US, Japan, and 5 major EU markets. FL is usually not considered to be curable, but more of a chronic disease, with patients living for many years.

  Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Overview
  
 CLL is the most common type of adult leukemia, and in 2019, it is estimated there will be more than 20,000 new cases of CLL diagnosed in the United States. Although signs of CLL may disappear for a period of time after initial treatment, the disease is considered incurable and many people will require additional treatment due to the return of cancerous cells.
 Relapsing Forms of Multiple Sclerosis Overview
  
 Relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS), a chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) include people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and people with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) who continue to experience relapses. RRMS is the most common form of multiple sclerosis (MS) and is characterized by episodes of new or worsening signs or symptoms (relapses) followed by periods of recovery. It is estimated that nearly 1,000,000 people are living with MS in the United States and approximately 85 percent are initially diagnosed with RRMS. The majority of people who are diagnosed with RRMS will eventually transition to SPMS, in which they experience steadily worsening disability over time.
OUR PRODUCTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT  
 We have leveraged our B-cell platform to develop a robust drug pipeline of both targeted orally available, potent and selective small molecule kinase inhibitors and intravenously delivered “off-the-shelf” immunotherapies that leverage the patient’s own immune system to fight cancer. We currently own worldwide development and commercial rights, subject to certain limited geographical restrictions, to all of our pre-clinical and clinical programs. The following table summarizes our most advanced drug candidates as of February 28, 2019.

Clinical Drug Candidate (molecular target) | Initial Target Disease | Stage of Development (pivotal study) 
--------------------------------------------+------------------------------------+--------------------------------------
Ublituximab (anti-CD20/mAb) | Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia | Phase 3 trial (UNITY-CLL) 
Multiple Sclerosis | Phase 3 trials (ULTIMATE I and II)
Umbralisib (PI3K delta inhibitor) | Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia | Phase 3 trial (UNITY-CLL) 
Marginal Zone Lymphoma | Phase 2b trial (UNITY-NHL) 
Follicular Lymphoma | Phase 2b trial (UNITY-NHL) 
TG-1501 (anti-PDL1) | B-cell Cancers | Phase 1 trial

TG-1801 (anti-CD47/CD19) | B-cell Cancers | Phase 1 trial 

 Ublituximab Overview
  
 Ublituximab (also referred to as TG-1101) is a glycoengineered anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that targets a unique epitope on the CD20 antigen found on the surface of B-lymphocytes. We hold exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize ublituximab for all indications, except for the territories of France and Belgium for which an option to commercialize has been retained by LFB Biotechnologies, and South Korea and Southeast Asia which were licensed by us to Ildong Pharmaceutical Ltd in November 2012.
  
 Generally, anti-CD20 antibodies are believed to exert their B-cell depleting effects through three primary mechanisms: antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and direct or programmed cell death (DCD or PCD). Ublituximab has been specifically glycoengineered to enhance ADCC activity, which should enhance its ability to deplete B-cells and may improve its anti-cancer effects when compared to rituximab the leading anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, which had worldwide sales in 2018 of approximately $7 billion.
  
 ADCC is a mechanism that is dependent on interactions between the Fc region of the antibody and the FccR receptors on immune system effector cells, most notably the Fc−gammaR (CD16) receptor found on NK cells. These interactions trigger cells to release cytotoxic molecules and proteases resulting in B-cell death. Ublituximab is a next generation, type I chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody with a glycoengineered Fc region designed specifically to induce higher ADCC activity in comparison to rituximab. In pre-clinical (non-human) experiments, ublituximab has demonstrated an ability to enhance ADCC by >50x over rituximab, resulting in enhanced potency.
   Umbralisib Overview
  
 Umbralisib (also referred to as TGR-1202) is an oral, once daily inhibitor of PI3K delta inhibitor with nanomolar potency to the delta isoform and high selectivity over the alpha, beta, and gamma isoforms. Umbralisib also uniquely inhibits CK1-epsilon, which may allow it to overcome certain tolerability issues associated with first generation PI3K-delta inhibitors. Umbralisib has demonstrated activity in preclinical models of hematologic malignancies and in vitro on primary cells from patients with hematologic malignancies. The phosphoinositide-3-kinases (“PI3Ks”) are a family of enzymes involved in various cellular functions, including cell proliferation and survival, cell differentiation, intracellular trafficking, and immunity. There are four isoforms of PI3K (alpha, beta, delta, and gamma), of which the delta isoform is strongly expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin, and often implicated in B-cell related lymphomas.

     Additionally, in October 2016, a manuscript titled, "Silencing c-Myc Translation as a Therapeutic Strategy through Targeting PI3K Delta and CK1 Epsilon in Hematological Malignancies," was published online in the First Edition section of Blood, the Journal of the American Society of Hematology. The publication presents preclinical data describing the synergy of umbralisib with the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib and the unique effects of the combination to silence c-Myc in various preclinical lymphoma and myeloma models. Importantly, the manuscript for the first time reports on umbralisib’s unique complimentary mechanism of inhibiting the protein kinase casein kinase-1 epsilon (CK1e), which may contribute to what we believe is a differentiated safety profile of umbralisib over first generation PI3K delta inhibitors by supporting T regulatory cells, a part of the immune system necessary to protect against autoimmune mediated toxicities.
 
Early Clinical Development of Ublituximab and Umbralisib  
  Single Agent Ublituximab (TG-1101) in Relapsed/Refractory NHL & CLL
  
 Two single-agent, dose-escalation, Phase I studies were undertaken with ublituximab to establish an optimal dose in patients with NHL and CLL. The first was a two part first-in-human Phase I clinical trial completed in France in which ublituximab was evaluated in relapsed or refractory CLL. In 2012 a second single-agent Phase I study was undertaken in the US entitled "An Open Label Phase I/II Trial of the Efficacy and Safety of TG-1101 in Patients with B-cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma who have Relapsed or are Refractory After CD20 Directed Antibody Therapy." In July 2014, this trial completed enrollment of 35 patients, of which 12 patients were included in the dose escalation component and 23 patients in various expansion cohorts. All enrolled patients were relapsed or refractory to rituximab or a rituximab containing regimen, and in most cases multiple other lines of therapy. Dr. Owen O'Connor, Professor of Medicine and Director, Center for Lymphoid Malignancies at New York Presbyterian Columbia Medical Center was the Principal Investigator for the multi-center study. Data from this study was published in full in the British Journal of Haematology in February 2017. In both Phase 1 studies, single agent ublituximab was deemed well tolerated by treating investigators and displayed promising clinical activity in relapsed and refractory patients.
 Single Agent Ublituximab (TG-1101) in Relapsing Forms of Multiple Sclerosis
  
 In May 2016, we commenced our first study of ublituximab in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS), a chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). The study, entitled "A Placebo-Controlled Multi-Center Phase 2 Dose Finding Study of Ublituximab, a Third-Generation Anti-CD20 Monoclonal Antibody, in Patients with Relapsing Forms of Multiple Sclerosis," was led by Edward Fox, MD, PhD, Director of the Multiple Sclerosis Clinic of Central Texas and Clinical Associate Professor at the University of Texas Dell Medical School in Austin, TX. The primary objective of the study was to determine the optimal dosing regimen for ublituximab with a focus on accelerating infusion times. In addition to monitoring for safety and tolerability at each dosing cohort, B-cell depletion and established MS efficacy endpoints were also evaluated.
  
 In October 2018, final data from this Phase 2 study were presented at the 34th Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) meeting in Berlin, Germany. The presentation included final data on all 48 patients enrolled in the study through 48 weeks of treatment. Ublituximab was well tolerated across all patients including those receiving rapid infusions, as low as a one hour for the 450mg dose currently being studied in the Phase 3 ULTIMATE program and no study drug related discontinuations occurred. Median B cell depletion was >99% at the primary analysis point of Week 4 (n=48) and maintained at Week 24 and Week 48. Ublituximab also completely eliminated all (100%) T1 Gd-enhancing lesions at Week 24 and maintained complete elimination at Week 48 (n=46) and an Annualized Relapse Rate (ARR) of 0.07 was observed with 93% of subjects relapse free at Week 48.
  
  Single Agent Umbralisib (TGR-1202) in Patients with Relapsed/Refractory Hematologic Malignancies
  
 In January 2013, we initiated a Phase I, open label, multi-center, first-in-human clinical trial of umbralisib in patients with hematologic malignancies. The study entitled "A Phase I Dose Escalation Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of TGR-1202 in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Hematologic Malignancies," is being run in collaboration with the Sarah Cannon Research Institute in Nashville, TN with Howard “Skip” Burris, MD, Executive Director, Drug Development as the acting Study Chair. Enrollment was open to patients with relapsed or refractory NHL, CLL, and other select hematologic malignancies. As of February 2016, this study closed to enrollment.
  
 In February 2018, data from this first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial of umbralisib was published in The Lancet Oncology. The manuscript was titled, “Umbralisib, a novel PI3K and casein kinase-1 epsilon inhibitor, in relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoma: an open-label, phase 1, dose-escalation, first-in-human study.” The paper includes safety and efficacy information from 90 patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies, including patients with CLL and various forms of lymphoma treated with single agent umbralisib. In this study, the data showed that umbralisib was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile distinct from prior generation PI3K delta inhibitors.

  Additional Early Studies with Ublituximab (TG-1101) and/or Umbralisib (TGR-1202)
  
 In addition to the above Phase 1 trials for ublituximab and umbralisib, the following Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies, as well as an integrated analysis were conducted:
  
   ●
 Ublituximab in Combination with Umbralisib with/without ibrutinib or bendamustine for Relapsed/Refractory NHL & CLL— In November 2013, we initiated a multi-center, Phase I study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of ublituximab and umbralisib, (U2), for patients with relapsed and/or refractory CLL and NHL. The MD Anderson Cancer Center was the lead center for this clinical trial. Additional cohorts were added to this study to explore the triple therapy combination of U2 plus ibrutinib and the triple therapy combination of U2 plus bendamustine. Both U2 and the triplet combinations demonstrated acceptable levels of tolerability with promising activity. Enrollment in all cohorts is now closed and patients continued to be followed for safety and efficacy. Data highlights from each cohort include the following:

 
   ●
 U2: In December 2015 we presented the results from the U2 portion of this trial at the 57th American Society of Hematology (ASH) annual meeting, Abstract Number 1538. The presentation included data from patients with relapsed and refractory NHL and CLL treated with U2. The combination was well tolerated in the 71 patients evaluable for safety at all dose levels up through 1200mg. This was a heavily pretreated population with high-risk features, including 58% refractory to last treatment with multiple previous lines of rituximab-based therapy. Notably, the only Grade 3/4 adverse event occurring in > 5% of patients was neutropenia and of the 71 patients available for safety, only 6 patients (8%) discontinued due to an umbralisib related event. Additionally, 26 patients had been on U2 for 6+ months, with no events of colitis reported as of the date of publication.

  ●
 Efficacy data was presented on patients treated at the higher doses of umbralisib (1200mg of the original formulation and 600mg or greater of the micronized formulation). 80% (8 of 10) ORR was observed in patients with CLL/SLL, including 1 complete response (CR) and 7 partial responses (PRs). Notably, 75% of CLL patients had high-risk cytogenetics (17p and/or 11q del). 71% (12 of 17) ORR was observed in heavily pretreated patients with indolent NHL (FL & MZL), including 4 CRs (24%) and 8 PRs, with 4 of the remaining 5 patients achieving stable disease.

   
  ●
 U2 plus Bendamustine: In December 2018, updated data for the U2 plus bendamustine cohort was presented at the 60th ASH Annual Meeting. Overall, the U2 plus bendamustine combination was well tolerated and highly active in patients with advanced indolent and aggressive NHL, including those not eligible for HD/SCT or CD19 CART therapy. Efficacy highlights from this poster included an 85% (11 of 13) ORR including a 54% CR rate in patients with relapsed or refractory FL.

 
  ●
 U2 plus Ibrutinib: In January 2019, we announced the publication of results from the U2 plus ibrutinib cohort in The Lancet Haematology. Safety data was available from 46 patients and the triple combination of ublituximab, umbralisib, and ibrutinib was well tolerated with a manageable adverse event profile, and no maximum tolerated dose achieved for the combination. Efficacy data was available from 44 patients and showed the U2 plus ibrutinib combination to be highly active. The ORR amongst all evaluable patients was 84%, with 100% (22 of 22) of patients with CLL/SLL achieving a response, including 36% achieving a CR. Among patients with NHL, 68% (15 of 22) achieved a response, including a 71% ORR in FL (n=7), a 100% ORR in MZL (n=3), and a 100% ORR in MCL (n=6).

 
  ●
 Umbralisib as a single agent in CLL patients who are intolerant to prior BTK inhibitor or PI3K delta inhibitor therapy— In June 2018, at the 23rd Congress of the European Hematology Association (EHA), data was presented from 47 patients with CLL who were intolerant to prior BTK or PI3K delta inhibitor therapy who were then treated with single agent umbralisib. Umbralisib demonstrated a favorable safety profile with only 13% of patients discontinuing due to an adverse event, of which only one patient discontinued due to a recurrent adverse event (AE) also experienced with prior kinase inhibitor therapy. As of the data presentation, nearly half of the patients enrolled had been on umbralisib for a duration longer than their prior kinase inhibitor. The median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) has not been reached with a median follow-up of 9.5 months. Enrollment is now closed with patients continuing to be followed.

 
  ●
 Umbralisib Long-term Follow-up Integrated Analysis in Patients with Relapsed/Refractory Hematologic Malignancies— In December 2017, at the 59th ASH Annual Meeting, the Company presented integrated long-term follow-up data from 347 patients exposed to umbralisib across 5 studies, which continued to demonstrate high response rates in CLL, and FL coupled with a favorable safety profile distinct from other PI3K delta inhibitors. In June 2018, an update on the data was presented at the 23rd Congress of the European Hematology Association (EHA). The presentation included data pooled from 4 completed or ongoing Phase 1 or 2 studies containing umbralisib, focusing on 177 patients who have been on daily umbralisib for a minimum of 6 months. Patients were heavily pretreated, with 45% of patients having seen 3 or more prior lines of therapy. Umbralisib continued to exhibit a differentiated safety profile compared to prior generation PI3K delta inhibitors. Serious adverse events occurring in >1% of patients after 6 months on therapy were limited to pneumonia (3%), diarrhea (2%), and cellulitis (2%) with only 2% of patients discontinuing umbralisib as a result of diarrhea/colitis after being on umbralisib for more than 6 months.

  ●
 Phase 2 trial of Ublituximab plus Ibrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL and Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)— In December 2013, we initiated a multi-center Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of ublituximab and ibrutinib for patients with CLL and MCL. Jeff P. Sharman, MD, Medical Director, Hematology Research, US Oncology Network, was the Study Chair. This trial has completed enrollment. Final data from the MCL cohort of this study was presented at the 57th ASH meeting held in December 2015, with data from the CLL cohort published in the British Journal of Haematology in December 2016. The combination displayed marked clinical activity, reporting an 88% (35/41) response rate in patients with CLL, a 95% (19/21) response rate in those CLL patients with high-risk cytogenetics, and an 87% (13/15) response rate in patients with MCL. The data from the CLL cohort of this study supported the Phase 3 GENUINE study evaluating ublituximab plus ibrutinib in CLL patients with high-risk cytogenetics.

 
  ●
 Phase 2 trial of Umbralisib plus Ibrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL and MCL— In December 2018, we announced the publication of results from the multicenter Phase 1/1b trial of umbralisib in combination with ibrutinib, the oral Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, in Lancet Haematology. This investigator-initiated trial was conducted at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and four additional centers across the USA in collaboration with the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Blood Cancer Research Partnership with funding by TG Therapeutics. The publication includes safety and efficacy information from a total of 42 relapsed or refractory patients, 21 with CLL and 21 with MCL. In this study, the combination of umbralisib and ibrutinib was well tolerated and consistent with the additive toxicity profile of the two drugs individually. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed, and the maximum-tolerated dose of umbralisib when combined with ibrutinib was not reached. The recommended phase 2 dose of umbralisib when given in combination with ibrutinib was 800 mg once daily. Importantly, serious immune-mediated toxicities were not observed with this combination, as had previously been reported with combinations of different agents targeting this pathway, with only one case of transient Grade 3 transaminitis and no Grade 3/4 colitis or pneumonitis. The combination of umbralisib and ibrutinib was also clinically active, with 90% of relapsed/refractory CLL patients achieving an overall response (n=19), of which 62% (n=13) achieved a partial response or partial response with lymphocytosis, and 29% (n=6) achieved a complete response. Of the 21 patients treated with MCL, 67% (n=14) achieved an overall response, of which 48% (n=10) achieved a partial response and 19% (n=4) achieved a complete response. 

 
  ●
 Additional early combination studies utilizing umbralisib with approved agents— Umbralisib has been evaluated in combination with the anti-CD30 antibody drug conjugate, brentuximab vedotin, in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin’s lymphoma and in combination with the JAK inhibitor, ruxolitinib, in patients with Myelofibrosis or Polycythemia Vera. Additional investigator sponsored trials are also underway which are combining umbralisib and or the U2 combination with other approved agents for the treatment of B-cell malignancies.

  
Phase 3 and Registration-Directed Clinical Trials for Ublituximab and Umbralisib  
 The company has initiated and enrolled several Phase 3 and registration-directed Phase 2b clinical trials (ie, clinical trials that may support a marketing application for approval). The following are the current Phase 3 trials and registration-directed Phase 2b clinical trials in the order of expected top-line data:
  
  The UNITY-NHL Trial—Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL) and Follicular Lymphoma (FL)/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL) Cohorts (Umbralisib single agent)
  
 The UNITY-NHL study is a broad Phase 2b multiple cohort trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of umbralisib monotherapy and in combination with ublituximab in previously treated subjects with NHL. In 2017, the UNITY-NHL study began enrolling a cohort of patients with FL/SLL and an additional cohort of patients with MZL. These cohorts of the trial are being led by Nathan H. Fowler, MD, Associate Professor, Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. The primary objective of these cohorts of the study are to assess the efficacy of umbralisib single agent as measured by ORR.
  
 For the FL/SLL cohort, adult patients were enrolled who had two prior lines of therapy that included an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody and an alkylating agent. This cohort is fully enrolled with approximately 125 patients and top-line data are expected in second half 2019.
  
 For the MZL cohort, adult patients were enrolled who had one prior line of therapy that included an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. On February 28, 2019 we announced that the MZL cohort of the UNITY-NHL Phase 2b pivotal trial evaluating umbralisib monotherapy met the primary endpoint of Overall Response Rate (ORR) as determined by Independent Review Committee (IRC) for all treated patients (n=69). The results met the Company’s target guidance of 40-50% ORR. Interim safety and efficacy data from this study will be presented in an oral presentation at the upcoming American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) annual meeting on April 1, 2019 and full data from this study are expected to be presented at a medical meeting later this year. We plan to discuss the results with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding a potential new drug application (NDA) filing for accelerated approval.
 
 The multicenter, open-label, UNITY-NHL Phase 2b study - MZL cohort was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of single agent umbralisib in patients with MZL who have received at least one prior anti-CD20 regimen. The primary endpoint is ORR as determined by IRC assessment. The primary analysis of ORR will be conducted once all treated patients have had at least 9 cycles (Cycle = 28 days) of follow-up. Secondary endpoints include safety, duration of response, and progression-free survival (PFS).

  The positive ORR outcome announced in February 2019 was based on all 69 enrolled and treated patients, however at the time all patients had not yet been followed for a minimum of 9 cycles as required for the primary analysis of ORR. Accordingly, the study is on-going and patients with benefit on therapy (stable disease or in response) remain on study. Safety data are currently being analyzed.
 
 In January 2019, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for umbralisib for the treatment of adult patients with MZL who have received at least one prior anti-CD20 regimen. The BTD was based on interim data from the MZL cohort of the UNITY-NHL trial.
  
 There are additional exploratory cohorts of the UNITY-NHL trial focused on Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) and Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL). Each cohort of the UNITY-NHL trial including, MZL, FL/SLL, DLBCL, and MCL, is enrolled to and evaluated independently.

  The UNITY-CLL Trial—Combination of Ublituximab (TG-1101) plus Umbralisib (TGR-1202) in patients with Front-line or Relapsed/Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
 
 In September 2015, we reached an agreement with the FDA regarding a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) on the design, endpoints and statistical analysis approach of a Phase 3 clinical trial, UNITY-CLL, for the proprietary combination of ublituximab plus umbralisib, for the treatment of CLL. The SPA provides agreement that the Phase 3 trial design adequately addresses objectives that, if met, would support the regulatory submission for drug approval of both ublituximab and umbralisib in combination.
  
 The Phase 3 trial, called the UNITY-CLL trial, is a randomized controlled clinical trial that includes two key objectives: first, to demonstrate contribution of each agent in the ublituximab plus umbralisib regimen (the combination sometimes referred to as "U2"), and second, to demonstrate superiority in PFS over the standard of care to support the submission for full approval of the combination. The study randomized patients into four treatment arms: ublituximab plus umbralisib, ublituximab alone, umbralisib alone, and an active control arm of obinutuzumab + chlorambucil. The UNITY-CLL trial is being led by John Gribben, MD, professor of Medical Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, United Kingdom. The study enrolled over 600 patients across the four treatment arms with approximately 420 patients in the U2 and the active control arm combined. Enrollment completed in October 2017.
  
 In May 2017, an early interim analysis was conducted to assess contribution of each single agent in the ublituximab plus umbralisib combination regimen, which allowed for the early termination of both single agent arms. A second interim analysis was planned to evaluate ORR to support accelerated approval when all patients in the U2 arm and the active control arm had at least 6 months of follow-up. In September 2018, we announced that the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (“DSMB”) reviewed ongoing data from the trial and advised us that the second interim analysis of ORR could not be conducted at that time as the data were not sufficiently mature to conduct the analysis. Given the uncertainty surrounding the timing and outcome of the ORR analysis, as well as the significant regulatory hurdles associated with accelerated approval in CLL, we are no longer planning to seek accelerated approval for U2 in CLL based on ORR. The Company remains blinded to all efficacy data and the trial continues to be conducted under SPA agreement with the FDA. We await the results for the primary endpoint for the study, PFS, to seek full approval for U2 in patients with CLL, if the study is positive. Importantly, an application based on PFS is expected to support full approval versus accelerated approval, which is a conditional approval.
  
 Additionally, in September 2018, the DSMB reviewed safety data from over 600 patients, including over 300 patients treated with umbralisib either alone or in combination with ublituximab, of which approximately 60% were treatment naïve. After review of the data, the DSMB identified no safety concerns and recommended the trial continue without modification.
 
The GENUINE Trial— Ublituximab + Ibrutinib in patients with high risk Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia  
 The GENUINE trial is a randomized controlled clinical trial in patients with previously treated CLL with specific high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities, with patients randomized to receive either ublituximab plus ibrutinib or ibrutinib alone. Due to enrollment challenges associated with this study, in October 2016, we announced revisions to the design of the GENUINE study to accelerate its completion. Initially the study was being conducted pursuant to an SPA with the FDA, and was designed to enroll approximately 330 patients, with a two-part analysis of both ORR and PFS. The trial as amended in October 2016 removed PFS as a co-primary endpoint leaving ORR as the sole primary endpoint. The target number of patients was also reduced to 120 patients. The SPA was terminated at the time the changes were implemented.
  
 In March 2017, we reported positive top-line data from the GENUINE study and in June 2017, the results were presented by Dr. Jeff P. Sharman, Medical Director, Hematology Research, US Oncology in an oral session during the 53rd American Society of Clinical Oncology ("ASCO") Annual Meeting in Chicago, IL. We had hoped to use the ORR results from the GENUINE trial to file for accelerated approval for the combination of ublituximab plus ibrutinib. In October of 2017, we announced the results of a meeting with the FDA related to the potential accelerated approval application. The FDA had expressed concern that an intervening approval for the treatment of relapsed or refractory CLL could, as available therapy, have the effect of blocking our accelerated approval application. In June 2018, venetoclax received full approval for the treatment of relapsed or refractory CLL, the same indication for which we planned to file accelerated approval. While we do believe under the FDA guidance related to accelerated approval that there are benefits of ublituximab plus ibrutinib over presently available therapies that could support approval, we have decided at this time to not pursue the filing of the results from the GENUINE trial to support accelerated approval. We continue to follow patients in the GENUINE study for safety and efficacy including Overall Response Rate, Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) and PFS.

   The ULTIMATE I and ULTIMATE II Phase 3 Clinical Trials—Single Agent Ublituximab in relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis
  
 In August 2017, we reached an agreement with the FDA regarding an SPA on the design of two Phase 3 clinical trials for ublituximab, referred to as the ULTIMATE I and ULTIMATE II trials, for the treatment of relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis (RMS). The SPA provides agreement that the two Phase 3 trial designs adequately address objectives that, if met, would support the regulatory submission for approval of ublituximab in RMS. Each trial is a global, randomized, multi-center, double-blinded, double-dummy, active-controlled study comparing ublituximab to teriflunomide in subjects with RMS. The primary endpoint for each study is Annualized Relapse Rate (ARR) following 96 weeks of treatment. Each trial was designed to enroll approximately 440 subjects, randomized in a 1:1 ratio.  This trial is being led by Lawrence Steinman, MD, George A. Zimmermann Professor and Professor of Pediatrics, Neurology and Neurological Sciences at Stanford University.
  
 In August 2018, we announced that target enrollment into the ULTIMATE I and II trials had been achieved, and that enrollment would continue into September 2018 to allow identified patients to participate in the study. At completion of full enrollment in October of 2018, approximately 1,100 subjects were enrolled in both studies combined.
         TG-1501 (anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody) Overview  
 TG-1501 is a fully human monoclonal antibody of IgG1 subtype that binds to Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) and blocks its interactions with PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. Cancer cells elude anti-tumor immunity through multiple mechanisms, including upregulated expression of ligands for inhibitory immune checkpoint receptors. Signals from PD-L1 on tumor cells and in the tumor microenvironment help those tumors avoid immune attack and elimination by preventing activation of tumor specific effector T-cells. Anti-PD-L1 antibodies are designed to block that signal, permitting effector T-cells to attack the cancer. Clinical studies have shown that blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway by monoclonal antibodies can enhance the immune response and result in anti-tumor activity.
 
 Preclinically, it has been shown that the effects of anti-PD-L1 intervention can be enhanced by utilizing other mechanisms targeting the tumor microenvironment. Combining immunotherapies like anti-PD-L1, that counters the tumor's immune-evading defense system with other anti-cancer agents such as ublituximab or umbralisib may better engage the body's own immune system to help fight cancer.
 
 A comprehensive array of in vitro biochemical and cellular assays was established to characterize the binding and the functional activities of TG-1501. The in vitro data demonstrated that the affinity, PD-L1 binding capability, relative ability to inhibit PD-1/PDL-1 interactions, and functional activity of TG-1501 in cellular assays are comparable to those of atezolizumab, durvalumab and avelumab - the currently approved products sharing the same mechanism of action.
 
 TG-1501 is currently being evaluated in an ongoing study (Study CK-301-101: NCT03212404), enrolling patients with select solid tumors, being conducted by our licensor. In the dose escalation portion of this trial, doses ranging from 200mg to 800mg were tested with no dose-limiting toxicities observed and no maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was achieved; therefore, a fixed dose of 800 mg was the selected starting dose of TG-1501 for patients with hematologic malignancies.
 
 In December 2018, the FDA approved an IND for TG-1501 and a Phase 1 study in subjects with select subtypes of lymphoma is expected to commence in Q1 2019. After characterizing the safety profile of TG-1501 as monotherapy in hematological malignancies, the study may evaluate TG-1501 in combination with other therapies, including ublituximab and/or umbralisib. Based on our rapidly evolving understanding of the pathobiology of lymphoma subtypes, we envision further combinations with other immunotherapies in the future.
 
  TG-1701 (BTK inhibitor) Overview
  
 TG-1701 is a novel, orally available and covalently-bound Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor that exhibits superior selectivity to BTK compared to ibrutinib in in vitro kinase screening.
  
 B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling is crucial for normal B-cell development and supports the survival and growth of malignant B-cells in patients with B-cell leukemias or lymphomas. Targeting BTK, an essential element of BCR signaling pathway which regulates the survival, activation, proliferation, and differentiation of B lymphocytes, has shown remarkable efficacy with an acceptable safety profile in B-cell malignancies.       
 In June 2018, pre-clinical data for TG-1701 demonstrating favorable pharmacologic properties was presented at the 23rd Congress of the European Hematology Association (EHA) in Stockholm, Sweden. In vitro pharmacology studies have revealed that TG-1701 inhibited BTK with greater than 10-fold selectivity as measured by IC50 on the kinase activities of EGFR, ITK, TXK, JAK3, HER2 and HER4. In vivo pharmacology studies showed that TG-1701 significantly inhibited the growth of xenograft lymphoid tumors including OCI-LY-10 and DOHH-2 in nude mice.
 
 We are currently evaluating TG-1701 in a Phase 1, multi-center, dose-escalation clinical trial in patients with B-cell malignancies. This trial is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TG-1701 in adults with B-cell malignancies and determine the recommended Phase 2 dose. Key secondary objectives include evaluation of pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and preliminary anticancer activity.

  TG-1801 (anti-CD47/anti-CD19 bispecific monoclonal antibody) Overview
  
     TG-1801 is a first-in-class, bispecific CD47 and CD19 antibody. It is the first therapy to target both CD19, a B-cell specific market widely express across B-cell malignancies, and CD47, the "don’t eat me" signal used by both healthy and tumor cells to evade macrophage mediated phagocytosis. CD47 is expressed ubiquitously on normal cells, including red blood cells and platelets. CD19 is a specific B-cell marker, expressed early during pre-B cell ontogeny and until terminal differentiation into early plasma cells. The majority of B-cell lineage malignancies (more than 90%) express CD19, including NHL, CLL and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Tumor B-cells that have lost the expression of CD20 after anti-CD20 mAb therapy, have been found to maintain the expression of CD19, making CD19 an attractive target in the treatment of B cell malignancies. By co-targeting both CD47 and CD19, TG-1801 has the potential to overcome the limitations of existing CD47 targeted therapies by avoiding the side effects caused by indiscriminate blockade of CD47 on healthy cells. In addition to potentially enhancing tolerability, the co-targeting of CD19 by TG-1801 may provide a secondary mechanism of direct anti-tumor activity through the engagement of effector cells and induction of antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).
     
 TG-1801 binds to human CD19 with significantly higher affinity than towards CD47. This difference between its affinity to CD19 and CD47 allows TG-1801 to bind and selectively block CD47 on CD19+ B-cells but not on CD19- red blood cells or platelets in human peripheral blood.
  
  In in vitro assays, TG-1801 induces antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of malignant tumor B-cell lines and primary tumor B-cells from patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and numerous subtypes of NHL.


 In in vivo mouse tumor models, treatment with TG-1801 inhibited tumor growth in Raji cell subcutaneous xenograft model, NALM-6 cell disseminated tumor model, and patient-derived xenograft models, including primary tumor cells from patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and B-ALL. In addition, the combination of rituximab and TG-1801 demonstrated enhanced activity over TG-1801 monotherapy.
 
 In summary, TG-1801 demonstrates anti-tumor activity in both in vitro assays (ADCP and ADCC) and in vivo animal tumor models.
 
 In the first quarter of 2019 we commenced, a Phase 1 first-in-human, dose-escalation study of TG-1801. This study will evaluate escalating doses of TG-1801 in patients with B-Cell lymphoma. The primary objective of the study is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose and to characterize the safety profile of TG-1801. Key secondary objectives are to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of TG-1801 and its preliminary anticancer activity.
 
  Preclinical Programs
  
     In addition to our clinical programs, we currently have licensed preclinical programs for BET (TG-1601), IRAK4, and GITR.
  
  COSTS AND TIME TO COMPLETE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
  
 The information below provides estimates regarding the costs associated with the completion of the current development phase and our current estimated range of the time that will be necessary to complete that development phase for our key pipeline products. We also direct your attention to the risk factors which could significantly affect our ability to meet these cost and time estimates found in this report in Item 1A under the heading “Risks Related to the Company’s Business and Industry.” 

Product Candidate | Target Indication | Development Status | Completion of Phase | Estimated Cost to Complete Phase
--------------------------+------------------------------------------------+--------------------+---------------------+---------------------------------
Ublituximab & Umbralisib | CLL patients | Phase III | 2019 | Approximately $5 million 
Umbralisib +/-Ublituximab | Relapsed/refractory NHL patients | Phase IIb | 2019* | Approximately $5 million 
Ublituximab | In Relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis (RMS) | Phase III | 2020 | Approximately $35 million 


 *Completion of phase for this study indicates completion of portion of study, which, if successful, would support an accelerated approval
  
 Completion dates and costs in the above table are estimates due to the uncertainties associated with clinical trials and the related requirements of development. In the cases where the requirements for clinical trials and development programs have not been fully defined, or are dependent on the success of other trials, we cannot estimate trial completion or cost with any certainty. The actual spending on each trial during the year is also dependent on funding. We therefore direct your attention to Item 7 under the heading “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PATENTS
  
  General
  
 Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world.
  
 We also depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. This knowledge, trade secrets, proprietary information and experience we call “know-how.” To help protect our proprietary know-how which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we require all employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements which prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.

 Patents and other proprietary rights are crucial to the development of our business. We will be able to protect our proprietary technologies from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents, supported by regulatory exclusivity or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. We have a number of patents and patent applications related to our compounds and other technology, but we cannot guarantee the scope of protection of the issued patents, or that such patents will survive a validity or enforceability challenge, or that any of the pending patent applications will issue as patents.
  
 Generally, patent applications in the U.S. are maintained in secrecy for a period of 18 months or more. Since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we are not certain that we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file those patent applications. The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Therefore, we cannot predict the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents, or their enforceability. To date, there has been no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents. Third parties or competitors may challenge or circumvent our patents or patent applications, if issued. If our competitors prepare and file patent applications in the U.S. that claim technology also claimed by us, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that before we commercialize any of our products, any related patent may expire or remain in existence for only a short period following commercialization, thus reducing any advantage of the patent. However, the life of a patent covering a product that has been subject to regulatory approval may have the ability to be extended through the patent restoration program, although any such extension could still be minimal. If a patent is issued to a third party containing one or more preclusive or conflicting claims, and those claims are ultimately determined to be valid and enforceable, we may be required to obtain a license under such patent or to develop or obtain alternative technology. In the event of litigation involving a third party claim, an adverse outcome in the litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to such third party, require us to seek a license for the disputed rights from such third party, and/or require us to cease use of the technology. Further, our breach of an existing license or failure to obtain a license to technology required to commercialize our products may seriously harm our business. We also may need to commence litigation to enforce any patents issued to us or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. Litigation would involve substantial costs.
  
 We file patent applications directed to our drug candidates in an effort to establish intellectual property positions regarding these new chemical entities as well as uses of these new chemical entities in the treatment of diseases. We also file patent applications directed to novel combinations of our drugs together and with drugs developed by others. The intellectual property portfolios for our most advanced drug candidates as of February 28, 2018 are summarized below. Each of these portfolios contain pending patent applications covering our drug candidates and uses and combinations of the drug candidates, prosecution has just begun or is in progress. Prosecution is a lengthy process, during which the scope of the claims initially submitted for examination by the USPTO often significantly narrowed by the time they issue, if they issue at all. We expect this to be the case with respect to our pending patent applications referred to below.
 
 Additionally, because the date for any potential regulatory approval is currently unknown we cannot predict the expected expiration date, and it is possible that the life of these patents following regulatory approval could be minimal.
  
  Ublituximab
  
 Pursuant to our license for ublituximab with LFB Biotechnologies, GTC Biotherapeutics, and LFB/GTC LLC, we have the exclusive commercial rights to a series of patents and patent applications in the U.S. and in multiple countries around the world, as well as a non-exclusive license to additional background patent rights. These patents and patent protections include composition of matter patents relating to the structure and mechanism of action for ublituximab as well as method of use patents which cover use of ublituximab in combination with various agents and for various therapeutic indications.
  

  
11


 
 
 The composition of matter patent for ublituximab has been issued in the U.S. and Europe, which affords patent protection until 2029 in the U.S. and 2025 in Europe, exclusive of patent term extensions. We also have a method of use patent on the combination of umbralisib and ublituximab which has been issued in the U.S., EU, and Japan, and is pending in other territories globally. Additionally, we have numerous granted patents and pending patent applications outside the U.S. which include claims directed to the composition of matter and methods of treatment with ublituximab in various settings.
  
  Umbralisib
  
 Pursuant to our license for umbralisib with Rhizen, we have the exclusive commercial rights to a series of patent applications in the U.S. and abroad. The patent applications include composition of matter patents relating to the structure, mechanism of action, and formulation for umbralisib as well as method of use patents which cover use of umbralisib in combination with various agents and for various therapeutic indications. Our composition of matter patent for umbralisib has been issued in the U.S. and Europe, which affords patent protection until 2033, exclusive of patent term extensions. We also have a method of use patent on the combination of umbralisib and ublituximab which has been issued in the U.S., EU, and Japan, and is pending in other territories globally. All other patent applications currently filed for umbralisib are currently pending. Because the dates for any potential regulatory approval are currently unknown we cannot predict the expected expiration date, and it is possible that the life of these patents following regulatory approval could be minimal.
  
  TG-1501 (anti-PDL1 monoclonal antibody)
  
 Pursuant to our Global Collaboration with Checkpoint Therapeutics, we have the exclusive commercial rights in the treatment of hematological cancers and autoimmune diseases to a series of patent applications pending in the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe, Israel and Korea. Any patents maturing from these pending applications will expire no sooner than October 2033. 
  
  TG-1701 (BTK inhibitor)
  
 Pursuant to our license agreement with Jiangsu Hengrui, we have the exclusive commercial rights to a patent family which covers the composition of matter and proposed methods of use for various therapeutic indications. All patent applications currently filed for the BTK program are currently pending. Any patents maturing from these pending applications will expire no sooner than October 2034.
  
  TG-1801 (anti-CD47/anti-CD19 bispecific antibody)
 
 Pursuant to our joint venture and license option agreement with Novimmune, we have the exclusive commercial rights to a series of global patent applications, all of which are currently pending. Any patents maturing from these pending applications will expire no sooner than December 2032. 
  
  Limitations on Patent Rights and Trade Secrets
  
 The patent rights that we own or have licensed relating to our product candidates are limited in ways that may affect our ability to exclude third parties from competing against us if we obtain regulatory approval to market these product candidates. See “Item 1A – Risk Factors -- Risks Related to the Company’s Intellectual Property.” In addition, the limited patent protection may adversely affect the value of our product candidates and may inhibit our ability to obtain a corporate partner at terms acceptable to us, if at all.
  
 Proof of direct infringement by a competitor for method of use patents can prove difficult because the competitors making and marketing a product typically do not engage in the patented use. Additionally, proof that a competitor contributes to or induces infringement of a patented method of use by another can also prove difficult because an off-label use of a product could prohibit a finding of contributory infringement and inducement of infringement requires proof of intent by the competitor.
  
 Moreover, physicians may prescribe such a competitive identical product for indications other than the one for which the product has been approved, or off-label indications, that are covered by the applicable patents. Although such off-label prescriptions may directly infringe or contribute to or induce infringement of method of use patents, such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute.
  
 In addition, while we have and plan to continue to enter into confidentiality agreements designed to protect our trade secrets, know-how and proprietary information and to grant us ownership of inventions that are developed by individuals in connection with their relationship with us, these agreements may not, however, provide protection for our trade secrets, know-how and proprietary information in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information.

Orphan Drug Designation   
    In addition to patent protection, we may utilize orphan drug regulations or other provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, as amended, or FDCA, to provide market exclusivity for certain of our drug candidates. Orphan drug regulations provide incentives to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to develop and manufacture drugs for the treatment of rare diseases, currently defined as diseases that exist in fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or, diseases that affect more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. but that the sponsor does not realistically anticipate will generate a net profit. Under these provisions, a manufacturer of a designated orphan-drug can seek tax benefits, and the holder of the first FDA approval of a designated orphan product will be granted a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity for such FDA-approved orphan product.
 
 Pursuant to these regulations, ublituximab has received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for the treatment of MZL (Nodal and Extranodal) in September 2013, for the treatment of CLL in August of 2010, and Orphan Drug Designation by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) for the treatment of CLL in November of 2009.
  
 We also obtained Orphan Drug Designation for umbralisib as monotherapy for the treatment of CLL in August 2016, and in January 2017, we announced that the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation covering the combination of ublituximab and umbralisib for the treatment of patients with CLL and DLBCL. We believe that ublituximab and umbralisib, as well as our other pipeline products may be eligible for additional Orphan Drug Designations; however, we cannot assure you that ublituximab, umbralisib, or any other drug candidates we may acquire or in-license, will obtain such Orphan Drug Designations or that we will be the first to receive FDA approval for any drug candidates that do obtain Orphan Drug Designation so as to be eligible for market exclusivity protection.
  
  U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
  
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
 
 Marketing exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the pre-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Orphan drug exclusivity, as described below, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
 
 Upon FDA approval, we believe that ublituximab and umbralisib each would qualify as a New Chemical Entity, or NCE, which provides for five years of exclusivity following approval as discussed above.

  LICENSING AGREEMENTS AND COLLABORATIONS
  
 We have formed strategic alliances with a number of companies for the manufacture and commercialization of our products. Our current key strategic alliances are discussed below.
 Ublituximab
  
  LFB Biotechnologies S.A.S, GTC Biotherapeutics, LFB/GTC LLC.
  
 In January 2012, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with LFB Biotechnologies, GTC Biotherapeutics, and LFB/GTC LLC, all wholly-owned subsidiaries of LFB Group, relating to the development of ublituximab. Under the license agreement, we have acquired the exclusive worldwide rights (exclusive of France/Belgium) for the development and commercialization of ublituximab. To date, we have made no payments to LFB Group under the license agreement, excluding an upfront equity payment. LFB Group is eligible to receive payments of up to an aggregate of approximately $31.0 million upon our successful achievement of certain clinical development, regulatory and sales milestones, in addition to royalty payments on net sales of ublituximab at a royalty rate that escalates from mid-single digits to high-single digits. The license will terminate on a country by country basis upon the expiration of the last licensed patent right or 15 years after the first commercial sale of a product in such country, unless the agreement is earlier terminated (i) by LFB if the Company challenges any of the licensed patent rights, (ii) by either party due to a breach of the agreement, or (iii) by either party in the event of the insolvency of the other party.
 Ildong Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.
  
 In November 2012, we entered into an exclusive (within the territory) sublicense agreement with Ildong relating to the development and commercialization of ublituximab in South Korea and Southeast Asia. Under the terms of the sublicense agreement, Ildong has been granted a royalty bearing, exclusive right, including the right to grant sublicenses, to develop and commercialize ublituximab in South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam, and Myanmar. To date, we have received $2 million in the form of an upfront payment from Ildong and are eligible to receive sales-based milestone payments up to an aggregate of $5 million and royalty payments on net sales of ublituximab at a royalty rate that escalates from mid-teens to high-teens upon approval in South Korea and/or Southeast Asia. The license will terminate on a country by country basis upon the expiration of the last licensed patent right or 15 years after the first commercial sale of a product in such country, unless the agreement is earlier terminated (i) by Ildong if the Company challenges any of the licensed patent rights, (ii) by either party due to a breach of the agreement, or (iii) by either party in the event of the insolvency of the other party.
 Umbralisib
   
 In September 2014, we exercised our option to license the global rights to umbralisib, thereby entering into an exclusive licensing agreement (the “Umbralisib License”) with Rhizen Pharmaceuticals, S A (“Rhizen”) for the development and commercialization of umbralisib. Prior to this, we had been jointly developing umbralisib in a 50:50 joint venture with Rhizen.
  
 Under the terms of the Umbralisib License, Rhizen received a $4.0 million cash payment and 371,530 shares of our common stock as an upfront license fee. With respect to umbralisib, Rhizen will be eligible to receive regulatory filing, approval and sales based milestone payments in the aggregate of approximately $175 million, a small portion of which will be payable on the first New Drug Application (NDA) filing and the remainder on approval in multiple jurisdictions for up to two oncology indications and one non-oncology indication and attaining certain sales milestones. In addition, if umbralisib is co-formulated with another drug to create a new product (a "New Product"), Rhizen will be eligible to receive similar regulatory approval and sales-based milestone payments for such New Product. Additionally, Rhizen will be entitled to tiered royalties that escalate from high single digits to low double digits on our future net sales of umbralisib and any New Product. In lieu of sales milestones and royalties on net sales, Rhizen shall also be eligible to participate in sublicensing revenue, if any, based on a percentage that decreases as a function of the number of patients treated in clinical trials following the exercise of the license option. Rhizen will retain global manufacturing rights to umbralisib, provided that they are price competitive with alternative manufacturers. The license will terminate on a country by country basis upon the expiration of the last licensed patent right or any other exclusivity right in such country, unless the agreement is earlier terminated (i) by us for any reason, (ii) by either party due to a breach of the agreement.
  
  TG-1501 (anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody)
  
 In March 2015, we entered into a Global Collaboration (the “Collaboration”) with Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc. (“Checkpoint”) for the development and commercialization of Checkpoint’s anti-PD-L1 and anti-GITR antibody research programs in the field of hematological malignancies with an option to acquire rights in autoimmune diseases. These antibodies were generated at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (Dana-Farber). Under the terms of the Collaboration, we made an up-front payment of $500,000, will make development and sales-based milestone payments up to an aggregate of $164 million, and will pay a tiered single digit royalty on net sales. The royalty term will terminate on a country by country basis upon the later of (i) ten years after the first commercial sale of any applicable licensed product in such country, or (ii) the expiration of the last-to-expire patent held by Dana Farber containing a valid claim to any licensed product in such country. We are currently renegotiating certain terms of the Collaboration agreement with Checkpoint and may incur additional upfront payments when a definitive agreement is reached.

  TG-1701 (BTK inhibitor)
  
 In January 2018, we entered into a global exclusive license agreement with Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co., (Hengrui), to acquire worldwide intellectual property rights, excluding Asia but including Japan, and for the research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of products containing or comprising of any of Hengrui’s Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors containing the compounds of either TG-1701 (SHR-1459 or EBI-1459) or TG-1702 (SHR-1266 or EBI-1266) for hematologic malignancies. Pursuant to the agreement, we paid Hengrui an upfront fee of $1.0 million in our common stock. Hengrui is eligible to receive milestone payments totaling approximately $350 million upon and subject to the achievement of certain milestones. Various provisions allow for payments in conjunction with the agreement to be made in cash or our common stock, while others limit the form of payment. Royalty payments in the low double digits are due on net sales of licensed products and revenue from sublicenses. Additionally, before we can license, sell, develop, or commercialize ublituximab within China, we must notify Hengrui, giving Hengrui the right of first offer. The agreement allows combinations of TG-1701 or TG-1702 with umbralisib, ublituximab, or U2. Additional combinations may be undertaken under the agreement subject to additional pre-specified payments to Hengrui.
  
 The term of the agreement expires after the expiration of the last royalty term to expire with respect to any of the patent rights under the agreement. We or Hengrui may terminate the agreement upon notice to the other upon breach without remedy or upon insolvency. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement upon a material breach, after providing the other party with adequate notice and allowing 45 days to cure.
  
  TG-1801 (anti-CD47/anti-CD19 bispecific antibody)
  
 In June 2018, we entered into a Joint Venture and License Option Agreement with Novimmune SA (Novimmune) to collaborate on the development and commercialization of Novimmune’s novel first-in-class anti-CD47/anti-CD19 bispecific antibody known as TG-1801 (previously NI-1701). The companies will jointly develop the product on a worldwide basis, focusing on indications in the area of hematologic B-cell malignancies. We serve as the primary responsible party for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of the product. Pursuant to the agreement, in June 2018 we paid Novimmune an upfront payment of $3.0 million in our common stock. Further milestone payments will be paid based on early clinical development, and the Company will be responsible for the costs of clinical development of the product through the end of the Phase 2 clinical trials, after which the Company and Novimmune will be jointly responsible for all development and commercialization costs. The Company and Novimmune will each maintain an exclusive option, exercisable at specific times during development, for the Company to license the rights to TG-1801, in which case Novimmune is eligible to receive additional milestone payments totaling approximately $185 million as well as tiered royalties on net sales in the high single to low double digits upon and subject to the achievement of certain milestones.
  
IRAK4  
 In June 2014, we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (Ligand) for the development and commercialization of Ligand's interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase-4 (IRAK4) inhibitor technology, which currently is in preclinical development for potential use against certain cancers and autoimmune diseases. IRAK4 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is a key downstream signaling component of the interleukin-1 receptor and multiple toll-like receptors.
  
 Under the terms of the license agreement, Ligand received 125,000 shares of our common stock as an upfront license fee. Ligand will also be eligible to receive maximum potential milestone payments of approximately $207 million upon the achievement of specific clinical, regulatory and commercial milestone events. Additionally, Ligand will be entitled to royalties on our future net sales of licensed products containing IRAK4 inhibitors. The basic royalty rate for licensed products covered by Ligand's issued patents will be 6% for annual sales of up to $1 billion and 9.5% for annual sales in excess of that threshold. The license will terminate on a country by country basis upon the expiration of the last licensed patent right or 10 years after the first commercial sale of a product in such country, unless the agreement is earlier terminated by either party due to a breach of the agreement in the event of the insolvency of the other party.
  
  TG-1601 (BET inhibitor)
  
 In May 2016, as part of a broader agreement with Jubilant Biosys (Jubilant), an India-based biotechnology company, we entered into a sub-license agreement (JBET Agreement) with Checkpoint for the development and commercialization of Jubilant’s novel BET inhibitor program in the field of hematological malignancies. The BET inhibitor program is the subject of a family of patents covering compounds that inhibit BRD4, a member of the BET (Bromodomain and Extra Terminal) domain for cancer treatment. Our BET inhibitor program is currently in pre-clinical development.
  
 Under the terms of the agreement, we paid Checkpoint an up-front licensing fee of $1.0 million and will make additional payments contingent on certain preclinical, clinical, and regulatory milestones, including commercial milestones totaling up to approximately $177 million and a single-digit royalty on net sales.  TG will also provide funding to support certain targeted research efforts at Jubilant.

  COMPETITION
  
 Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense. Our competitors include pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and public and private research institutions. In addition, companies that are active in different but related fields represent substantial competition for us. Many of our competitors have significantly greater capital resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities and greater experience in drug development, regulation, manufacturing and marketing than we do. These organizations also compete with us to recruit qualified personnel, attract partners for joint ventures or other collaborations, and license technologies that are competitive with ours. To compete successfully in this industry we must identify novel and unique drugs or methods of treatment and then complete the development of those drugs as treatments in advance of our competitors.
  
 The drugs that we are attempting to develop will have to compete with existing therapies. In addition, a large number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting. Other companies have products or drug candidates in various stages of pre-clinical or clinical development to treat diseases for which we are also seeking to discover and develop drug candidates. Some of these potential competing drugs are further advanced in development than our drug candidates and may be commercialized earlier. The resulting changes in standard of care can impact the likelihood of regulatory accelerated approval opportunities for our drug candidates.
  
 For the cancer indications for which we are developing our products there are a number of established therapies with which we will compete:
  
   ●
 For the treatment of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, if U2 is approved, we expect U2 to compete with recently approved drugs such as ibrutinib (AbbVie and Janssen), venetoclax (AbbVie and Roche), obinutuzumab (Roche), idelalisib (Gilead) and duvelisib (Verastem), and established treatments such as rituximab (Roche), and several generically available chemotherapies. Additionally, there are two second generation BTK inhibitors similar to ibrutinib in late-stage clinical testing for CLL that could enter the market in the next 12-36 months. Each of these agents can be used as monotherapy or in combination with one or more of the other agents.

 
   ●
 For the treatment of Marginal Zone Lymphoma, if approved, we expect umbralisib to compete with ibrutinib (AbbVie and Janssen) and established treatments such as rituximab and several generically available chemotherapies. Additionally, the combination of rituximab and lenalidomide (Celgene) has been studied in MZL and may be approved.

 
   ●
 For the treatment of Follicular Lymphoma, if approved, we expect umbralisib to compete with recently approved drugs such as obinutuzumab (Roche), idelalisib (Gilead), copanlisib (Bayer), and duvelisib (Verastem), and established treatments such as rituximab (Roche), and several generically available chemotherapies. Each of these agents can be used as monotherapy or in combination with one or more of the other agents. The combination of rituximab and lenalidomide (Celgene) has also been studied in FL and may be approved. There are also several PI3K delta inhibitors in earlier stages of development.

 
   ●
 In addition, a number of pharmaceutical companies are developing antibodies and bispecific antibodies targeting CD20, CD19, CD47 and other B-cell associated targets, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (“CAR-T”) immunotherapy, and other B-cell ablative therapy which, if approved, would potentially compete with U2 and umbralisib.

   
 For Multiple Sclerosis for which we are developing ublituximab there are a number of established therapies with which we will compete:
  
   ●
 If ublituximab is approved, we expect ublituximab will primarily compete against other CD20 targeted agents, while the group of CD20 targeted agents will also compete broadly against a number of already approved MS therapies. Currently, there is one anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody approved, ocrelizumab (Roche), and another in Phase 3 development, ofatumumab (Novartis), which is expected to enter the market in the next 12-24 months.

 
 TG-1501, TG-1701 and TG-1801 if approved will also face competition from drugs on the market and under development that have the same mechanism of action as each of those drugs.

  SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING
  
 We have limited experience in manufacturing products for clinical or commercial purposes. We currently do not have any manufacturing capabilities of our own. We have established contract manufacturing relationships for the supply of ublituximab. We have also established contract manufacturing relationships for the supply of umbralisib as part of our licensing agreement with Rhizen. As with any supply program, obtaining pre-clinical and clinical materials of sufficient quality and quantity to meet the requirements of our development programs cannot be guaranteed and we cannot ensure that we will be successful in this endeavor. In addition, as we move closer to commercialization for ublituximab and umbralisib we will need to scale-up production to ensure adequate commercial supply, complete validation batches and complete pre-approval inspection batches. We are currently in the process of scaling up ublituximab and completing validation and pre-approval inspection batches for both ublituximab and umbralisib. This is an expensive process which will require significant investment on our part over the next 24 months and there can be no assurance given that such scale-up and process validation will be successful in providing pharmaceutical product that is of sufficient quantity, or of a quality that is consistent with our previously established specifications, or that meets the requirements set by regulatory agencies under which we may seek approval of our product candidates.
  
 Process improvements are common during clinical development to accommodate raw material and component variability, enhance productivity and/or accommodate different or larger equipment utilized during the scale-up process required for commercial manufacture. These types of incremental process changes have been made during clinical development for both TG’s small and large molecule programs. For example, our UNITY-CLL Phase 3 clinical trial contains ublituximab produced from both a pre-commercial process and the current commercial process. While there are some analytical differences between the two materials, we do not expect those differences to have an effect on the clinical performance of ublituximab. The primary difference is that the commercial process has resulted in further enhancement to the ADCC effect, potentially enhancing potency. We will analyze the Phase 3 data to ensure that the materials are substantially similar in performance. If there are material differences in safety or efficacy, we may need to adjust our statistical analysis of the Phase 3 study, which could impact the approvability of the U2 combination in CLL.
  
 At the time of commercial sale, to the extent possible and commercially practicable, we would seek to engage back-up suppliers for raw materials, manufacturing and testing services for each of our product candidates. Until such time, we expect that we will rely on a single contract manufacturer to produce each of our product candidates under current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, regulations. Our third-party manufacturers have a limited number of facilities in which our product candidates can be produced and will have limited experience in manufacturing our product candidates in quantities sufficient for commercialization. Our third-party manufacturers will have other clients and may have other priorities that could affect their ability to perform the work satisfactorily and/or on a timely basis. Both of these occurrences would be beyond our control. 
  
 We expect to similarly rely on contract manufacturing relationships for any products that we may in-license or acquire in the future. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully contract with such manufacturers on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
  
 Contract manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic and unannounced inspections by the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other state and federal regulations. Our contractors outside of the United States face similar challenges from the numerous local and regional agencies and authorized bodies. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers’ compliance with these regulations and standards, other than through contractual obligations. If they are deemed out of compliance with cGMPs, product recalls could result, inventory could be destroyed, production could be stopped and supplies could be delayed or otherwise disrupted.
  
 If we need to change manufacturers after commercialization, the FDA and corresponding foreign regulatory agencies must approve these new manufacturers in advance, which will involve testing and additional inspections to ensure compliance with FDA regulations and standards and may require significant lead times and delay. Furthermore, switching manufacturers may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers is limited. It may be difficult or impossible for us to find a replacement manufacturer quickly or on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
 
GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY REGULATION  
 Numerous governmental authorities, principally the FDA and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies, impose substantial regulations upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of our drug candidates, as well as our ongoing research and development activities. None of our drug candidates have been approved for sale in any market in which we have marketing rights. Before marketing in the U.S., any drug that we develop must undergo rigorous pre-clinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the FDA under the FDCA. The FDA regulates, among other things, the pre-clinical and clinical testing, safety, efficacy, approval, manufacturing, record keeping, adverse event reporting, packaging, labeling, storage, advertising, promotion, export, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products.

 
  
17


 
 The regulatory review and approval process is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. We are required to submit extensive pre-clinical and clinical data and supporting information to the FDA for each indication or use to establish a drug candidate’s safety and efficacy before we can secure FDA approval to market or sell a product in the U.S. The approval process takes many years, requires the expenditure of substantial resources and may involve ongoing requirements for post-marketing studies or surveillance. Before commencing clinical trials in humans, we must submit an IND to the FDA containing, among other things, pre-clinical data, chemistry, manufacturing and control information, and an investigative plan. Our submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial.
  
 Clinical testing must meet requirements for institutional review board oversight, informed consent and good clinical practices, and must be conducted pursuant to an IND, unless exempted. In addition, the FDA, equivalent foreign regulatory authority, or a data safety monitoring committee for a trial may place a clinical trial on hold or terminate it if it concludes that subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, or for futility. Any drug is likely to produce some toxicity or undesirable side effects in animals and in humans when administered at sufficiently high doses and/or for a sufficiently long period of time. Unacceptable toxicity or side effects may occur at any dose level at any time in the course of studies in animals designed to identify unacceptable effects of a drug candidate, known as toxicological studies, or clinical trials of drug candidates. The appearance of any unacceptable toxicity or side effect could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, limit, delay or abort the development of any of our drug candidates and could ultimately prevent approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications.
  
 For purposes of NDA approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases:
  
  ●
   Phase 1: The drug is administered to a small group of humans, either healthy volunteers or patients, to test for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, excretion, and clinical pharmacology.

 
  ●
   Phase 2: Studies are conducted on a larger number of patients to assess the efficacy of the product, to ascertain dose tolerance and the optimal dose range, and to gather additional data relating to safety and potential adverse events.

 
  ●
   Phase 3: Studies establish safety and efficacy in an expanded patient population.

 
  ●
   Phase 4: The FDA may require Phase 4 post-marketing studies to find out more about the drug’s long-term risks, benefits, and optimal use, or to test the drug in different populations.

 
    The length of time necessary to complete clinical trials varies significantly and may be difficult to predict. Clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals. Additional factors that can cause delay or termination of our clinical trials, or that may increase the costs of these trials, include:   
  ●
  slow patient enrollment due to the nature of the clinical trial plan, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for participation in the study or other factors;

 
  ●
  inadequately trained or insufficient personnel at the study site to assist in overseeing and monitoring clinical trials or delays in approvals from a study site’s review board;

 
  ●
  longer treatment time required to demonstrate efficacy or determine the appropriate product dose;

 
  ●
  insufficient supply of the drug candidates;

 
  ●
  adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients; and

 
  ●
  ineffectiveness of the drug candidates.

  
 For clinical trials that are intended to form the basis of a new drug or biologics license application for approval, sponsors of drugs may apply for an SPA from the FDA, by which the FDA provides official evaluation and written guidance on the design and size of proposed protocols. While obtaining an SPA provides some assurance the design of a trial should be sufficient for approval, the final marketing approval depends on the results of efficacy, the adverse event profile and an evaluation of the benefit/risk of treatment demonstrated in the Phase 3 trial. The SPA agreement may only be changed through a written agreement between the sponsor and the FDA, or if the FDA becomes aware of a substantial scientific issue essential to product safety or efficacy.
  

  
18


 

   In September 2015, we reached an agreement with the FDA regarding an SPA on the design, endpoints and statistical analysis approach of a Phase 3 clinical trial, referred to as the UNITY-CLL trial, for the proprietary combination of ublituximab and umbralisib, for the treatment of CLL. The SPA provides agreement that the Phase 3 trial design adequately addresses objectives that, if met, would support the regulatory submission for drug approval of both ublituximab and umbralisib in combination. Additionally, in August 2017, we reached an agreement with the FDA regarding an SPA on the design of two Phase 3 clinical trials for ublituximab, referred to as the ULTIMATE I and ULTIMATE II Phase 3 clinical trials, for the treatment of relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis (RMS). The SPA provides agreement that the two Phase 3 trial designs adequately address objectives that, if met, would support the regulatory submission for approval of ublituximab. Despite obtaining an SPA the trials may not be positive and even if positive may not support FDA approval.
  
 The FDA may permit expedited development, evaluation, and marketing of new therapies intended to treat persons with serious or life-threatening conditions for which there is an unmet medical need under its fast track drug development programs. A sponsor can apply for fast track designation at the time of submission of an IND, or at any time prior to receiving marketing approval of the new drug application, or NDA. To receive Fast Track designation, an applicant must demonstrate:
  
  ●
  that the drug is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition;

  
  ●
  that nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need

 
 The FDA must respond to a request for fast track designation within 60 calendar days of receipt of the request. Over the course of drug development, a product in a fast track development program must continue to meet the criteria for fast track designation. Sponsors of products in fast track drug development programs must be in regular contact with the reviewing division of the FDA to ensure that the evidence necessary to support marketing approval will be developed and presented in a format conducive to an efficient review. Sponsors of products in fast track drug development programs ordinarily are eligible for priority review of a completed application in six months or less and also may be permitted to submit portions of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) to the FDA for review before the complete application is submitted.
  
     In addition, sponsors may also apply to the FDA for Breakthrough Therapy Designation (“BTD”). The procedures and requirements for BTD are similar to those required for fast track such that the Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the development and review of a potential new drug for serious or life-threatening diseases however with BTD, there is a further requirement that the sponsor present “preliminary clinical evidence” which “indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.” The designation of a drug as a Breakthrough Therapy was enacted as part of the 2012 Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act.
 
     In January 2019, we announced that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for umbralisib for the treatment of adult patients with marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who have received at least one prior anti-CD20 regimen based on interim results from a subset of patients from the MZL cohort of the UNITY-NHL clinical trial.
  
  Sponsors of drugs designated as fast track and as breakthrough therapy also may seek approval under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations. Under this authority, the FDA may grant marketing approval for a new drug product on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely, based on epidemiologic, therapeutic, pathophysiologic, or other evidence, to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. To obtain accelerated approval you have to be the first company to have a treatment that successfully addresses a certain unmet medical need or you need to clearly be better than all other treatments for that medical need, subject to certain qualifications. Many companies have filed for accelerated approval and have subsequently failed to obtain such approval for a variety of reasons, including not being first or not being best. To the extent a product does obtain an accelerated approval, such approval will be subject to the requirement that the applicant study the drug further in a post-marketing confirmation clinical trial to verify and describe its clinical benefit where there is uncertainty as to the relation of the surrogate endpoint to clinical benefit or uncertainty as to the relation of the observed clinical benefit to ultimate outcome. Accelerated approval is sometimes referred to as conditional approval because if the results of these confirmation clinical trials are not successful, the FDA has the right to remove the drug from the market and has done so in the past.  Post-marketing confirmation studies are usually underway at the time an applicant files the NDA.  When required to be conducted, such post-marketing confirmation studies must also be adequate and well-controlled.  The applicant must carry out any such post-marketing confirmation studies with due diligence.  

  
  
19


 
  
      It is also becoming more common for the FDA to request a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, as part of a NDA/BLA. The REMS plan contains post-market obligations of the sponsor to train prescribing physicians, monitor off-label drug use, and conduct Phase 4 follow-up studies and registries to ensure the continued safe use of the drug.

 
 As part of the approval process, the FDA must inspect and approve each manufacturing facility. Among the conditions of approval is the requirement that a manufacturer’s quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP. Manufacturers must expend significant time, money and effort to ensure continued compliance, and the FDA conducts periodic inspections to certify compliance. It may be difficult for our manufacturers or us to comply with the applicable cGMP, as interpreted by the FDA, and other FDA regulatory requirements. If we, or our contract manufacturers, fail to comply, then the FDA may not allow us to market products that have been affected by the failure. Many drug approvals have been delayed due to issues at contract manufacturing facilities. If we were to experience any such delay that would negatively impact our business and timeline to commercialization of any of our drug candidates affected by such manufacturing issue.
  
 If the FDA grants approval, the approval will be limited to those disease states, conditions and patient populations for which the product is safe and effective, as demonstrated through clinical studies. Further, a product may be marketed only in those dosage forms and for those indications approved in the NDA/BLA. Certain changes to an approved NDA/BLA, including, with certain exceptions, any significant changes to labeling, require approval of a supplemental application before the drug may be marketed as changed. Any products that we manufacture or distribute pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continued monitoring and regulation by the FDA, including compliance with cGMP and the reporting of adverse experiences with the drugs. The nature of marketing claims that the FDA will permit us to make in the labeling and advertising of our products will generally be limited to those specified in FDA approved labeling, and the advertising of our products will be subject to comprehensive monitoring and regulation by the FDA. Drugs whose review was accelerated may carry additional requirements on marketing activities, including the requirement that all promotional materials are pre-submitted to the FDA. Claims exceeding those contained in approved labeling will constitute a violation of the FDCA. Violations of the FDCA or regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or marketing and sale following approval may result in agency enforcement actions, including withdrawal of approval, recall, seizure of products, warning letters, injunctions, fines and/or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business.
  
 Should we wish to market our products outside the U.S., we must receive marketing authorization from the appropriate foreign regulatory authorities. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. Importantly, the level of evidence of efficacy and safety necessary to apply for marketing authorization for a drug candidate differs from country to country. In particular, clinical trial endpoints, and the level of clinical evidence that may support an accelerated approval filing with the US FDA, such as the ORR data we intend to use as the basis for a filing for umbralisib in MZL, may be insufficient to file for marketing application outside of the US. At present, companies are typically required to apply for foreign marketing authorizations at a national level. However, within the European Union, registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one European Union member state. Typically, if the regulatory authority is satisfied that a company has presented adequate evidence of safety, quality and efficacy, then the regulatory authority will grant a marketing authorization. This foreign regulatory approval process, however, involves risks similar or identical to the risks associated with FDA approval discussed above, and therefore we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain the appropriate marketing authorization for any product in any particular country.
      Failure to comply with applicable federal, state and foreign laws and regulations would likely have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of new drugs are subject to future changes. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature, effect or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad.
  
  Coverage and Reimbursement
 
 Sales of our drugs will depend, in part, on the extent to which our drugs will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical drugs and services. In addition, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic drugs. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our drug candidates, if approved, or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our drug candidates could reduce physician usage of such drugs and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.

   The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for drugs for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our drugs covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
 
 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. The plan for the research was published in 2012 by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of our drug candidates, if any such drug or the condition that they are intended to treat is the subject of a trial. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s drug could adversely affect the sales of our drug candidate. If third-party payors do not consider our drugs to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our drugs after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our drugs on a profitable basis.
 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the Affordable Care Act, enacted in March 2010, has had a significant impact on the health care industry. The Affordable Care Act expanded coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D.
 
    In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, started in April 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, then President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, which among other things, also reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare drugs and services, and in turn could significantly reduce the projected value of certain development projects and reduce our profitability. In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, that while not a law, is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of legislation that would repeal certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TJCA, includes a provision repealing the individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019. Further, on January 20, 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On October 13, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order terminating the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the Affordable Care Act. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating these subsidies, but on October 25, 2017, a federal judge in California denied their request for a restraining order. In addition, CMS has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the health benefits required under the Affordable Care Act for plans sold through these marketplaces. There may be further action to repeal, replace or modify the Affordable Care Act. While any legislative and regulatory changes will likely take time to develop, and may or may not have an impact on the regulatory regime to which we are subject, we cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us.

  In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal drugs for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal drugs for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal drug or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal drug on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical drugs will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our drugs. Historically, drugs launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.
 
  Other Healthcare Laws
 
 We may also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments where we may market our product candidates, if approved. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations.
 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
 
     In addition, the civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the U.S., for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, also created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 
 There has also been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposes new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Drug manufacturers are required to submit annual reports to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which publicly posts the data on its website. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.

 We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, we may be subject to state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
  EMPLOYEES
  
 As of February 20, 2019, we had 105 full and part-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
