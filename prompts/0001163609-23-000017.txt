Item 1. Business.
Overview
South Dakota Soybean Processors, LLC (“we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) owns and operates a soybean processing plant and a soybean oil refinery in Volga, South Dakota, which has been operating since 1996 and 2002, respectively. We also own and operate an oilseed processing plant near Miller, South Dakota, which has been operating since 2015. On February 9, 2022, we announced plans to construct a new oilseed processing plant near Mitchell, South Dakota, which we expect to be operational in 2025.
We are owned by approximately 2,200 members, most of whom reside in South Dakota and neighboring states and many of whom deliver and sell soybeans to our plants for processing.
Our core business consists of processing locally grown soybeans into soybean meal and soybean oil. We sell the soybean meal primarily to resellers, feed mills, and livestock producers as livestock feed. We market and sell multiple grades of soybean oil in either crude or refined format. Crude and refined soybean oil are marketed and sold to the food, biodiesel and chemical industries. Under certain market conditions, we may register and deliver warehouse receipts for crude oil under specific terms and conditions of a Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) soybean oil futures contract.
We strive to maintain a competitive position in the marketplace by producing high quality products, operating a highly efficient operation, and adding value to our core products to capture larger margins. We continue to research ways to improve overall efficiencies by analyzing new methods of vertical integration, adding value to our products through further investment in processing, and studying new applications for our products in the food and energy fields. Although a primary objective is to maximize the issuance of cash distributions to our members from profits generated from operations, we recognize the need to maintain our financial strength by reinvesting and making capital improvements in our operations' facilities.
General Development of Business
We were originally organized and operated as a South Dakota cooperative in 1993. In 2002, we reorganized and converted from a cooperative into a South Dakota limited liability company. As a limited liability company, we are taxed as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes, which allows us to pass through our income and losses to our members for inclusion in their tax returns.
We began processing soybeans into soybean meal, crude soybean oil, and soybean hulls in 1996. Since this time we have made significant capital improvements and expanded our business to include the development of vertically integrated product lines and services. In 2002, we completed the construction of a refining facility and began refining crude soybean oil. In 2011, we completed the construction and start-up of a deodorizer at our facility, which allows us to deodorize refined soybean oil and sell the oil directly to customers in the food industry. In 2014, we purchased an oilseed processing plant located near Miller, South Dakota, approximately 100 miles west of our main facility in Volga. The Miller plant has allowed us to expand into new markets by processing identity-preserved soybeans, including non-genetically modified organisms (GMO) and organic soybeans. On February 9, 2022, we announced plans to construct a third oilseed processing plant near Mitchell, South Dakota, which is expected to be operational in 2025.
Industry Information
Global soybean production is concentrated in the U.S., Brazil, Argentina and China. The United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) reported that, for the 2022 crop year, the U.S. produced approximately 4.35 billion bushels of soybeans, or approximately 30% of estimated world production, with Brazil producing 5.6 billion bushels and Argentina producing 1.5 billion bushels. Global production may fluctuate year-to-year due to any number of factors, including but not limited to, weather, government policy, economic conditions, and commodity prices. Similarly, global soybean consumption may fluctuate year to-year due to any number of factors including, but is not limited to, economic conditions, global health concerns, population growth and international trade policy. Soybeans are a staple commodity used pervasively across the globe; thus,any contractions in consumption may only be temporary as historically has been the case.
The soybean processing industry converts soybeans into three principal products: soybean meal, soybean hulls, and soybean oil. A bushel of soybeans, weighing approximately 60 pounds, typically yields, after processing, approximately forty-four pounds of meal, four pounds of hulls, and eleven pounds of crude oil. Soybean meal and hulls are mostly used by livestock producers and the fish farming industry as feed. Soybean oil is sold in multiple grades, and is used in the food, petroleum and chemical industries. The food industry uses soybean oil in, among others, cooking and salad dressings, baking and frying fats, and butter substitutes.
Soybean processing facilities are generally located close to adequate sources of soybeans and where there is a strong demand for soybean meal. Soybean meal is predominantly fed to and consumed by poultry and swine in the U.S. On average, exports of soybean meal account for 20% to 30% of total production. The USDA estimates that approximately 51% of soybeans produced in the U.S. are processed domestically, 46% are exported as whole soybeans, and 3% are retained for seed and residual use. 
Soybean oil refineries are generally located close to soybean processing plants. Soybean oil is shipped throughout the U.S. and for export. The USDA estimates that approximately 54% of domestic soybean oil production is used in food, feed and industrial applications, 4% in biofuels production, and 3% for export for various uses.
The soybean industry continues to introduce soy-based products as substitutes for various petroleum-based products including lubricants, plastics, ink, crayons and candles. Soybean oil is converted to biofuels such as biodiesel or renewable diesel. Biodiesel and renewable diesel, substitutes for standard, petroleum-based diesel fuel, has experienced rapid growth recently following the expansion of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program and resumption of the biodiesel blenders’ tax credit.
Soybean crushing and refining margins are generally cyclical in nature. The price of soybeans may fluctuate substantially from year to year, whereas the price of meal and oil generally tracks that of soybeans, although not necessarily on a one-for-one basis; therefore, margins can be variable.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
We purchase soybeans for processing from local soybean producers and elevators. The State of South Dakota and the upper Midwest, historically has produced and provided an adequate supply of soybean for our procurement and the soybean processing industry in general. In 2022, agricultural producers in South Dakota grew and harvested 197 million bushels of soybeans, ranking South Dakota ninth among the top producing states in the U.S., as illustrated in the following table:

State | Production (bushels)
Illinois | 685 million 
Iowa | 591 million 
Minnesota | 369 million 
Indiana | 344 million 
Missouri | 290 million 
Nebraska | 285 million 
Ohio | 279 million 
North Dakota | 203 million 
South Dakota | 197 million 
Arkansas | 167 million 

Producers in South Dakota, by comparison, grew and harvested approximately 223 million bushels in 2021, 224 million bushels in 2020, 146 million bushels in 2019, and 275 million bushels in 2018. Of this amount, we processed 34.5 million bushels in 2022, compared to 34.9 million bushels in 2021, 34.3 million bushels in 2020, 33.0 million bushels in 2019, and 33.2 million bushels in 2018. We control the flow of soybeans into our facilities with a combination of pricing and contracting options. Threats to our soybean supply include weather, changes in government programs, and competition from other processors and export markets.
Products and Services
We process soybeans at our two crushing plants which extract the soybean oil from the protein and fiber portions of the soybean. Approximately 80% of a soybean bushel is processed and sold as soybean meal or hulls, with the remaining 20% extracted as crude soybean oil.
Sales, Marketing and Customers
Our soybean meal is primarily sold to resellers, feed mills, and livestock producers as livestock feed. The meal is primarily sold to customers in the local area (typically within 200 miles of our Volga facility), Western U.S., and Canada. Our crude soybean oil is sold to refining companies for further processing or refined at our facilities and sold directly to the food industry for human consumption, or to the biofuel industry as transportation fuel.
In 2022, our percentage of sales by quantity of product sold within various markets is illustrated by the following table:

Market | Soybean Meal | CrudeSoybeanOil | RefinedOil
Local | 51% | 100% | 23% 
Other U.S. States | 17% | —% | 68% 
Export | 32% | —% | 9% 

Over half of our products are shipped by rail, the service of which is provided by the Rapid City, Pierre & Eastern (RCP&E) rail line, owned and operated by Genesee & Wyoming, Inc., which connects to the Burlington-Northern Santa Fe, Canadian Pacific (CP), and the Union Pacific rail lines.
All of our assets and operations are domiciled in South Dakota, and all of the products sold are produced in South Dakota.
Dependence upon a Single Customer
None.
Competition
We are in direct competition with several other soybean processing companies in the U.S., many of which have significantly greater resources than we do. The U.S. soybean processing industry is comprised primarily of 16 different companies which operate 62 plants in the U.S. The industry is generally characterized as mature, consolidated and vertically-integrated, with four companies - Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), Bunge, Cargill and Ag Processing (AGP) - controlling nearly 84% of the processing industry. The U.S. vegetable oil (including soybean oil) refining industry is divided between oilseed processors and independent vegetable oil refiners. The oilseed processors operate approximately 83% of the vegetable oil refining capacity in the U.S., and ADM, Bunge, Cargill and AGP operate approximately 68% of the oil refining capacity. The three largest independent vegetable oil refiners are ACH Foods (in joint venture with ADM), Smuckers (Proctor & Gamble), and ConAgra (Hunt-Wesson).
We are one of two operating soybean processing companies in South Dakota. AGP operates a processing facility in Aberdeen, South Dakota, approximately 160 miles from our Volga facility. Our processing facilities represent approximately 7% of the total soybean processing capacity in the upper Midwest and about 1.3% in the U.S. We continue to maintain a competitive position in the market by producing high quality products and operating highly efficient operations at the lowest possible cost. Adding value to our products is a consistent objective. We are a principal investor in Prairie AquaTech, a company engaged in the research, development and production of high quality protein ingredients derived from soybeans. Our investment led to the construction and operation of a production facility immediately adjacent to our Volga plant in 2019.
Utilities
Volga, South Dakota
We use natural gas and electricity to operate the crushing and refining plants in Volga, South Dakota. Natural gas is used for processing heat and for drying soybeans. Our natural gas provider is NorthWestern Corporation, Sioux Falls, South Dakota. We are at risk to adverse price fluctuations in the natural gas market, but we have the capability to use fuel oil and biofuel as a backup to natural gas in the event of delivery interruption or market conditions dictate. We also employ forward contracting to offset some of this risk. Our electricity provider is the City of Volga, South Dakota.
Miller, South Dakota
We use electricity and propane to operate the mechanical press plant in Miller, South Dakota, as natural gas distribution lines are not located in the area. Our electricity provider is NorthWestern Corporation, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and CHS Farmers Alliance, Mitchell, South Dakota, is our propane provider.
Employees
We currently employ approximately 120 individuals, all but six of whom are full-time. We have no unions or other collective bargaining agreements.
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
Our business is subject to laws and related regulations and rules designed to protect the environment which are administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources and similar government agencies. These laws, regulations and rules govern the discharge of materials to the environment, air and water; reporting storage of hazardous wastes; the transportation, handling and disposition of wastes; and the labeling of pesticides and similar substances. Our business is also subject to laws and related regulations and rules administered by other federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies that govern the processing, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling, quality and safety of feed and grain products. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations and rules could subject us to administrative penalties, injunctive relief, civil remedies and possible recalls of products.
The sale of soybean oil for human consumption is impacted by the regulation of trans-fat, which results from the hydrogenation process of products such as soybean oil and plant oils. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires that food processors disclose the level of trans-fatty acids contained in their products. In addition, various local governments in the U.S. have enacted, or are considering enacting, restrictions on the use of trans-fats in restaurants. As a result, many food manufacturers have reduced the amount of hydrogenated soybean oil included in their products or switched to other oils containing lower amounts of trans-fat.
