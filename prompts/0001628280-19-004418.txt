Item 1. | Business

​
GSV Capital
GSV Capital Corp. (the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “GSV Capital”), a Maryland corporation, is an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). In addition, we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). We commenced operations upon completion of our initial public offering (“IPO”) in May 2011. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Recent Developments” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.
Our investment objective is to maximize our portfolio’s total return, principally by seeking capital gains on our equity and equity-related investments. We invest principally in the equity securities of what we believe to be rapidly growing venture-capital-backed emerging companies. We acquire our investments through direct investments in prospective portfolio companies, secondary marketplaces for private companies and negotiations with selling stockholders. We may also invest on an opportunistic basis in select publicly traded equity securities or certain non-U.S. companies that otherwise meet our investment criteria. Our investment activities are supervised by our Board of Directors and managed by our investment adviser, GSV Asset Management, LLC (“GSV Asset Management”), and our administrator, GSV Capital Service Company, LLC (“GSV Capital Service Company”), provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Recent Developments” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.
Our investment philosophy is based on a disciplined approach of identifying potentially high-growth emerging companies across several key industry themes which may include, among others, social mobile, cloud computing and big data, internet commerce, sustainability and education technology. GSV Asset Management’s investment decisions are based on a disciplined analysis of available information regarding each potential portfolio company’s business operations, focusing on the company’s growth potential, the quality of recurring revenues and cash flow and cost structures, as well as an understanding of key market fundamentals. Venture capital funds or other financial or strategic sponsors have invested in the vast majority of the companies that GSV Asset Management evaluates.
We seek to deploy capital primarily in the form of non-controlling equity and equity-related investments, including common stock, warrants, preferred stock and similar forms of senior equity, which may or may not be convertible into a portfolio company’s common equity, and convertible debt securities with a significant equity component. Typically, our preferred stock investments are non-income producing, have different voting rights than our common stock investments and are generally convertible into common stock at our discretion.
We seek to create a low-turnover portfolio that includes investments in companies representing a broad range of investment themes.
Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “GSVC”. The net asset value per share of our common stock on December 31, 2018 was $9.89. On April 17, 2019, the last reported sale price of a share of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market was $6.52.
Internalization of Operating Structure
On and effective March 12, 2019 (the “Effective Date”), our Board of Directors approved internalizing our operating structure (our “Internalization”) and we began operating as an internally managed non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act, as of the Effective Date.
In connection with our Internalization, the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement (as such terms are defined in this Form 10-K) were terminated as of the Effective Date.  As of such date, we entered into a Consulting Agreement with Michael T. Moe (the former Chairman of our Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of GSV Asset Management), pursuant to which Mr. Moe will provide certain services to us in connection with our transition to an internally managed operating structure. We also entered into an Amended and Restated Trademark License Agreement with GSV Asset Management to continue to use the trade name “GSV”, and other state or unregistered “GSV” marks, including the trading symbol “GSVC.”

Investment Opportunity
We believe that society is experiencing a convergence of numerous disruptive trends, producing new high-growth markets. For example, the growth of both social networking and connected mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, has opened up new channels for communication and real-time collaboration. The number of devices and people that regularly connect to the Internet has increased in recent years, generating significant demand for always accessible, personalized and localized content and real-time online interactivity. Similarly, the advent of education technology, and insights with respect to how, and what, people learn, are also disrupting the traditional educational sector. These factors are creating opportunities for new market participants and significant growth for established companies with leading positions capitalizing on these trends.
At the same time, we believe that the IPO markets have experienced substantial structural changes which have made it significantly more challenging for private companies to go public. Volatile equity markets, a lack of investment research coverage for private and smaller companies and investor demand for a longer history of revenue and earnings growth have resulted in companies staying private significantly longer than in the past. In addition, increased public company compliance obligations such as those imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) have made it more costly and less attractive to become a public company. As a result, there are significantly fewer IPOs today than there were during the 1990s, with prospective public companies taking longer to come to market.
Investment Strategy
We seek to maintain our portfolio of potentially high-growth emerging private companies via a repeatable and disciplined investment approach, as well as to provide investors with access to such companies through our publicly traded common stock.
Our investment objective is to maximize our portfolio’s total return, principally by seeking capital gains on our equity and equity-related investments. We have adopted the following business strategies to achieve our investment objective:

• | Identify high quality growth companies. Based on our extensive experience in analyzing technology trends and markets, we have identified the technology sub-sectors of social mobile, cloud computing and big data, internet commerce, sustainability and education technology, as opportunities where we believe companies are capable of producing substantial growth. We rely on our collective industry knowledge as well as an understanding of where leading venture capitalists are investing. 

​
We leverage a combination of our relationships throughout Silicon Valley and our independent research to identify leaders in our targeted sub-sectors that we believe are differentiated and best positioned for sustained growth. Our evaluation process is based on what we refer to as “the four P’s”:

• | People—Organizations led by strong management teams with in-depth operational focus


• | Product—Differentiated and disruptive products with leading market positioning

​

• | Potential—Large addressable markets

​

• | Predictability—Ability to forecast and drive predictable and sustainable growth

​
We consider these to be the core elements for identifying rapidly growing emerging companies.

TABLE OF CONTENTS


• | Acquire positions in targeted investments. We seek to add to our portfolio by sourcing investments at an acceptable price through our disciplined investing strategy. To this end, we utilize multiple methods to acquire equity stakes in private companies that are not available to many individual investors. 

​
Direct equity investments.   We seek direct investments in private companies. There is a large market among emerging private companies for equity capital investments. Many of these companies, particularly within the technology sector, lack the necessary cash flows to sustain substantial amounts of debt, and therefore have viewed equity capital as a more attractive long-term financing tool. We seek to be a source of such equity capital as a means of investing in these companies and look for opportunities to invest alongside other venture capital and private equity investors with whom we have established relationships.
Private secondary marketplaces and direct share purchases.   We also utilize private secondary marketplaces as a means to acquire equity and equity-related interests in privately held companies that meet our investment criteria and that we believe are attractive candidates for investment. We believe that such markets offer new channels for access to equity investments in private companies and provide a potential source of liquidity should we decide to exit an investment. In addition, we also purchase shares directly from stockholders, including current or former employees. As certain companies grow and experience significant increased value while remaining private, employees and other stockholders may seek liquidity by selling shares directly to a third party or to a third party via a secondary marketplace. Sales of shares in private companies are typically restricted by contractual transfer restrictions and may be further restricted by provisions in company charter documents, investor rights of first refusal and co-sale and company employment and trading policies, which may impose strict limits on transfer. We believe that the reputation of GSV Asset Management’s investment professionals within the industry and established history of investing affords us a favorable position when seeking approval for a purchase of shares subject to such limitations.

• | Create access to a varied investment portfolio. We seek to hold a varied portfolio of non-controlling equity investments, which we believe will minimize the impact on our portfolio of a negative downturn at any one specific company. We believe that our relatively varied portfolio will provide a convenient means for accredited and non-accredited individual investors to obtain access to an asset class that has generally been limited to venture capital, private equity and similar large institutional investors. 

Starting in 2017, we began to focus our investment strategy to increase the size of our investments in individual portfolio companies. While this will likely have the effect of reducing the number of companies in which we hold investments, we believe that the shift towards larger positions will better allow GSV Asset Management's investment professionals to focus our investments in companies and industries that are more likely to result in beneficial returns to our stockholders.
​
Competitive Advantages
We believe that we benefit from the following competitive advantages in executing our investment strategy:

• | Experienced team of investment professionals. GSV Asset Management’s senior investment professionals and our Board of Directors have significant experience researching and investing in the types of potentially rapidly growing venture-capital-backed emerging companies we are targeting for investment. Through our proprietary company-evaluation process, including our identification of technology trends and themes and company research, we believe we have developed important insight into identifying and valuing emerging private companies. 


• | Disciplined and repeatable investment process. We have established a disciplined and repeatable process to locate and acquire available shares at attractive valuations by utilizing multiple sources. In contrast to industry “aggregators” that accumulate stock at market prices, we conduct valuation analyses and make acquisitions only when we can invest at valuations that we believe are attractive to our investors. 

​

• | Deep relationships with significant credibility to source and complete transactions. GSV Asset Management, including its senior investment professionals, are strategically located in the heart of Silicon Valley in Woodside, California. During the course of over two decades of researching and investing in emerging private companies, GSV Asset Management’s senior investment professionals have developed strong reputations within the investing community, particularly within technology-related sectors. GSV Asset Management’s senior investment professionals have also developed strong relationships in the financial, investing and technology-related sectors.

TABLE OF CONTENTS


• | Source of permanent investing capital. As a publicly traded corporation, we have access to a source of permanent equity capital that we can use to invest in portfolio companies. This permanent equity capital is a significant differentiator from other potential investors that may be required to return capital to stockholders on a defined schedule. We believe that our ability to invest on a long-term time horizon makes us attractive to companies looking for strong, stable owners of their equity. 


• | Early mover advantage. We believe we are one of the few publicly traded BDCs with a specific focus on investing in potentially rapidly growing venture-capital-backed emerging companies. The transactions that we have executed to date since our IPO have helped to establish our reputation with the types of secondary sellers and emerging companies that we target for investment. We have leveraged a number of relationships and channels to acquire the equity of private companies. As we continue to grow our portfolio with attractive investments, we believe that our reputation as a committed partner will be further enhanced, allowing us to source and close investments that would otherwise be unavailable. We believe that these factors collectively differentiate us from other potential investors in private company securities and will serve our goal to complete equity transactions in compelling private companies at attractive valuations. 

Our primary competitors include specialty finance companies including late-stage venture capital funds, private equity funds, other crossover funds, public funds investing in private companies and public and private BDCs. Many of these entities have greater financial and managerial resources than we will have. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider more investments and establish more relationships than we do. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Structure” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Investment Process
Concentrated Technology-related Focus
During the course of over two decades of researching and investing in non-public companies, GSV Asset Management’s investment professionals have identified five areas from which we expect to see significant numbers of high-growth companies emerge: new media, communication, alternative energy, education technology, and the consumerization of information technology. These broad markets have the potential to produce disruptive technologies, reach a large addressable market and provide significant commercial opportunities. Within these areas, GSV Asset Management has identified broad trends that could create significant positive effects on growth such as globalization, consolidation, branding, convergence and network effects. From within these broad technology themes, GSV Asset Management has selected five sub-segments in which it target companies for our investment: social mobile, cloud computing and big data, internet commerce, sustainability and education technology. We remain focused on selecting market leaders within the sub-segments identified, while continuing to review our pipeline to ensure we are tracking the next phase of leaders.
Investment Targeting and Screening
We identify prospective portfolio companies through an extensive network of relationships developed by GSV Asset Management’s senior investment professionals, supplemented by the knowledge and relationships of our Board of Directors. Investment opportunities that fall within our identified themes are validated against the observed behavior of leading venture capitalists and through our own internal and external research. We evaluate potential portfolio companies across a spectrum of criteria, including “the four Ps,” industry positioning and leadership, stage of growth, and several other factors that collectively characterize our proprietary investment process. We typically seek to invest approximately 90% of our portfolio in well-established, late stage companies and the remaining approximately 10% in emerging companies that fit within our targeted areas, where we see the potential for higher returns from early investment. Based on our initial screening, we identify a select set of companies that we evaluate in greater depth.
Research and Due Diligence Process
Once we identify those companies that we believe warrant more in-depth analysis, we focus on their revenue growth, revenue quality and sustainability and earnings growth, as well as other metrics that may be strongly correlated with higher valuations. We also focus on the company’s management team and any significant financial sponsor, their current business model, competitive positioning, regulatory and legal issues, the quality of any intellectual property and other investment-specific due diligence. Each prospective portfolio company that passes our initial due diligence review is given a qualitative ranking to allow us to evaluate it against others in our pipeline, and we review and update these companies on a regular basis.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Our due diligence process will vary depending on whether we are investing through a private secondary transaction on a marketplace or with a selling stockholder or by direct equity investment. We access information on our potential investments through a variety of sources, including information made available on secondary marketplaces, publications by private company research firms, industry publications, commissioned analysis by third-party research firms, and, to a limited extent, directly from the company or financial sponsor. We utilize a combination of each of these sources to help us set a target value for the companies we ultimately select for investment.
Portfolio Construction and Sourcing
Upon completion of our research and due diligence process, we select investments for inclusion in our portfolio based on their relative qualitative ranking, fundamentals and valuation. We seek to create a relatively varied portfolio that we expect will include investments in companies representing a broad range of investment themes. We generally choose to pursue specific investments based on the availability of shares and valuation expectations. We utilize a combination of secondary marketplaces, direct purchases from stockholders and direct equity investments in order to make investments in our portfolio companies. Once we have established an initial position in a portfolio company, we may choose to increase our stake through subsequent purchases. Maintaining a balanced portfolio is a key to our success, and as a result we constantly evaluate the composition of our investments and our pipeline to ensure we are exposed to a diverse set of companies within our target segments.
Transaction Execution
We enter into purchase agreements for substantially all of our private company portfolio investments. Private company securities are typically subject to contractual transfer limitations, which may, among other things, give the issuer, its assignees and/or its stockholders a particular period of time, often 30 days or more, in which to exercise a veto right, or a right of first refusal over, the sale of such securities. Accordingly, the purchase agreements we enter into for secondary transactions typically require the lapse or satisfaction of these rights as a condition to closing. Under these circumstances, we may be required to deposit the purchase price into escrow upon signing, with the funds released to the seller at closing or returned to us if the closing conditions are not met.
Risk Management and Monitoring
We monitor the financial trends of each portfolio company to assess our exposure to individual companies as well as to evaluate overall portfolio quality. We establish valuation targets at the portfolio level and for gross and net exposures with respect to specific companies and industries within our overall portfolio. In cases where we make a direct investment in a portfolio company, we may also obtain board positions, board observation rights and/or information rights from that portfolio company in connection with our equity investment. We regularly monitor our portfolio for compliance with the diversification requirements for purposes of maintaining our status as a BDC and a RIC for tax purposes.
Managerial Assistance
As a BDC we are required to offer, and in some cases may provide and be paid for, significant managerial assistance to portfolio companies. This assistance typically involves monitoring the operations of portfolio companies, participating in their board and management meetings, consulting with and advising their officers and providing other organizational and financial guidance. GSV Asset Management will provide such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request assistance. We may receive fees for these services and will reimburse GSV Asset Management for its allocated costs in providing such assistance, subject to review by our Board of Directors, including our independent directors.

Determination of Net Asset Value
We determine the net asset value of our investment portfolio after the conclusion of each fiscal quarter in connection with the preparation of our annual and quarterly reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or more frequently if required under the 1940 Act.
Securities that are publicly traded are generally valued at the close price on the valuation date; however, if they remain subject to lock-up restrictions they are discounted accordingly. Securities that are not publicly traded or for which there are no readily available market quotations, including securities that trade on secondary markets for private securities, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors. In connection with that determination, members of GSV Asset Management’s portfolio management team will prepare portfolio company valuations using, when available, the most recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts. We also engage an independent valuation firm to perform independent valuations of our investments that are not publicly traded or for which there are no readily available market quotations. We may also engage an independent valuation firm to perform independent valuations of any securities that trade on private secondary markets, but are not otherwise publicly traded, where there is a lack of appreciable trading or a wide disparity in recently reported trades.
For those securities that are not publicly traded or for which there are no readily available market quotations, our Board of Directors, with the assistance of its valuation committee (the “Valuation Committee”), will use the recommended valuations as prepared by GSV Asset Management and the independent valuation firm, respectively, as a component of the foundation for its final fair value determination. Due to the uncertainty inherent in the valuation process, such estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the values that would have resulted had others made the determination using the same or different procedures or had a readily available market for the securities existed, and the differences could be material. Additionally, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the gains or losses implied by the valuation currently assigned to such investments. For those investments that are publicly traded, we generally record unrealized appreciation or depreciation based on changes in the market value of the securities as of the valuation date. Publicly traded securities that remain subject to lock-up restrictions are discounted accordingly. For those investments that are not publicly traded and for which there are no readily available market quotations, we record unrealized depreciation on such investments when we believe that an investment has become impaired and record unrealized appreciation if we believe that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and our equity security has also appreciated in value. Changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations as the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation.
7

TABLE OF CONTENTS

We generally determine the fair value of our investments by considering a number of factors. The following represent factors that, among others, could impact our fair value determinations:

1. | Public trading of our portfolio securities, taking into consideration lock-up requirements and liquidity;

​

2. | Active trading of our portfolio securities on a private secondary market, where we have determined that there is meaningful volume and the transactions are considered arm’s length by sophisticated investors;

​

3. | Qualified funding rounds in the companies in which we are invested, where there is meaningful and reputable information available on size, valuation and investors; and

​

4. | Additional investments by us in current portfolio companies, where the price of the new investment differs materially from prior investments.

​
There is inherent subjectivity in determining the fair value of our investments. In addition, we will accrue as a liability, each time we calculate net asset value, the amount we may owe GSV Asset Management for the income incentive fee and the capital gains incentive fee, the latter of which is based on the amount of unrealized and realized capital appreciation. We expect that most of our portfolio investments, other than those for which market quotations are readily available and that may be sold without restriction, will be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors, with the assistance of our Valuation Committee. Furthermore, when calculating net asset value, we also consider our recognition of a deferred tax liability for unrealized gains on investments for those investments held in our taxable subsidiaries. See “Note 1—Nature of Operations” to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 for a list of our taxable subsidiaries.
Investment Advisory Agreement
Management Services
GSV Asset Management serves as our investment adviser. Subject to the overall supervision of our Board of Directors, GSV Asset Management manages our day-to-day operations and provides us with investment advisory services. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Recent Developments” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.
Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, GSV Asset Management:

• | determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes;

​

• | determines what securities we will purchase, retain or sell;

​

• | performs due diligence on prospective portfolio companies;

​

• | identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make;

​

• | closes, monitors and services the investments we make; and

​

• | provides us with such other investment advisory, research and related services as we, from time to time, reasonably require for the investment of our funds.

​
GSV Asset Management’s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to us are not impaired. For example, as of April 17, 2019, GSV Asset Management also manages: Coursera@GSV Fund, LP, Coursera@GSV-EDBI Fund, LP, and GSV@CS, LP, special purpose vehicles each comprised of an underlying investment in the capital stock of Coursera, Inc. (the “Coursera Funds”); GSV@SP, LLC, a special purpose vehicle comprised of an underlying investment in the capital stock of Spotify Technology S.A. (the “GSV@SP Fund”); and GSV@LT, LLC, GSV@LT II, LP, and GSV@LT III, LP, special purpose vehicles each comprised of an underlying investment in the capital stock of Lyft, Inc. (the “Lyft Funds”). GSV Asset Management will likely manage one or more private funds, or series within such private funds, in the future. The Company has no ownership interests in the Coursera Funds, the GSV@SP Fund or the Lyft Funds.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The 1940 Act prohibits the Company from making certain negotiated co-investments with affiliates unless it receives an order from the SEC permitting it to do so. To the extent that the Company competes with entities managed by GSV Asset Management or any of its affiliates for one or more investment or disposition opportunities, GSV Asset Management will allocate any such opportunity across the entities for which the opportunity is appropriate, consistent with (1) its internal conflict-resolution and allocation policies, (2) the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and (3) certain restrictions under the 1940 Act regarding co-investments with affiliates. In situations where a particular investment or disposition opportunity is appropriate for both the Company and another entity managed by GSV Asset Management, even where co-investments are permissible under the 1940 Act, GSV Asset Management will first offer any such opportunity in its entirety to the Company. In the event that the size of such investment or disposition opportunity exceeds the Company’s capacity, other funds managed by GSV Asset Management may be offered the opportunity, but only to the extent that the Company and its Board of Directors have confirmed that any such investment or disposition by an affiliated entity is permissible under the 1940 Act and otherwise in the Company’s best interests. The Company’s Chief Compliance Officer and Board of Directors will monitor on a quarterly basis any such allocation of investment or disposition opportunities between the Company and any such other funds.
GSV Asset Management does not anticipate that it will ordinarily identify investment opportunities that are appropriate for both GSV Capital and the other funds that are currently or in the future may be managed by GSV Asset Management. However, to the extent it does identify such opportunity, GSV Asset Management will allocate any such opportunity across the entities for which the opportunity is appropriate, consistent with (1) its internal conflict-resolution and allocation policies, (2) the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and (3) certain restrictions under the 1940 Act regarding co-investments with affiliates.
We, GSV Asset Management, and certain of our affiliates have submitted an exemptive relief application to the SEC to permit us to co-invest with other funds managed by GSV Asset Management or its affiliates in a manner consistent with our investment objective and the conditions to the application. As a result of our Internalization, we and GSV Asset Management withdrew such exemptive application on April 2, 2019 because the relief sought was no longer necessary.
As a business development company, we are prohibited under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with certain of our affiliates without the prior approval of our Board of Directors, including the independent directors, and, in some cases, the SEC. The affiliates with which we may be prohibited from transacting include our officers, directors and employees and any person controlling or under common control with us, subject to certain exceptions.
Management Fees
We pay GSV Asset Management a fee for its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement consisting of two components — a base management fee and an incentive fee. 
Our base management fee compensates GSV Asset Management for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing and servicing our investments. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 2.00% of our gross assets, which is our total assets as reflected on our balance sheet (with no deduction for liabilities). Effective January 1, 2017 through January 31, 2018, however, pursuant to a voluntary waiver by GSV Asset Management, we paid GSV Asset Management a base management fee of 1.75%, a 0.25% reduction from the 2.00% base management fee payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. On February 2, 2018 GSV Asset Management voluntarily agreed to reduce fees payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement (the “Waiver Agreement”). Pursuant to the Waiver Agreement, effective February 1, 2018, the base management fee is reduced to 1.75% of the Company’s gross assets, as further described below. The waiver of a portion of the base management fee is not subject to recourse against or reimbursement by the Company.
The base management fee is payable monthly in arrears, and is calculated based on the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any equity or debt capital raises, repurchases or redemptions during the current calendar quarter. The base management fee for any partial month or quarter will be appropriately prorated.
Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, GSV Asset Management's incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and will equal the lesser of:

• | 20% of our realized capital gains during such calendar year, if any, calculated on an investment-by-investment basis, subject to a non-compounded preferred return, or “hurdle,” and a “catch-up” feature, and

TABLE OF CONTENTS


• | 20% of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fees.

Our realized capital gains from each investment, expressed as a non-compounded annual rate of return on the cost of such investment since we initially acquired it, will be compared to a hurdle rate of 8.00% per year. We will only pay an incentive fee on any realized capital gains from an investment that exceeds the hurdle rate. We will pay GSV Asset Management an incentive fee with respect to our realized capital gains from each investment as follows:

• | No incentive fee will be payable on the amount of any realized capital gains from an investment that, when expressed as a non-compounded annual rate of return on the cost of such investment since we initially acquired it, does not exceed the hurdle rate of 8.00% per year.


• | We will pay as an incentive fee 100% of the amount of any realized capital gains from an investment that, when expressed as a non-compounded annual rate of return on the cost of such investment since we initially acquired it, exceeds the hurdle rate of 8.00% per year but is less than a rate of 10.00% per year. We refer to this portion of our realized capital gains from each investment (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 10.00%) as the “catch-up.” The “catch-up” is meant to provide our investment adviser with 20% of the amount of our realized capital gains from an investment that, when expressed as a non-compounded annual rate of return on the cost of such investment since we initially acquired it, exceeds a rate of 10.00% per year.


• | We will pay as an incentive fee 20% of the amount of any realized capital gains from an investment that, when expressed as a non-compounded annual rate of return on the cost of such investment since we initially acquired it, exceeds a rate of 10.00% per year.

However, pursuant to the Waiver Agreement, certain high-water marks must be reached before any incentive fee is paid to GSV Asset Management under the Investment Advisory Agreement. In addition, in no event will we pay an incentive fee for any calendar year that exceeds 20% of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of such calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fees.
The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of our incentive fee under the Investment Advisory Agreement with respect to a single investment, assuming certain "High Water Marks" (detailed below) are met:
For accounting purposes, in order to reflect the theoretical capital gains incentive fee that would be payable for a given period as if all unrealized gains were realized, we are required to accrue a capital gains incentive fee based upon realized capital gains and losses during the current calendar year through the end of the period, plus any unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation as of the end of the period. It should be noted that a fee so calculated and accrued would not necessarily be payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement, and may never be paid based upon the computation of capital gains incentive fees in subsequent periods. Amounts paid under the Investment Advisory Agreement will be consistent with the formula reflected in the Investment Advisory Agreement, except as modified by the Waiver Agreement.
We seek to deploy capital primarily in the form of non-controlling investments in our portfolio companies. Although we primarily invest through private secondary markets, to the extent we make a direct minority investment in a portfolio company, 
10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

neither we, nor GSV Asset Management, may have the ability to control the timing of when we realize capital gains or losses with respect to such investment. We expect the timing of such realization events to be determined by our portfolio companies in such cases. To the extent we have non-minority investments, or the securities we hold are traded on a private secondary market or public securities exchange, GSV Asset Management will have greater control over the timing of a realization event. In such cases, our Board of Directors will monitor such investments in connection with their general oversight of the investment management services provided by GSV Asset Management. In addition, as of the end of each fiscal quarter, we will evaluate whether the cumulative aggregate unrealized appreciation on our portfolio would be sufficient to require us to pay an incentive fee to GSV Asset Management if such unrealized appreciation were actually realized as of the end of such quarter, and if so, we will accrue an expense equal to the amount of such incentive fee. Any such accrual of incentive fees will be reflected in the calculation of our net asset value.
In no event will we pay an incentive fee for any calendar year that exceeds 20% of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of such calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fees. See “Note 3—Related-Party Arrangements” to our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018 for details of incentive fees paid and accrued.
The cost of both the base management fee payable to GSV Asset Management, and any incentive fees earned by GSV Asset Management, are ultimately borne by our common stockholders. In aggregate, inclusive of accruals and reversals, GSV Asset Management earned $10,108,330 under the Investment Advisory Agreement during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. Refer to our Consolidated Statements of Operation as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 included in Part II, Item 6 of this report on Form 10-K for details of management and incentive fees earned and waived.
Waiver Agreement
On February 2, 2018, GSV Asset Management voluntarily agreed to reduce the fees payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement pursuant to the Waiver Agreement. The Waiver Agreement is effective February 1, 2018 and changes the fee structure set forth in the Investment Advisory Agreement by: (i) reducing our base management fee from 2.00% to 1.75%; and (ii) creating certain high-water marks that must be reached before any incentive fee is paid to GSV Asset Management. In addition to the foregoing changes to the fee structure, GSV Asset Management also agreed to a one-time forfeiture of $5.0 million of previously accrued but unpaid incentive fees.
Pursuant to the Waiver Agreement, effective February 1, 2018, the base management fee is reduced to 1.75% of gross assets. The base management fee is calculated based on the average value of gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any equity or debt capital raises, repurchases or redemptions during the current calendar quarter. The base management fee for any partial month or quarter will be appropriately prorated. In addition, because our 5.25% Convertible Senior Notes matured on September 15, 2018 (the "5.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018"), we were previously carrying a larger cash balance than we would in the ordinary course of business. As a result, under the Waiver Agreement, GSV Asset Management agreed to waive its base management fee on any cash balances effective as of February 1, 2018 until the 5.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 matured on September 15, 2018, at which time we repaid the remaining outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 5.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018, including accrued but unpaid interest. As a result, as of and after September 15, 2018, we pay GSV Asset Management a 1.75% base management fee on our cash balances.
Further, pursuant to the Waiver Agreement, in addition to the “hurdle” feature in the incentive fee, GSV Asset Management has agreed to additional conditions on its ability to receive an incentive fee. Specifically, the Waiver Agreement provides that an incentive fee earned by GSV Asset Management under the Investment Advisory Agreement will be payable to GSV Asset Management only if, at the time that such incentive fee becomes payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement, both our stock price and our last reported net asset value per share are equal to or greater than $12.55 (the “High-Water Mark”). The High-Water Mark is based upon the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of all our equity offerings since the initial public offering, less the dollar amount of all dividends paid by us since inception. Upon such time that the High-Water Mark is achieved, and GSV Asset Management is paid an incentive fee, a new High-Water Mark will be established. Each new High-Water Mark will be equal to the most recent High-Water Mark, plus 10%. Any High-Water Mark then in effect will be adjusted to reflect any dividends paid by us or any stock split effected by us.
In addition, as of December 31, 2018, the Company had accrued $4,660,472 in incentive fees that have not yet become payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement, inclusive of the $5.0 million GSV Asset Management has agreed to forfeit pursuant to the Waiver Agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

For the avoidance of doubt, after these changes take effect, under no circumstances will the aggregate fees earned by GSV Asset Management in any quarterly period be higher than those aggregate fees that would have been earned prior to the effectiveness of the Waiver Agreement.

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect from year to year if approved annually by our Board of Directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons of any such party, as such term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. The Investment Advisory Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon not more than 60 days’ written notice to the other. The Investment Advisory Agreement may also be terminated, without penalty, upon the vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities.
In connection with our Internalization, the Investment Advisory Agreement was terminated on the Effective Date in accordance with its terms. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Recent Developments” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.
Indemnification
The Investment Advisory Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, GSV Asset Management and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of GSV Asset Management’s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement or otherwise as our investment adviser.
Board Approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement
On April 9, 2018, at an in-person meeting, our Board of Directors, including a majority of the directors who were not “interested persons,” as defined by the 1940 Act, of the Company or GSV Asset Management, approved the continuation of the Investment Advisory Agreement to April 9, 2019. In its consideration of the re-approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Board of Directors focused on information it had received relating to, among other things:

• | the nature, quality and extent of the advisory and other services to be provided to us by GSV Asset Management;


• | the investment performance of GSV Asset Management;


• | comparative data with respect to advisory fees or similar expenses paid by other BDCs with similar investment objectives;


• | our projected operating expenses and expense ratio;


• | any existing and potential sources of indirect income to GSV Asset Management or GSV Capital Service Company from their relationships with us and the profitability of those relationships;


• | information about the services to be performed and the personnel performing such services under the Investment Advisory Agreement;


• | the organizational capability and financial condition of GSV Asset Management and its affiliates; and


• | the possibility of obtaining similar services from other third-party service providers or through an internally-managed structure.

​
Based on the information reviewed and related discussions, our Board of Directors concluded that fees payable to GSV Asset Management pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement were reasonable in relation to the services to be provided. The Board of Directors did not assign relative weights to the above factors or the other factors considered by it. In addition, our Board of Directors did not reach any specific conclusion on each factor considered, but rather, conducted an overall analysis of these factors. Individual members of the Board of Directors may have given different weights to different factors.
Administration Agreement
Under the Administration Agreement, GSV Capital Service Company performs, or oversees the performance of, our required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, GSV Capital Service Company assists us in determining and publishing our net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of our tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders, and generally overseeing the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. Further, pursuant to the Administration Agreement, GSV Capital Service Company furnishes us with office facilities, together with equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record-keeping services at such facilities.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Costs Incurred Under the Administration Agreement
Costs incurred under the Administration Agreement are based upon our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by GSV Capital Service Company in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including a portion of the rent and the compensation of our President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and other staff providing administrative services.
In accordance with the terms of the Administration Agreement, overhead and other administrative expenses are generally allocated between us and GSV Asset Management by reference to the relative time spent by personnel in performing administrative and similar functions on our behalf as compared to performing investment advisory or administrative functions on behalf of GSV Asset Management. To the extent personnel retained by GSV Capital Service Company perform administrative tasks for GSV Asset Management, the fees incurred with respect to the actual time dedicated to such tasks will be reimbursed by GSV Asset Management. While there is no limit on the total amount of expenses we may be required to reimburse to GSV Capital Service Company, our administrator will only charge us for the actual expenses it incurs on our behalf, or our allocable portion thereof, without any profit to GSV Capital Service Company.
GSV Asset Management wholly owns and controls GSV Capital Service Company, which is a disregarded entity for tax purposes.The Administration Agreement may be terminated at any time without penalty upon 60 days’ written notice, by a vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, by a vote of our Board of Directors or by GSV Capital Service Company.
In connection with our Internalization, the Administration Agreement was terminated on the Effective Date in accordance with its terms. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Recent Developments” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.
Indemnification
The Administration Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of their respective duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of their respective duties and obligations, GSV Capital Service Company and its officers, manager, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of GSV Capital Service Company’s services under the Administration Agreement or otherwise as our administrator.
License Agreement
We have entered into a license agreement with GSV Asset Management pursuant to which GSV Asset Management has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name “GSV.” Under this agreement, we have a right to use the GSV name for so long as the Investment Advisory Agreement with GSV Asset Management is in effect. Other than with respect to this limited license, we will have no legal right to the “GSV” name. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Recent Developments” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.
Regulation as a Business Development Company
General
A BDC is regulated by the 1940 Act. A BDC must be organized in the United States for the purpose of investing in, or lending to, primarily private companies and making significant managerial assistance available to them. A BDC may use capital provided by public stockholders and from other sources to make long-term, private investments in businesses. A BDC provides stockholders the ability to retain the liquidity of a publicly traded stock while sharing in the possible benefits, if any, of investing in primarily privately owned companies.
We may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC unless authorized by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities, as required by the 1940 Act. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of: (a) 67% or more of such company’s voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company. We do not anticipate any substantial change in the nature of our business.
14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

As with other companies regulated by the 1940 Act, a BDC must adhere to certain substantive regulatory requirements. A majority of our directors must be persons who are not “interested persons” as defined in the 1940 Act. Additionally, we are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect the BDC. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.
As a BDC, we are generally required to meet an asset coverage ratio, defined under the 1940 Act as the ratio of our gross assets (less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities) to our outstanding senior securities, of at least 200% after each issuance of senior securities. We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC.
The Small Business Credit Availability Act (the “SBCAA”) modifies the asset coverage percentage from 200% to 150%. Under the SBCAA, we are allowed to increase our leverage capacity if stockholders representing at least a majority of the votes cast, when a quorum is present, approve a proposal to do so. If we receive stockholder approval, we would be allowed to increase our leverage capacity on the first day after such approval. Alternatively, the SBCAA allows the majority of our independent directors to approve an increase in our leverage capacity, and such approval would become effective on the one-year anniversary of such approval. In either case, we would be required to make certain disclosures on our website and in SEC filings regarding, among other things, the receipt of approval to increase our leverage, our leverage capacity and usage, and risks related to leverage.
The SBCAA also instructs the SEC to issue rules or amendments to rules allowing BDCs to use the same securities offering and proxy rules that available to operating companies, including, among other things, allowing BDCs to incorporate by reference in registration statements filed with the SEC and allow certain BDCs to file shelf registration statements that are automatically effective and take advantage of other benefits available to Well-Known Seasoned Issuers; however, as of the date of this Form 10-K, we do not know when the rules relating to this legislation will become effective.
We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, except for registered money market funds, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of investment companies in the aggregate. The portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies ordinarily will subject our stockholders to additional indirect expenses. Our investment portfolio is also subject to diversification requirements by virtue of our election to be treated as a RIC for U.S. tax purposes and our intention to continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Structure” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for more information.
In addition, investment companies registered under the 1940 Act and private funds that are excluded from the definition of “investment company” pursuant to either Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act may not acquire directly or through a controlled entity more than 3% of our total outstanding voting stock (measured at the time of the acquisition), unless the funds comply with an exemption under the 1940 Act. As a result, certain of our investors may hold a smaller position in our shares than if they were not subject to these restrictions.
We are generally not able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Structure—Regulations governing our operation as a business development company affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital, which may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value of our common stock if our Board of Directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. In addition, we may generally issue new shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value in rights offerings to existing stockholders, in payment of dividends and in certain other limited circumstances.
As a BDC, we are also prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our Board of Directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. For example, under the 1940 Act, absent receipt of exemptive relief from the SEC, we and certain of our affiliates are generally precluded from co-investing in negotiated private placements of securities. We, GSV Asset Management and certain of our affiliates have submitted an exemptive application to the SEC to permit us to co-invest with other funds managed by GSV Asset Management or its affiliates in a manner consistent with our investment objective and the conditions to the application. There can be no assurance that this exemptive order will be granted. If such relief is granted, then we will be permitted to participate in co-investment transactions with certain of our affiliates if a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors makes certain conclusions in connection with each transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transaction, including 
15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies.
We are subject to periodic examination by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act.
As a BDC, we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Structure” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Qualifying Assets
Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as “qualifying assets”, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the BDC’s gross assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following:

1. | Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which:

​

a. | is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;

​

b. | is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and

​

c. | satisfies any of the following:

​

i. | does not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange;

​

ii. | has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250.0 million;

​

iii. | is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC and the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company;

​

iv. | is a small and solvent company having gross assets of not more than $4.0 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2.0 million; or

​

v. | meets such other criteria as may be established by the SEC.

​​

2. | Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control.

​

3. | Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.

​

4. | Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.

​

5. | Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in 1 through 4 above, or pursuant to the exercise of options, warrants or rights relating to such securities.

​

6. | Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.

​
16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

In addition, a BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above.
If at any time less than 70% of our gross assets are comprised of qualifying assets, including as a result of an increase in the value of any non-qualifying assets or decrease in the value of any qualifying assets, we would generally not be permitted to acquire any additional non-qualifying assets, other than office furniture and equipment, interests in real estate and leasehold improvements and facilities maintained to conduct the business operations of the BDC, deferred organization and operating expenses, and other noninvestment assets necessary and appropriate to its operations as a BDC, until such time as 70% of our then-current gross assets were comprised of qualifying assets. We would not be required, however, to dispose of any non-qualifying assets in such circumstances.
Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies
A BDC generally must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities it holds significant managerial assistance, except in circumstances where either (i) the BDC controls such issuer of securities or (ii) the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together and one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company.
Temporary Investments
Pending investment in other types of “qualifying assets,” as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our gross assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. GSV Asset Management will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions.
Warrants and Options
Under the 1940 Act, a BDC is subject to restrictions on the amount of warrants, options, restricted stock or rights to purchase shares of capital stock that it may have outstanding at any time. Under the 1940 Act, we may generally only offer warrants provided that (i) the warrants expire by their terms within ten years, (ii) the exercise or conversion price is not less than the current market value at the date of issuance, (iii) our stockholders authorize the proposal to issue such warrants, and our Board of Directors approves such issuance on the basis that the issuance is in the best interests of us and our stockholders and (iv) if the warrants are accompanied by other securities, the warrants are not separately transferable unless no class of such warrants and the securities accompanying them has been publicly distributed. The 1940 Act also provides that the amount of our voting securities that would result from the exercise of all outstanding warrants, as well as options and rights, at the time of issuance may not exceed 25% of our outstanding voting securities. In particular, the amount of capital stock that would result from the conversion or exercise of all outstanding warrants, options or rights to purchase capital stock cannot exceed 25% of the BDC’s total outstanding shares of capital stock.
Senior Securities
We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% (or 150% if certain requirements are met) immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our gross assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage.

Code of Ethics 
We and GSV Asset Management have adopted a joint code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act. This code establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain transactions by our personnel. Our code of ethics and our code of business conduct and ethics are available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC’s Internet site at http://www.sec.gov, and are available on our corporate governance. You may also obtain copies of our code of ethics and our code of business conduct and ethics, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following Email address: publicinfo@sec.gov.
Compliance Policies and Procedures
We and GSV Asset Management have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to detect and prevent violation of the federal securities laws and are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation and designate a Chief Compliance Officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures. Carl Rizzo currently serves as our Chief Compliance Officer.
Compliance with Corporate Governance Regulations
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example:

• | pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports;

​

• | pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures;

​

• | pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our management must prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and must obtain an audit of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting performed by our independent registered public accounting firm; and

​

• | pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.​

​
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.
In addition, the Nasdaq Capital Market has adopted various corporate governance requirements as part of its listing standards. We believe we are in compliance with such corporate governance listing standards. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all future listing standards and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith.
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to GSV Asset Management. The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of GSV Asset Management are set forth below. The guidelines will be reviewed periodically by GSV Asset Management and our non-interested directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change. For purposes of these Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures described below, “we,” “our” and “us” refer to GSV Asset Management.
Introduction
An investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act has a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of its clients, without regard to the investment adviser’s financial or other interest. As part of this duty, we recognize that we must vote client securities 
18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

in a timely manner, free of actual or apparent conflicts of interest and in the best interests of our clients (or, where the client is a pooled investment vehicle or other similar entity, the client’s equity interest holders (“stockholders”), viewed as a group rather than individually).
These policies and procedures for voting proxies for our investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act.
Proxy Policies
We will vote proxies relating to portfolio securities in what we perceive to be the best interests of our clients or, as applicable, their stockholders. We will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by our clients. Although we will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on our clients’ portfolio securities, we may vote for such a proposal if there are compelling long-term reasons to do so.
Our proxy voting decisions are made by the senior officers who are responsible for monitoring the relevant client’s investments. To ensure that our vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, we require that: (1) anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to our Chief Compliance Officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision-making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal without the prior approval of the Chief Compliance Officer and senior management in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties.
Proxy Voting Records
You may obtain information about how we voted proxies with respect to our portfolio securities by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Chief Compliance Officer, 345 California Street, Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94104 or compliance@gsvcap.com.
Privacy Principles
We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our stockholders and to safeguarding their non-public personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties.
Generally, we do not receive any non-public personal information relating to our stockholders, although certain non-public personal information of our stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any non-public personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders to anyone, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to service stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent or third-party administrator).
We restrict access to non-public personal information about our stockholders to employees of GSV Asset Management and its affiliates with a legitimate business need for the information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the non-public personal information of our stockholders.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
Included in our consolidated financial statements, the following wholly-owned subsidiaries are taxable subsidiaries (collectively, the “GSVC Holdings”), regardless of whether we qualify for tax treatment as a RIC: GSVC AE Holdings, Inc., GSVC AV Holdings, Inc., GSVC NG Holdings, Inc., GSVC SW Holdings, Inc., GSVC WS Holdings, Inc., and GSVC SVDS Holdings, Inc. The GSVC Holdings are C corporations for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. These taxable subsidiaries 
19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

are not consolidated for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expenses as a result of their ownership of the portfolio companies. Such income tax expenses and deferred taxes, if any, will be reflected in our consolidated financial statements.
We evaluate tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, in the course of preparing our consolidated financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. We recognize the tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only when the position has met the “more-likely-than-not” threshold. We classify penalties and interest associated with income taxes, if any, as income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, ongoing analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. We have identified our major tax jurisdictions as U.S. federal and California.
Election to be Taxed as a RIC
We elected to be treated as a RIC for the taxable year ended December 31, 2014 in connection with the filing of its 2014 tax return. As a result, the Company was required to pay a corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on the amount of the net built-in gains in its assets (the amount by which the net fair market value of the Company’s assets exceeds the net adjusted basis in its assets) either (1) as of the date it converted to a RIC (i.e., the beginning of the first taxable year that the Company qualifies as a RIC, which would be January 1, 2014), or (2) to the extent that the Company recognized such net built-in gains during the five-year recognition period beginning on the date of conversion. As of January 1, 2014, the Company had net unrealized built-in gains, but did not incur a built-in-gains tax for the 2014 tax year due to the fact that there were sufficient net capital loss carryforwards to completely offset recognized built-in gains as well as available net operating losses. The five-year recognition period ended on December 31, 2018.
We were taxed as a C corporation for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013. As a result of converting from a C corporation to a RIC, we are required to pay a corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on the net amount of the net built-in gains, if any, in our assets (i.e., the amount by which the net fair market value of our assets exceeds our net adjusted basis in our assets) as of the date of conversion (i.e., January 1, 2014) to the extent that such gains are recognized by us during the applicable five-year recognition period, which began on the date of conversion.
Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company
If we:

• | qualify as a RIC; and​


• | satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement,

​
then we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our income we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income, including capital gains not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders.
We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any ordinary income and net capital gains for preceding years that were not distributed during such preceding years (the “Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement”). We generally will endeavor in each year to make sufficient distributions to our stockholders to avoid any U.S. federal excise tax on our earnings.
In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:

• | have in effect an election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year;


• | derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to loans of certain securities, gains from the sale of stock or other securities or foreign currencies, net income from certain “qualified publicly traded partnerships,” or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities (the “90% Income Test”);


• | distribute to our stockholders on a timely basis each year at least 90% of “investment company taxable income,” which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses (the “Annual Distribution Requirement”). and

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS


• | diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:

​

• | at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer (the “50% Diversification Test”); and

​

• | no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses, or of certain “qualified publicly traded partnerships” (the “25% Diversification Test,” and together with the 50% Diversification Test, the “Diversification Tests”).

​
If we satisfy the Diversification Tests as of the close of any quarter, we will not fail the Diversification Tests as of the close of a subsequent quarter as a consequence of a discrepancy between the value of our assets and the requirements of the Diversification Tests that is attributable solely to fluctuations in the value of our assets. Rather, we will fail the Diversification Tests as of the end of a subsequent quarter only if such a discrepancy existed immediately after our acquisition of any asset and such discrepancy is wholly or partly the result of that acquisition. In addition, if we fail the Diversification Tests as of the end of any quarter, we will not lose our status as a RIC if we eliminate the discrepancy within thirty days of the end of such quarter and, if we eliminate the discrepancy within that thirty-day period, we will be treated as having satisfied the Diversification Tests as of the end of such quarter for purposes of applying the rule described in the preceding sentence, assuming that it is not the first quarter of RIC qualification.
Any corporate-level built-in gain tax is payable at the time the built-in gains are recognized (which generally will be the years in which the built-in gain assets are sold in a taxable transaction). The amount of this tax will vary depending on the assets that are actually sold by us in the applicable period, the amount of realized gain (loss), the actual amount of net built-in gain or loss present in those assets as of the date of conversion, and the effective tax rates at such times. The payment of any such corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on built-in gain will be an expense that will reduce the amount available for distribution to our stockholders. The built-in gain tax is calculated by determining a RIC’s net unrealized built-in gains, if any, by which the fair market value of the assets of the RIC at the beginning of the first RIC-year exceeds the aggregate adjusted basis of such assets at that time.
We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (which may arise if we receive warrants in connection with the origination of a loan or possibly in other circumstances), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as contractual payment-in-kind, or PIK, interest (which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance and due at the end of the loan term) or dividends and deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock. Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement and the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount.
We will be subject to certain asset coverage ratio requirements under the 1940 Act and financial covenants under loan and credit agreements that could, under certain circumstances, restrict us from making distributions necessary to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement. See “—Regulation as a Business Development Company—Senior Securities.” Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous.
Certain of our investment practices may be subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things: (i) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions; (ii) convert lower taxed long-term capital gain into higher taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary income; (iii) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited); (iv) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash; (v) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of securities is deemed to occur; (vi) adversely alter 
21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

the characterization of certain complex financial transactions; and (vii) produce income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test described above. We will monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections in order to mitigate the potential adverse effect of these provisions.
Gain or loss realized by us from the sale or exchange of warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. The treatment of such gain or loss as long-term or short-term will depend on how long we held a particular warrant. Upon the exercise of a warrant acquired by us, our tax basis in the stock purchased under the warrant will equal the sum of the amount paid for the warrant plus the strike price paid on the exercise of the warrant.
Failure to Maintain our Qualification as a RIC
If we fail to satisfy the 90% Income Test or the Diversification Tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless continue to qualify as a RIC for such year if certain relief provisions are applicable (which may, among other things, require us to pay certain corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes or to dispose of certain assets).
If we were unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC and the foregoing relief provisions are not applicable, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates, regardless of whether we make any distributions to our stockholders. Distributions would not be required, and any distributions would be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income that, subject to certain limitations, may be eligible for the 20% maximum rate to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits provided certain holding period and other requirements were met. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder’s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. To requalify as a RIC in a subsequent taxable year, we would be required to satisfy the RIC qualification requirements for that year and dispose of any earnings and profits from any year in which we failed to qualify as a RIC. Subject to a limited exception applicable to RICs that qualified as such under Subchapter M of the Code for at least one year prior to disqualification and that requalify as a RIC no later than the second year following the nonqualifying year, we could be subject to tax on any unrealized net built-in gains in the assets held by us during the period in which we failed to qualify as a RIC that are recognized within the subsequent five years, unless we made a special election to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on such built-in gain at the time of our requalification as a RIC.
Tax matters are complicated and the tax consequences to an investor of an investment in our common stock will depend on the facts of his, her or its particular situation. We encourage investors to consult their own tax advisers regarding the specific consequences of such an investment, including tax reporting requirements, the applicability of federal, state, local and foreign tax laws, eligibility for the benefits of any applicable tax treaty and the effect of any possible changes in the tax laws.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Structure” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K and “Note 2—Significant Accounting Policies—U.S. Federal and State Income Taxes” and “Note 9—Income Taxes” to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 for further detail.
