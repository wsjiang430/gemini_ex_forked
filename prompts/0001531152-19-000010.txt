Item 1. Business
General
BJ’s Wholesale Club is a leading warehouse club operator on the east coast of the United States. We deliver significant value to our members, consistently offering 25% or more savings on a representative basket of manufacturer-branded groceries compared to traditional supermarket competitors. We provide a curated assortment focused on perishable products, continuously refreshed general merchandise, gasoline and other ancillary services to deliver a differentiated shopping experience, that is further enhanced by our omnichannel capabilities.
Over the last three years, we have hired Chris Baldwin as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and have made multiple senior management hires and changes, adding consumer packaged goods, digital and consulting experience to our leadership team. This new leadership team has implemented significant cultural and operational changes to our business, including transforming how we use data to improve member experience, instilling a culture of cost discipline, adopting a more proactive approach to growing our membership base and building an omnichannel offering oriented towards making shopping at BJ's more convenient. These changes have delivered results rapidly, evidenced by positive comparable club sales over the last six quarters and net income growth of over 150% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 8% in aggregate form from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2018. In fiscal year 2018, we generated total revenues, net income and Adjusted EBITDA of $13.0 billion, $127.3 million and $578.4 million, respectively.
Since pioneering the warehouse club model in New England in 1984, we have grown our footprint to 216 large-format, high volume warehouse clubs spanning 16 states. In our core New England markets, which have high population density and generate a disproportionate part of U.S. GDP, we operate almost three times the number of clubs of the next largest warehouse club competitor. In addition to shopping in our clubs, members are able to shop when and how they want through our website, www.bjs.com; our highly-rated mobile app and our integrated Instacart same-day delivery offering.
Our goal is to offer our members significant value and a meaningful return, in savings, on their annual membership fee. We have approximately 5.5 million members paying annual fees to gain access to savings on groceries, consumables, general merchandise, gas and ancillary services. The annual membership fee for our Inner Circle® Membership is $55 per year, and our BJ’s Perks Rewards® Membership, which offers additional value-enhancing features, costs $110 annually. We believe that members can save over ten times their $55 Inner Circle membership fee versus what they would have paid at traditional supermarket competitors when they spend $2,500 or more per year at BJ’s on manufacturer-branded groceries. In addition to providing significant savings on a representative basket of manufacturer-branded groceries, we accept all manufacturer coupons and also carry our own exclusive brands that enable members to save on price without compromising on quality. Our two private label brands, Wellsley Farms® and Berkley Jensen®, represent over $2 billion in sales, and are the largest brands we sell. Our customers recognize the relevance of our value proposition across economic environments, as demonstrated by over 20 consecutive years of membership fee income growth. Our membership fee income was $282.9 million for fiscal year 2018 and represents approximately half of our Adjusted EBITDA.
Our Clubs
As of February 2, 2019, we operated 216 clubs ranging in size from 63,000 square feet to 150,000 square feet. We aim to locate our larger clubs in high density, high traffic locations that are difficult to replicate. We design our smaller format clubs to serve markets whose population is not sufficient to support a larger club or that are in locations, such as urban areas, where there is inadequate real estate space for a larger club. Including space for parking, the amount of land required for a BJ’s club generally ranges from 8 acres to approximately 14 acres. The use of garage parking can in some cases reduce the amount of land necessary for a club. Our clubs are located in both free-standing locations and shopping centers.
We buy most of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to cross-docking consolidation points (distribution centers) or directly to our clubs. Our company-operated and contracted distribution centers receive large shipments from manufacturers and quickly ship these goods to individual clubs. This process creates freight volume and handling efficiencies, eliminating many costs associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels.

Industry Overview
Warehouse clubs offer a relatively narrow assortment of food and general merchandise items within a wide range of product categories. In order to achieve high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover, merchandise selections are generally limited to items that are brand name leaders in their categories alongside an assortment of private label brands. Since warehouse clubs sell a diversified selection of product categories, they attract customers from a wide range of other wholesale and retail distribution channels, such as supermarkets, supercenters, internet retailers, gasoline stations, hard discounters, department and specialty stores and operators selling a narrow range of merchandise. These higher cost distribution channels have traditionally been unable to match the low prices offered by warehouse clubs over long periods. 
Warehouse clubs eliminate many of the merchandise handling costs associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels by purchasing full truckloads of merchandise directly from manufacturers and by storing merchandise on the sales floor rather than in central warehouses. By operating no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, warehouse clubs have fixturing and operating costs substantially below those of traditional retailers. Because of their higher sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover, warehouse clubs generate cash from the sale of a large portion of their inventory before they are required to pay merchandise vendors. As a result, a greater percentage of the inventory is financed through vendor payment terms than by working capital. Two broad groups of customers, individual households and small businesses, have been attracted to the savings made possible by the high sales volumes and operating efficiencies achieved by warehouse clubs. Customers at warehouse clubs are generally limited to members who pay an annual fee. 
Merchandising
We service our existing members and attract new members by providing a broad range of high quality, brand name and private label merchandise at prices that are consistently lower than the prices of traditional retailers, including discount retailers, supermarkets, supercenters and specialty retail operations. We limit the items offered in each product line to fast selling styles, sizes and colors, carrying approximately 7,200 active stock keeping units (SKUs). By contrast, supermarkets normally carry an average of 40,000 SKUs, and supercenters may stock 100,000 SKUs or more. We work closely with manufacturers to develop packaging and sizes that are best suited for selling through the warehouse club format in order to minimize handling costs and ensure value to our members.

We group our merchandise offerings into perishables, edible grocery, non-edible grocery and general merchandise categories. 

• | Perishables: consist of our meat, produce, dairy, bakery, deli and frozen products, and constituted approximately 32% of our merchandise sales for fiscal year 2018.


• | Edible grocery: consists of packaged foods (including breakfast foods, salty snacks and candy) and beverages (including juices, water, beer, wine and liquor) and constituted approximately 27% of our merchandise sales for fiscal year 2018.


• | Non-edible grocery: consists of detergents, disinfectants, paper products, beauty care, adult and baby care and pet foods, and constituted approximately 25% of our merchandise sales for fiscal year 2018.


• | General merchandise: consists of small appliances, televisions, electronics, seasonal goods and apparel and constituted approximately 16% of our merchandise sales for fiscal year 2018.

BJ’s consumer-focused private label products, sold under Wellsley Farms® and Berkley Jensen® brands, comprised approximately 20% of total merchandise sales in fiscal year 2018, compared to 10% of total merchandise sales in fiscal year 2012. These products are primarily premium quality and generally are priced below the branded competing product. We focus both on a group of core private label products that compete with national brands that have among the highest market share and yield high margins and on differentiated products that drive member loyalty. 
We also offer a number of specialty services that are designed to enable members to complete more of their shopping at our clubs and to encourage more frequent trips to the clubs. Many of these services are provided by outside operators under license from us. Specialty services include full-service optical centers; tire installation services; a propane tank filling service; home improvement services; travel services; an automobile buying service; a car rental service; garden and storage sheds; patios and sunrooms; payment processing services; and product protection plans.
As of February 2, 2019, we had 138 gasoline stations in operation at or near our clubs. The gas stations are generally self-service, with some locations also accepting cash. Both regular and premium gasoline are available. We generally maintain our gas prices below the average prices in each market as a means of illustrating a favorable price image to existing and prospective members. 
Omnichannel Offering
Our e-commerce business, www.bjs.com, provides hundreds of our general merchandise products as well as thousands of additional products generally not found in our clubs. We provide delivery of these products to our members’ home or office. Items sold on our website include electronics, computers, office supplies and equipment, products for the home, health and beauty aids, sporting goods, outdoor living, baby products, toys and jewelry. In addition, we offer, through third party providers, services such as tire installation, travel and insurance and more. In addition to e-commerce capabilities, our highly-rated mobile app offers Add-to-Card Coupons functionality, which alleviates the hassle of paper coupons by allowing members to digitally save our own and national brand coupons and offers directly onto the app, and Express Scan capability, which enables our members to self-checkout by scanning purchases on their smartphone. We have also rolled out an integrated same-day delivery offering with club pricing and a fixed delivery fee.
Membership
Paid membership is an essential element of the warehouse club concept. In addition to providing a source of revenue which permits us to offer low prices, membership reinforces customer loyalty. We have a large base of approximately 5.5 million paid memberships as of fiscal year 2018. Our target customers care about value, quality and convenience and shop at warehouse clubs for their family needs. Our target customers are a price sensitive demographic with large household sizes, representing the largest segment of warehouse club shoppers in BJ’s trade areas, with 9 million households and $7 billion of annual club channel grocery spend. While we believe we also appeal to a wider range of household incomes, we target households with an average annual income of approximately $75,000. We believe this group represents a historically underserved demographic in our core markets. 
We offer two core types of memberships: Inner Circle® memberships and business memberships. We generally charge $55 per year for a primary Inner Circle membership that includes one additional card for a household member. Primary members may purchase up to three supplemental memberships for $30 each. A primary business membership costs $55 per year and includes one free supplemental membership. Business members may purchase up to eight additional supplemental business memberships at $30 each. U.S. military personnel—active and veteran—who enroll at a BJ’s club location can do so for a reduced membership fee. We had approximately 5.5 million paid members at February 2, 2019.

BJ’s Perks Rewards®, our higher tier of membership, offers members the opportunity to earn 2% cash back on most in-Club and www.bjs.com purchases. The annual fee for a BJ’s Perks Rewards Membership is $110 per year. We also offer our co-branded My BJ’s Perks® Mastercard® credit cards. These cards provide members with the opportunity to earn up to 5% cash back on purchases made at our clubs or online at www.bjs.com and a 10-cent per gallon discount on gasoline when paying with a My BJ’s Perks Mastercard at our BJ’s Gas locations. We offer among the most competitive gasoline prices in our markets, evidenced by GasBuddy naming BJ’s Gas among the top 10 on its 100 U.S. Best Value Brands for 2016. Since fiscal year 2014, we have grown co-branded Mastercard holders by 421%. In fiscal year 2018, BJ’s Perks Rewards members and co-branded Mastercard members accounted for 23% of members and 39% of spend. 
Advertising and Public Relations
We promote customer awareness of our clubs primarily through social media, direct mail, public relations efforts, radio advertising, community involvement, new club marketing programs and various publications sent to our members periodically throughout the year. We also employ dedicated marketing personnel who solicit potential business members and who contact other selected organizations to increase the number of members. We also run free promotional membership and initially discounted membership promotions to attract new members, with the objective of converting them to paid members. These programs result in low marketing expenses compared to typical retailers.
Club Operations
Our ability to achieve profitable operations depends upon high sales volumes and the efficient operation of our warehouse clubs. We buy most of our merchandise from manufacturers for shipment either to a BJ’s cross-dock facility or directly to our clubs. This eliminates many of the costs associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels, including distributors’ commissions and the costs of storing merchandise in central distribution facilities.
We route the majority of our purchases through cross-dock facilities which break down truckload quantity shipments from manufacturers and reallocates these goods for shipment to individual clubs, generally within 24 hours. Our efficient distribution systems result in reduced freight expenses and lower handling costs compared to other retailers. We contract with a third party that operates three perishables distribution centers for us.
We work closely with manufacturers to minimize the amount of handling required once merchandise is received at a club. Merchandise for sale is generally displayed on pallets containing large quantities of each item, thereby reducing labor required for handling, stocking and restocking. Back-up merchandise is generally stored in steel racks above the sales floor.
Information Systems
We strive to use information systems and technology to improve the control and the efficiency of our business model. We completed an implementation of SAP enterprise resource planning software in fiscal year 2015 and are focused on leveraging the efficiency benefits of SAP as well as implementing new checkout technologies to improve member convenience.
Competition
We compete with a wide range of national, regional and local retailers and wholesalers selling food and/or general merchandise in our markets, including supermarkets, supercenters, general merchandise chains, specialty chains, gasoline stations and other warehouse clubs, some of which have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than BJ’s. Major competitors that operate warehouse clubs include Costco Wholesale Corporation and Sam’s Clubs (a division of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.), both of which operate on a multi-national basis.
We believe price is the major competitive factor in the markets in which we compete. Other competitive factors include store location, merchandise selection, member services and name recognition. We believe our efficient, low-cost form of distribution gives us a significant competitive advantage over more traditional channels of retail distribution.
Intellectual Property
We believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, patents, trade dress, domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important to our success. We have invested significantly in the development and protection of our well-recognized brands, including our private label brands, Wellsley Farms® and Berkley Jensen®. We believe that products sold under our private label brands are high quality, offered to our members at prices that are generally lower than those for comparable national brand products and help lower costs, differentiate our merchandise offerings from other retailers and generally earn higher margins. We expect to continue to increase the sales penetration of our private label items.

We rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality, license and other agreements with our suppliers, employees and others to protect our intellectual property rights. The availability and duration of trademark registrations vary by country; however, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and their registrations are properly maintained.
Government Regulation
We are subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing truth-in-advertising, privacy laws, environmental laws, safety regulations and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that regulate retailers and govern the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of clubs, warehouses and Company-operated and contracted distribution center facilities.
Our clubs are also subject to various local, state and federal laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business. We must comply with provisions regulating health and sanitation standards, food labeling, equal employment, minimum wages, environmental protection, licensing for the sale of food and, in many clubs, licensing for beer and wine or other alcoholic beverages. Our operations, including the manufacturing, processing, formulating, packaging, labeling and advertising of products are subject to regulation by various federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the FTC, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the “CPSC”) and the Environmental Protection Agency. We rely on contractual provisions to ensure compliance by our vendors.
Food
The FDA has comprehensive authority to regulate the safety of food and food ingredients (other than meat, poultry, catfish and certain egg products), as well as dietary supplements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”). Similarly, the USDA’s Food Safety Inspection Service is the public health agency responsible for ensuring that the nation’s commercial supply of meat, poultry, catfish and certain egg products is safe, wholesome and correctly labeled and packaged under the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry Products Inspection Act.
Congress amended the FDCA in 2011 through passage of the Food Safety Modernization Act (the “FSMA”), which greatly expanded the FDA’s regulatory obligations over all actors in the supply chain. Industry actors continue to determine the best pathways to implement FSMA’s regulatory mandates and the FDA’s promulgating regulations throughout supply chains, as most requirements are now in effect. Such regulations mandate that risk-based preventive controls be observed by the majority of food producers. This authority applies to all domestic food facilities and, by way of imported food supplier verification requirements, to all foreign facilities that supply food products.
The FDA also exercises broad jurisdiction over the labeling and promotion of food. Labeling is a broad concept that, under certain circumstances, extends even to product-related claims and representations made on a company’s website or similar printed or graphic medium. All foods, including dietary supplements, must bear labeling that provides consumers with essential information with respect to standards of identity, net quantity, nutrition facts labeling, ingredient statement and allergen disclosures. The FDA also regulates the use of structure/function claims, health claims and nutrient content claims.
Dietary Supplements
The FDA has comprehensive authority to regulate the safety of dietary supplements, dietary ingredients, labeling and current good manufacturing practices. Congress amended the FDCA in 1994 through passage of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (the “DSHEA”), which greatly expanded FDA’s regulatory authority over dietary supplements. Through DSHEA, dietary supplements became their own regulated commodity while also allowing structure/function claims on products. However, no statement on a dietary supplement may expressly or implicitly represent that it will diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent a disease.
Food and Dietary Supplement Advertising
The FTC exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of foods and dietary supplements. The FTC has the power to institute monetary sanctions and the imposition of consent decrees and penalties that can severely limit a company’s business practices. In recent years, the FTC has instituted numerous enforcement actions against dietary supplement companies for failure to have adequate substantiation for claims made in advertising or for the use of false or misleading advertising claims.

Compliance
As is common in our industry, we rely on our suppliers and contract manufacturers, including those of our private label products, to ensure that the products they manufacture and sell to us comply with all applicable regulatory and legislative requirements. We do not directly manufacture any goods. In general, we seek certifications of compliance, representations and warranties, indemnification or insurance from our suppliers and contract manufacturers. However, even with adequate insurance and indemnification, any claims of non-compliance could significantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in products we sell. In addition, the failure of such products to comply with applicable regulatory and legislative requirements could prevent us from marketing the products or require us to recall or remove such products from our clubs. In order to comply with applicable statutes and regulations, our suppliers and contract manufacturers have from time to time reformulated, eliminated or relabeled certain of their products, and we have revised certain provisions of our sales and marketing program.
We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws.
Seasonality
Our business is moderately seasonal in nature. Historically, our business has realized a slightly higher portion of net sales, operating income and cash flows from operations in the second and fourth fiscal quarters, attributable primarily to the impact of the summer and year-end holiday season, respectively.
Employees
As of February 2, 2019, we had approximately 26,383 full-time and part-time employees, whom we refer to as "team members". None of our team members is represented by a union. We consider our relations with our team members to be good.
Segments
Our club retail operations, which represent substantially all of our consolidated total revenues, are our only reportable segment. All of our identifiable assets are located in the United States. We do not have significant sales outside the United States, nor does any customer represent more than 10% of total revenues for any period presented. 
Corporate Information
Our principal operating subsidiary is BJ’s Wholesale Club, Inc., which was previously an independent publicly traded corporation until its acquisition on September 30, 2011, by a subsidiary of Beacon Holding Inc., a company incorporated on June 24, 2011 by the Sponsors for the purpose of the acquisition. BJ’s Wholesale Club Holdings, Inc. changed its name from Beacon Holding Inc. on February 23, 2018.
