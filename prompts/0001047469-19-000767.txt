     ITEM 1.    BUSINESS 
  Basis of Presentation 
         As previously reported in our filings with the SEC, we have undertaken strategic reviews of our global portfolio and have announced plans to divest certain of our subsidiaries as part of a strategic shift. This strategic shift will have a significant effect on our operations and financial results. Accordingly, as a result of the strategic shift announced in August 2018, we account for all of the divestitures that are currently part of this strategic shift as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Unless otherwise indicated, the information in or incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K, including our segment information, relates only to our continuing operations. 
 Strategic Developments 
         As announced previously, we have reviewed our global portfolio of institutions with the goals of simplifying and focusing our operations, reducing complexity, mitigating risks (such as political, regulatory, economic and currency), exiting smaller markets where our operations have less scale and maximizing our exposure to what we believe are the most attractive and scalable markets for our network. We have undertaken a series of divestitures calculated to simplify and streamline our business. In 2017, we announced the divestiture of certain subsidiaries in our then-existing Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific ("EMEAA") and Central America & U.S. Campuses segments. On August 9, 2018, we announced that we plan to divest additional subsidiaries located in Europe, Asia and Central America, which were included in the then-existing EMEAA, Andean & Iberian, and Central America & U.S. Campuses segments. As of September 30, 2018, we refer to the EMEAA segment as our "Rest of World" segment and to the Andean & Iberian segment as our "Andean" segment. We have decided to focus principally on the Latin American markets where we operate large-scale platforms, as well as on the online market in the United States. 
 General 
         We are the largest international network of degree-granting higher education institutions, primarily focused in Latin America, with approximately 875,000 students enrolled at over 25 institutions with more than 150 campuses, which we collectively refer to as the Laureate International Universities network. The institutions in the Laureate International Universities network are leading brands in their respective markets and offer a broad range of undergraduate and graduate degrees through campus-based, online and hybrid programs. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 93% of our students attend traditional, campus-based institutions offering multi-year degrees, similar to leading private and public higher education institutions in developed markets such as the United States and Europe. Nearly two thirds of our students are enrolled in programs of four or more years in duration. 
         Our programs are designed with a distinct emphasis on applied, professional-oriented content for growing career fields and are focused on academic disciplines that we believe offer strong employment opportunities and high earnings potential for our students. We continually and proactively adapt our curriculum to the needs of the market. In particular, we emphasize science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) and business disciplines, areas in which we believe that there is large and growing demand, especially in developing countries. Since 2009, we have more than doubled our enrollment of students pursuing degrees in Medicine & Health Sciences, Engineering & Information Technology and Business & Management, our three largest disciplines. We believe the work of our graduates in these disciplines creates a positive impact on the communities we serve and strengthens our institutions' reputations within their respective markets. Our focus on private-pay and our track record for delivering high-quality outcomes to our students, while stressing affordability and accessibility, has been a key reason for our long record of success. 
 4

           We believe the global higher education market presents an attractive long-term opportunity, primarily because of the large and growing imbalance between the supply and demand for affordable, quality higher education in many parts of the world. We believe the combination of the projected growth in the middle class, limited government resources dedicated to higher education, and a clear value proposition demonstrated by the higher earnings potential afforded by higher education, creates substantial opportunities for high-quality private institutions to meet this growing and unmet demand. By offering high-quality, outcome-focused education, we believe that we enable students to prosper and thrive in the dynamic and evolving knowledge economy. 
         We operate institutions that address regional, national and local supply and demand imbalances in higher education. As the international leader in higher education, we believe we are uniquely positioned to deliver high-quality education across different brands and tuition levels in the markets in which we operate. In many developing markets, traditional higher education students (defined as 18-24 year olds) have historically been served by public universities, which have limited capacity and are often underfunded, resulting in an inability to meet growing student demands and employer requirements. Our institutions in these markets offer traditional higher education students a private education alternative, often with multiple brands and price points in each market, with innovative programs and strong career-driven outcomes. In many of these same markets, non-traditional students such as working adults and distance learners have limited options for pursuing higher education. Through targeted programs and multiple teaching modalities, we are able to serve the differentiated needs of this unique demographic. 
         Our program and level of study mix for 2018 was as follows: 

   
Program Mix | Level of Study Mix 
Based on 12/31/2018 total enrollments | Based on 12/31/2018 total enrollments High school students are primarily in Mexico


        The Laureate International Universities network enables us to educate our students locally while connecting them to an international community and offering them the advantages of our shared infrastructure, technology, curricula and operational best practices. For example, our students can take advantage of shared curricula, optional international programs and services, including English language instruction, dual-degree programs and other benefits offered by other institutions in our network. We believe that the benefits of the network translate into better career opportunities and higher earnings potential for our graduates. 
   Our Segments 
         We have five reportable segments, which are summarized in the charts below. We group our institutions by geography in Brazil, Mexico, Andean and Rest of World for reporting purposes. Our 
 5

   Online & Partnerships segment principally consists of Walden University. The following information for our segments is presented as of December 31, 2018. 

     Our Industry 
         We operate in the international market for higher education, which is characterized by a significant imbalance between supply and demand, especially in developing economies. In many countries, demand for higher education is large and growing. GSV Advisors ("GSV") estimates that higher education institutions accounted for total revenues of approximately $1.5 trillion globally in 2015, with the higher education market expected to grow by approximately 5% per annum through 2020. Global growth in higher education is being fueled by several demographic and economic factors, including a growing middle class, global growth in services and technology-related industries and recognition of the significant personal and economic benefits gained by graduates of higher education institutions. At the same time, many governments have limited resources to devote to higher education, resulting in a diminished ability by the public sector to meet growing demand, and creating opportunities for private education providers to enter these markets and deliver high-quality education. As a result, the private sector plays a large and growing role in higher education globally. While the Laureate International Universities network is the largest international network of degree-granting higher education institutions in the world, our total enrollment at December 31, 2018 of approximately 875,000 students represents only 0.4% of worldwide higher education students. 
  Large, Growing and Underpenetrated Population of Qualified Higher Education Students.    According to United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ("UNESCO"), 220 million students worldwide were enrolled in higher education institutions in 2016, more than double the 100.2 million students enrolled in 2000, and approximately 90% of those students were enrolled at institutions outside of the United States. In many countries, including throughout Latin America and other developing regions, there is growing demand for higher education based on favorable demographics, increasing secondary completion rates and increasing higher education participation rates, resulting in continued growth in higher education enrollments. While global participation rates have increased for traditional higher education students (defined as 18-24 year olds), the market for higher education is still significantly underpenetrated, particularly in developing countries. For example, participation rates in Brazil and Mexico in 2016 were approximately 36% and approximately 28%, respectively, as compared to approximately 63% in the United States for the same period. 
 6

    Strong Economic Incentives for Higher Education.    According to the Brookings Institution, approximately 3.2 billion people in the world composed the middle class in 2016, a number that is expected to be over five billion people by 2028. We believe that members of this large and growing group seek advanced education opportunities for themselves and their children in recognition of the vast differential in earnings potential with and without higher education. According to 2015 data from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD"), in the United States and European Union countries that are members of the OECD, the earnings from employment for an adult completing higher education were approximately 74% and approximately 53% higher, respectively, than those of an adult with only an upper secondary education. This income gap is even more pronounced in many developing countries around the world, including a differential of approximately 149% in Brazil, and approximately 102% in Mexico. We believe the cumulative impact of favorable demographic and socio-economic trends, coupled with the superior earnings potential of higher education graduates, will continue to expand the market for private higher education. 
         Increasing Role of the Private Sector in Higher Education.    In many of our markets, the private sector plays a meaningful role in higher education, bridging supply and demand imbalances created by a lack of capacity at public universities. In addition to capacity limitations, we believe that limited public resources, and the corresponding policy reforms to make higher education systems less dependent on the financial and operational support of local governments, have resulted in increased enrollments in private institutions relative to public institutions. For example, Brazil relies heavily upon private institutions to deliver quality higher education to students, with approximately 74% (in 2015) of higher education students in Brazil enrolled in private institutions. 
         Favorable Industry Dynamics in Key Latin American Markets.    In the large Latin American markets in which we operate, many of the industry trends described above are even more prevalent, with strong growth in higher education over the past 15 years.

        Increasing Demand for Online Offerings.    The acceptance of online learning in higher education is well-established, as evidenced by a survey conducted by the Babson Survey Research Group that reported that approximately 71% of academic leaders rated online learning outcomes as the same or superior to classroom learning in 2014. We believe that increasing student demand (for example, students taking at least one distance education course made up approximately 30% of all higher education enrollments in the United States as of the second half of 2015 according to the Distance Education Enrollment Report 2017), new instruction methodologies designed for the online medium, and growing employer and regulatory acceptance of degrees obtained through online and hybrid modalities will continue to drive online learning growth globally. Moreover, increasing the percentage of courses taught online in a hybrid educational model has significant cost and capital efficiency benefits as a greater number of students can be accommodated in existing physical campus space. 
 7

           Growth in Outsourced Academic and Administrative Services.    To adapt to changing student preferences and greater demand for online and distance learning solutions, university leaders are refocusing their strategies around core academic functions, while seeking to outsource specialized technology functions and other administrative services. Private sector partners offering operational expertise and economies of scale are increasingly assisting universities through long-term relationships in areas such as online program management, technology support, facilities management, student services and procurement. According to a survey conducted by Inside Higher Ed in 2017, approximately 27% of college business officers in the United States believe that outsourcing more administrative services is a strategy they will implement in 2017-2018. We believe that these trends will increase opportunities for private sector partners to deploy their capabilities to traditional educational providers. 
   Our Strengths and Competitive Advantages 
         We believe our key competitive strengths that will enable us to execute our strategy include the following: 
  Scaled Platform Institutions Across Our Network.    Our scale facilitates distinct advantages for our students and allows us to leverage our operating model across our network more efficiently. It would take a competitor considerable time and expense to establish a network of international universities of similar scale with the high-quality brands, intellectual property and accreditations that we possess. 
         Our network facilitates competitive advantages related to: 
 

 Curricula and Programs.  We are able to leverage our curricula and resources
across our international network, allowing for the rapid deployment of new programs in our markets. Increasing amounts of our curricula are being standardized across our network, allowing us to lower
the cost of program development by reusing and sharing content, while improving the quality of our programs. For example, the resources and support of our international network enabled the rapid
expansion of our medicine and health sciences offerings, contributing to the opening of eight new medical schools since 2010 and increasing enrollment in the number of students pursuing degrees in the
fields of medicine and health sciences from approximately 50,000 students in 2009 to more than 225,000 students as of December 31, 2018. We are also able to utilize our network to provide
innovative offerings to our students, such as international joint and dual degree programs. 
 Best Practices.  Through collaboration across our network, best practices
for key operational processes, such as campus design, faculty training, student services and recruitment are identified and then rolled out to the institutions in our network. 
 Unified Systems.  Our scale also permits increased investment in unified
technology systems and an opportunity to leverage standardization of processes, centralization of common services (such as information technology, finance and procurement) and intellectual property,
and implementing a common operating model and platform for content development, digital campus experiences, student services, recruitment and administrative services across our network. We believe
this operating leverage positions us well for enhanced growth in profitability and cash flow relative to our enrollments and revenue. 

         In particular, the scale of our business in the markets in Latin America in which we operate confers a competitive advantage, in that we are well-positioned to leverage our scale across these large markets that are relatively homogeneous in many ways (e.g., language, geography and regulatory environments). We are creating a common operating model for our network institutions that integrates multiple software components, including SaaS-based information technology capabilities, student information system ("SIS"), enterprise resource planning ("ERP"), learning management system ("LMS"), and customer relationship management ("CRM"), into a single unified platform. We 
 8

   anticipate that implementation of the common operating model in these markets will create additional operational leverage that can be deployed not just at a brand or institution level, but more broadly across Brazil, Chile, Peru and Mexico. 
  Leading Intellectual Property and Technology.    We have developed an extensive collection of intellectual property that has in part been enabled by investments in unified technology systems. We believe this collection of intellectual property, including online capabilities, campus management, faculty training, curriculum design and quality assurance, among other proprietary solutions, provides our students a truly differentiated learning experience and creates a significant competitive advantage for our institutions over competitors. We have made significant investments to create unified technology systems across our network. These systems will provide data and insights on a scale that we believe will allow us to improve student experience, retention rates and outcomes, while also enabling a more efficient and lower cost educational delivery model. 
         Long-Standing and Respected University Brands.    We believe we have established a reputation for providing high-quality higher education in the countries in which we operate, and many of our institutions are among the most respected higher education brands in their local markets. Many of our institutions have over 50-year histories and are ranked among the best in their respective countries. For example, Universidade Anhembi Morumbi in Brazil is ranked by Guia do Estudante as one of São Paulo's top universities, UVM Mexico, the largest private university in Mexico, was ranked seventh among all public and private higher education institutions in that country by Guía Universitaria, an annual publication of Reader's Digest, Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas ("UPC") recently attained a 4-Star Rating from QS Stars, making it the only 4-Star Rated university in that country, and Universidad Andrés Bello in Chile is ranked by SCImago among the five best universities in the country. 
         Many of our institutions and programs have earned the highest accreditation available, which provides us with a strong competitive advantage in local markets. For example, medical school licenses are often the most difficult to obtain and are only granted to institutions that meet rigorous standards. We serve more than 225,000 students in the fields of medicine and health sciences across more than 100 campuses throughout the Laureate International Universities network, including 20 medical schools and 15 dental schools. We believe the existence of medical schools at many of our institutions further validates the quality of our institutions and programs and increases brand awareness. 
  Commitment to Academic Quality.    We offer high-quality undergraduate, graduate and specialized programs in a wide range of disciplines that generate strong interest from students and provide attractive employment prospects. Our commitment to quality is demonstrated by, for example, the fact that our Brazilian institutions' IGC scores (an indicator used by the Brazilian Ministry of Education ("MEC") to evaluate the quality of higher education institutions) have increased by more than 30% on average from 2010 to 2017, placing four of our institutions in the top quarter, and all of our students in Brazil enrolled in institutions ranked in the top third, of all private higher education institutions in the country. We focus on programs that prepare our students to become employed in high demand professions. Our curriculum development process includes employer surveys and ongoing research into business trends to determine the skills and knowledge base that will be required by those employers in the future. This information results in timely curriculum upgrades, which helps ensure that our graduates acquire the skills that will make them marketable to employers. We are also committed to continually evaluating our institutions to ensure we are providing the highest quality education to our students. Our proprietary management tool, the Laureate Education Assessment Framework ("LEAF"), is used to evaluate institutional performance based on 44 unique criteria across five different categories: Employability, Learning Experience, Personal Experience, Access & Outreach and Academic Excellence. LEAF, in conjunction with additional external assessment methodologies, such as 
 9

   QS Stars, allows us to identify key areas for improvement in order to drive a culture of quality and continual innovation at our institutions. 
  Strong Student Outcomes.    We track and measure our student outcomes to ensure we are delivering on our commitments to students and their families. In 2017, we commissioned a study by Kantar Vermeer, a leading third-party market research organization, of graduates at Laureate institutions representing over 65% of total Laureate enrollments. Graduates at 10 of our 12 surveyed international institutions achieved, on average, equal or higher employment rates within 12 months of graduation as compared to graduates of other institutions in the same markets. In addition, in 10 of the 12 institutions surveyed, graduates achieved equal or higher starting salaries as compared to graduates of other institutions in those same markets (salary premium to market benchmarks ranged from approximately 15% to approximately 47%). Furthermore, a joint study by Laureate and the IFC/World Bank Group in 2014 showed that graduates of Laureate institutions in Mexico experienced higher rates of social mobility, finding jobs, and moving up in socioeconomic status than their peers in non-Laureate institutions. In 2016, we conducted a similar study with the IFC in Peru for two of our network institutions, UPC and Cibertec, which showed that graduates from the larger programs of both institutions had higher salaries than their control group counterparts. Additionally, graduates from UPC were found to experience a larger positive change in their socioeconomic status than their peers who completed studies at non-Laureate institutions. 
 


Attractive Financial Model. 

 Private Pay Model.  Approximately 71% of our total revenues for the year
ended December 31, 2018 were generated from private pay sources. We believe students' and families' willingness to allocate personal resources to fund higher education at our institutions
validates our strong value proposition. 
 Revenue Visibility Enhanced by Program Length and Strong Retention.  The
length of our programs provides us with a high degree of revenue visibility. The majority of the academic programs offered by our institutions last between three and five years, and nearly two thirds
of our students were enrolled in programs of at least four years or more in duration as of December 31, 2018. Additionally, we actively monitor and manage student retention because of the
impact it has on student outcomes and our financial results. The historical annual student retention rate, which we define as the proportion of prior year students returning in the current year
(excluding graduating students), of over 80% has not varied by more than three percentage points in any one year over the last five years. Given our high degree of revenue visibility, we are able to
make attractive capital investments and execute other strategic initiatives to help drive sustainable growth in our business. 
 Attractive Margin Profile with Significant Operating Leverage.  Our
international network of universities provides significant advantages of scale, enabling us to operate efficiently with attractive margin levels by leveraging the scale of our network. In 2014, we
launched our first Excellence in Process ("EiP") enterprise-wide initiative to optimize and standardize our processes to enable sustained growth and
margin expansion. Given the success of the first wave of EiP, we have expanded the initiative into other back- and mid-office areas, as well as certain student-facing activities, in order to generate
additional efficiencies and create a more efficient organizational structure. Our EiP programs have implemented vertical integration of procurement, information technology, finance, accounting, and
human resources, enabling us to fully leverage the growing size and scope of our local operations while also enhancing our internal controls and have expanded to leveraging additional opportunities
for efficiencies and savings related to the mid-office functions (including, for example, student information systems and the enrollment-to-graduation cycle) as well as general and administrative
structure and certain student-facing activities. 

 10

     Our Strategy 
         The execution of our strategy will be enabled by the following initiatives: 
  Integration of Latin American Campus-Based Operations Through Common Operating Model.    We anticipate that our focus on our core, scaled markets will allow us to integrate our campus-based operations in those markets. Our institutions in Latin America serve approximately 800,000 students in a relatively homogenous operating environment, creating a unique opportunity to harvest the benefits of scale. We believe that by implementing and optimizing our common operating model, we will be able to transition our institutions from operating as decentralized, stand-alone units to operating as an integrated and scaled network. 
         Tighter integration of our Latin American campus-based operations will also enable us to significantly reduce our cost structure and allow us to leverage the benefits of our scale across our more than 20 brands in these markets. By continuing to build on our success with the implementation of EiP, we believe that we can increase consistency and achieve scale with respect to back and mid-office functions, as well as certain front-office functions which impact the student from enrollment through graduation. 
         We anticipate that the common operating model will enable closer collaboration across our network and will facilitate network-wide innovation and improved student experiences, such as joint program development initiatives, global classrooms, increased sharing of best practices and additional coordinated investments in unified technology systems and new capabilities such as artificial intelligence ("AI") and enhanced data analytics. We believe that this unification will enable us to be more nimble in our day-to-day operations and will allow us to extract valuable insights from more data across our network. We believe this will enable further innovation and efficiency in our academic model and operations. Further, we believe that this common operating system will enable us to lower the cost of delivery of education, which we believe should lead to improved margins and expanded market share. We plan to continue to centralize the development of certain curriculum, allowing us to build common teaching modules and courses at a lower cost and at higher quality, as compared to building modules and courses in each local market, as we can dedicate more resources to each course or module. 
  Leverage and Expand Existing Portfolio.    We will continue to focus on opportunities to expand our programs and the type of students that we serve, as well as our capacity in our markets to meet local demand, leveraging our existing platform to execute on attractive organic growth opportunities. In particular, we intend to add new programs and course offerings, expand target student demographics and, where appropriate, increase capacity at existing campuses, open new campuses and enter new cities in existing markets. We believe these initiatives will drive growth and provide an attractive return on capital. 
 

 Add New Programs and Course Offerings.  We will continue to develop new
programs and course offerings to address the changing needs in the markets. New programs and course offerings enable us to provide a high-quality education that we believe is desired by students and
prospective employers. 
 Expand Target Student Demographics.  We use sophisticated analytical
techniques to identify opportunities to provide quality education to new or underserved student populations where market demand is not being met, such as non-traditional students (e.g., working
adults) who may value flexible scheduling options, as well as traditional students. Our ability to provide quality education to these underserved markets has provided additional growth opportunities
to our network and we intend to leverage our management capabilities and local knowledge to further capitalize on these opportunities in new and existing markets. 
 Increase Capacity at Existing and New Campus Locations.  We will continue to
make demand-driven investments in additional capacity throughout our network by expanding existing 

 11

   

campuses
and opening new campuses, including in new cities. We employ a highly analytical process based on economic and demographic trends, and demand data for the local market to determine when and
where to expand capacity. When opening a new campus or expanding existing facilities, we use best practices that we have developed over more than the past decade to cost-effectively expedite the
opening and development of that location. 


  Expand Online and Hybrid Education Programs.    We intend to increase the number of our students that receive their education through fully online or hybrid programs to meet the growing demands of students. Our online initiative is designed to not only provide students with access to innovative programs and modern digital experiences, but also to diversify our offerings, increase our enrollments and expand our digital solutions in a capital efficient manner, leveraging current infrastructure and improving classroom utilization. 
         For 2018, the percentage of student credit hours taken online in our campus-based institutions was approximately 24%, an increase from approximately 11% in 2015. With a common LMS implemented throughout our network covering approximately 98% of our students as of December 31, 2018, scaling up to 100% during the first half of 2019, we believe we have the scale to execute on this market opportunity, allowing us to differentiate ourselves further from our competitors. 
         We continue to accelerate the advancement of online education programs and technology-enabled solutions that deliver high-quality differentiated student experiences for our institutions at scale, including leveraging our network-wide launch of OneCampus® by Laureate, our global online campus.  OneCampus® brings global connections, opportunities, courses, and workplace experiences to our students, who become "members" in the broader Laureate network of institutions and gain access to unique global opportunities online. Furthermore, it creates a channel for Laureate to manage online initiatives across the network and continually expand our portfolio of online offeringsreaching students, faculty, and alumni in the Laureate network and offering them a distinct market advantage. 
         Our strategy for the online opportunity includes the following components: 
 

 Hybrid Online Programs.  Traditional 18-24 year old students
attending campus-based institutions are increasingly seeking digital learning experiences that are blended with in-person learning. We provide those students with a hybrid learning experience, mixing
face-to-face classroom experience with technology through our online platform, which we believe improves the student experience by providing them with a wide range of online courses, interactive
discussions, virtual experiences, digital resources, and simulations that enhance their learning experiences both within and outside the classroom. 
 Fully Online Programs.  Many students require flexible learning modules to
accommodate work and personal responsibilities. Often, these students are working adults who are looking to either complete an undergraduate or post-graduate degree, or who want to gain a credential
to accelerate or change careers. Our fully online programs provide students with a high-quality curriculum experience to achieve their goals. 
 Distance Learning in Brazil.  The Brazil market offers a unique opportunity
to provide a quality and at-scale distance learning offering. The distance learning format reduces the need for on-site support, providing students with flexibility to plan their studies. With an
established presence of over 400 active learning centers and nearly 1,000 polo licenses as of December 31, 2018, we have continued to leverage
our local brands in Brazil to capitalize on our investment in distance learning centers to support demand.

     Competition 
         We face competition in each of our operating segments. We believe competition focuses on price, educational quality, reputation, location and facilities. 
   Brazil, Mexico, Andean and Rest of World 
         The market for higher education outside the United States is highly fragmented and marked by large numbers of local competitors. The target demographics are primarily 18- to 24-year-olds in the individual countries in which we compete. We generally compete with both public and private higher education institutions on the basis of price, educational quality, reputation and location. Public institutions tend to be less expensive, if not free, but more selective and less focused on practical programs aligned around career opportunities. We believe we compare favorably with competitors because of our focus on quality, professional-oriented curriculum and the competitive advantages provided by our network. At present, we believe no other company has a similar network of international institutions. There are a number of other private and public institutions in each of the countries in which we operate. Because the concept of private higher education institutions is fairly new in many countries, it is difficult to predict how the markets will evolve and how many competitors there will be in the future. We expect competition to increase as the markets mature. 
 United States 
         The postsecondary education market is highly competitive, with no private or public institution holding a significant market share. We compete primarily with public and private degree-granting regionally accredited colleges and universities. Our competitors include both traditional and proprietary colleges and universities offering online programs. Traditional colleges and universities increasingly offer a variety of distance education alternatives to professional adults. Competition from traditional colleges and universities is expected to increase as they expand their online offerings. 
         We believe that the competitive factors in the postsecondary education market primarily include the following:
 

 relevant, high-quality and accredited program offerings; 
 reputation of the college or university and marketability of the degree; 
 flexible, convenient, and dependable access to programs and courses; 
 regulatory approvals; 
 qualified and experienced faculty; 
 level of learner support; 
 affordability of the program; 
 availability of Title IV funds; 
 marketing and recruiting effectiveness; and 
 the time necessary to earn a degree. 

 Online & Partnerships 
         The market for fully online higher education is highly fragmented and competitive, with no single institution having any significant market share. The target demographic for Walden University is adult working professionals who are over 25 years old. Walden University competes with traditional public and private nonprofit institutions and for-profit schools. In recent years, the competition for online 
 15

   enrollments has increased as more traditional campus-based institutions are becoming online-enabled. Typically, public institutions charge lower tuitions than Walden University because they receive state subsidies, government and foundation grants, and tax-deductible contributions and have access to other financial sources not available to Walden University. However, tuition at private nonprofit institutions is typically higher than the average tuition rates charged by Walden University. Walden University competes with other educational institutions principally based upon price, educational quality, reputation, location, educational programs and student services. 
         See "Item 1ARisk FactorsRisks Relating to Our BusinessThe higher education market is very competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively." 
   Recent Developments 
   Sale of Spanish and Portuguese Institutions 
         On December 12, 2018, Iniciativas Culturales de España S.L., a Spanish private limited liability company ("ICE"), and Laureate I B.V., a Netherlands private limited liability company ("Laureate I"), both of which are indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") with Samarinda Investments, S.L., a Spanish limited liability company (the "Purchaser"). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Purchaser will purchase from ICE all of the issued and outstanding shares in the capital of each of Universidad Europea de Madrid, S.L.U., Iniciativas Educativas de Mallorca, S.L.U., Iniciativa Educativa UEA, S.L.U., Universidad Europea de Canarias, S.L.U., and Universidad Europea de Valencia, S.L.U. (together, the "Spain Companies"), and the Purchaser will purchase from Laureate I all of the issued and outstanding shares in the capital of EnsilisEducação e Formação, Unipessoal, Lda. (the "Portugal Company"). Three of the Spain Companies are the entities that operate Universidad Europea de Madrid, Universidad Europea de Canarias, and Universidad Europea de Valencia. The Portugal Company is the entity that operates Universidade Europeia, a comprehensive university in Portugal, and Instituto Português de Administração de Marketing (IPAM Lisbon and IPAM Porto), post-secondary schools of marketing in Portugal. 
         The transaction value under the Agreement is €770 million (or approximately $878 million at the December 31, 2018 rate of exchange), subject to customary closing adjustments, and the parties expect that the transaction will close within the first half of 2019, subject to customary closing conditions, including approvals by applicable competition and education regulatory authorities. For the 12-month period ended September 30, 2018, the Spain Companies and the Portugal Company, both of which are accounted for by the Company as discontinued operations, collectively had approximately $251.5 million in revenue, $46.2 million in operating income and $12.0 million in depreciation and amortization and, as of September 30, 2018, collectively had approximately 23,000 students. 
   Closing of Sale of University of St. Augustine for Health Sciences 
         As previously reported, on April 24, 2018, the Company, and Exeter Street Holdings, LLC (the "Seller") and University of St. Augustine for Health Sciences, LLC ("USAHS"), both of which are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") with University of St. Augustine Acquisition Corp. (the "Purchaser"), an affiliate of Altas Partners LP, to purchase from the Seller all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of USAHS. On February 1, 2019, the transaction contemplated by the Agreement was completed following the required regulatory approvals. Upon completion of the sale, the Seller received net proceeds of $346.4 million, which includes $11.7 million of closing adjustments, net of $58.1 million debt assumed by the Purchaser and fees of $7.2 million. The Company used $340 million of the net proceeds to repay a portion of its U.S. term loan, with the remaining $6.4 million in proceeds utilized to repay borrowings outstanding under its revolving line of credit.

     Amendment of Agreement to Sell Institution in Malaysia 
         As previously reported, on December 11, 2017, Exeter Street Holdings Sdn. Bhd., a Malaysia corporation (the "Seller"), and Laureate Education Asia Limited, a Hong Kong corporation (the "Guarantor"), both of which are indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, entered into a Share Sale & Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") with Comprehensive Education Pte. Ltd., a Singapore corporation (the "Purchaser") that is an affiliate of Affinity Equity Partners, a private equity firm based in Hong Kong. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Purchaser agreed to purchase from the Seller all of the issued and outstanding shares in the capital of Inti Education Holdings Sdn. Bhd., a Malaysia corporation ("Inti Holdings"), and the Guarantor agreed to guarantee certain obligations of the Seller. Inti Holdings is the indirect owner of INTI University and Colleges, higher education institutions with five campuses in Malaysia ("INTI"). In connection with the Agreement, the Seller entered into a separate agreement with the current minority owner of the equity of Inti Holdings relating to the purchase by the Seller of the minority owner's 10.10% interest in Inti Holdings, the closing of which is a precondition to the closing of the transactions under the Agreement. The total purchase price, including the payment to the current minority owner, would have been US$180.0 million. The net transaction value to the Company under the Agreement would have been US$161.8 million, subject to customary closing adjustments. 
         The closing of the transaction under the Agreement was subject to certain conditions, including approval by regulators in Malaysia within a prescribed period, which approval has not been obtained. On January 17, 2019, the parties agreed to amend the Agreement to provide additional time for the Purchaser to obtain all required regulatory approvals. As part of that amendment, the parties agreed to reduce the total purchase price to US$140.0 million, which would result in a net transaction value to the Company of US$125.86 million, subject to customary closing adjustments. The parties now expect the transaction to close in the first half of 2019. 
   Sale of Institution in Thailand 
         On February 12, 2019, LEI Singapore Holdings Pte. Ltd., a Singapore corporation (the "Seller"), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Laureate I B.V., a Netherlands corporation (the "Seller Guarantor"), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Share Sale & Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") with China YuHua Education Investment Limited, a British Virgin Islands corporation (the "Purchaser"), and China YuHua Education Corporation Limited, a Cayman Islands corporation (the "Purchaser Guarantor"). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Purchaser purchased from the Seller all of Seller's interests in the issued share capital of Thai Education Holdings Company Limited, a Thailand corporation ("TEDCO"), and in Far East Stamford International Co Ltd ("FES"), a Thailand corporation, and to arrange the assignment of certain amounts receivable from the Thai group, the Seller Guarantor agreed to guarantee certain obligations of the Seller under the Agreement, and the Purchaser Guarantor agreed to guarantee certain obligation of the Purchaser under the Agreement. TEDCO is the owner of a controlling interest in FES, which is the license holder for Stamford International University, a member of the Laureate International Universities network with three campuses in Thailand. The total purchase price to the Seller under the Agreement was approximately $35.3 million, and net proceeds to the Seller were approximately $27.9 million, net of $7.1 million of net debt assumed by the Purchaser and $0.3 million of other customary closing adjustments. The transaction closed on the same date. Of the $27.9 million in net proceeds, the Seller received $23.7 million at closing. The balance of $4.2 million will be payable on the satisfaction of certain post-closing requirements. For the 12-month period ended December 31, 2018, TEDCO, FES and Stamford International University, which are accounted for by the Company as discontinued operations, collectively had approximately $20.0 million in revenue, an operating loss of $0.4 million, and $1.4 million in depreciation and amortization and, as of December 31, 2018, had approximately 4,400 students.

     Intellectual Property 
         We currently own, or have filed applications for, trademark registrations for the word "Laureate," for "Laureate International Universities" and for the Laureate leaf logo in the trademark offices of all jurisdictions around the world where we operate institutions of higher learning. We have also registered or filed applications in the applicable jurisdictions where we operate for the marks "Laureate Online International" and "Laureate Online Education." In addition, we have the rights to trade names, logos, and other intellectual property specific to most of our higher education institutions, in the countries in which those institutions operate. 
 Employees 
         As of December 31, 2018, including discontinued operations, we had approximately 60,000 employees, of which approximately 6,000 were full-time academic teaching staff and 21,000 were part-time academic teaching staff. In addition, we have approximately 200 part-time academic teaching staff who are classified as contractors, principally in Chile and Brazil. Our employees at many of our institutions outside the United States are represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements, as is customary or required under local law in those jurisdictions. At various points throughout the year, we negotiate to renew collective bargaining agreements that have expired or that will expire in the near term. We consider ourselves to be in good standing with all of the labor unions of which our employees are members and believe we have good relations with all of our employees. 
 Effect of Environmental Laws 
         We believe we are in compliance with all applicable environmental laws, in all material respects. We do not expect future compliance with environmental laws to have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 Our History 
         We were founded in 1989 as Sylvan Learning Systems, Inc., a provider of a broad array of supplemental and remedial educational services. In 1999, we made our first investment in global higher education with our acquisition of Universidad Europea de Madrid, and in 2001 we entered the market for online delivery of higher education services in the United States with our acquisition of Walden University. In 2003, we sold the principal operations that made up our then K-12 educational services business and certain venture investments deemed not strategic to our higher education business, and in 2004 we changed our name to Laureate Education, Inc. In August 2007, we were acquired in a leveraged buyout by a consortium of investment funds and other investors. On February 6, 2017, we consummated our initial public offering ("IPO") and shares of our Class A Common Stock began trading on the Nasdaq under the symbol "LAUR". 
 Public Benefit Corporation Status 
         In October 2015, we redomiciled in Delaware as a public benefit corporation as a demonstration of our long-term commitment to our mission to benefit our students and society. Public benefit corporations are a relatively new class of corporations that are intended to produce a public benefit and to operate in a responsible and sustainable manner. Under Delaware law, public benefit corporations are required to identify in their certificate of incorporation the public benefit or benefits they will promote and their directors have a duty to manage the affairs of the corporation in a manner that balances the pecuniary interests of the stockholders, the best interests of those materially affected by the corporation's conduct, and the specific public benefit or public benefits identified in the public benefit corporation's certificate of incorporation. Public benefit corporations organized in Delaware are 
 18

   also required to assess their benefit performance internally and to disclose publicly at least biennially a report detailing their success in meeting their benefit objectives. 
         Our public benefit, as provided in our certificate of incorporation, is: to produce a positive effect (or a reduction of negative effects) for society and persons by offering diverse education programs delivered online and on premises operated in the communities that we serve. By doing so, we believe that we provide greater access to cost-effective, high-quality higher education that enables more students to achieve their academic and career aspirations. Most of our operations are outside the United States, where there is a large and growing imbalance between the supply and demand for quality higher education. Our stated public benefit is firmly rooted in our company mission and our belief that when our students succeed, countries prosper and societies benefit. Becoming a public benefit corporation underscores our commitment to our purpose and our stakeholders, including students, regulators, employers, local communities and stockholders. 
   Certified B Corporation 
         While not required by Delaware law or the terms of our certificate of incorporation, we have elected to have our social and environmental performance, accountability and transparency assessed against the proprietary criteria established by an independent non-profit organization. As a result of this assessment, we have been designated as a "Certified B CorporationTM" under the standards set by an independent organization, which refers to companies that are certified as meeting certain levels of social and environmental performance, accountability and transparency. 
         The following description of the certification processes and standards was provided to us by the independent organization that designated us as a Certified B Corporation. The first step in becoming a Certified B Corporation is taking and passing a comprehensive and objective assessment of a business's positive impact on society and the environment. The assessment varies depending on the company's size (number of employees), sector and location. The standards in the assessment are created and revised by an independent governing body that determines eligibility to be a Certified B Corporation. 
         By completing a set of over 200 questions, which are customized for the company being assessed, that reflect impact indicators, best practices and outcomes, a company receives a composite score on a 200-point scale representative of its overall impact on its employees, customers, communities and the environment. Representative indicators in the assessment range from payment above a living wage, employee benefits, charitable giving/community service, use of renewable energy and, in the case of educational institutions like Laureate, student outcomes such as retention, graduation and employment rates. 
         Certification as a Certified B Corporation requires that a company achieve a reviewed assessment score of at least an 80. The review process includes a phone review, a random selection of indicators for verifying documentation and a random selection of company locations for onsite reviews, including employee interviews and facility tours. In the case of Laureate's assessment, each subsidiary, as well as the corporate office in Baltimore, was required to complete an individual assessment for review that would be aggregated based on size to calculate an overall score. The assessment also includes a disclosure questionnaire, including any sensitive practices, fines and sanctions related to the company or its partners. 
         For Laureate, certification also required us to adopt the public benefit corporation structure, a step we have already completed. Once certified, every Certified B Corporation must make its assessment score transparent on the independent non-profit organization's website. Acceptance as a Certified B Corporation and continued certification is at the sole discretion of the independent organization. 
         On January 22, 2018, Laureate was recertified as a Certified B Corporation by the independent third party.

 Industry Regulation 
   Australian Regulation
        We operate two post-secondary educational institutions in AustraliaTorrens University Australia Ltd ("Torrens") and Think: Colleges Pty Ltd ("Think"). 
         In Australia a distinction is made between higher education organizations and vocational education. 
         Higher education providers consist of public and private universities, Australian branches of overseas universities and other higher education providers. Higher education qualifications consist of undergraduate awards (bachelor degrees, associate degrees and diplomas) and postgraduate awards (graduate certificates and diplomas, master's degrees and doctoral degrees). The regulation of higher education providers is undertaken at a national level by the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency ("TEQSA"). All organizations that offer higher education qualifications in or from Australia must be registered by TEQSA. Higher education providers that have not been granted self-accrediting status must also have their courses of study accredited by TEQSA. Registration as a higher education provider is for a fixed period of up to seven years. TEQSA regularly reviews the conduct and operation of accredited higher education providers. 
         The vocational education and training ("VET") sector consists of technical and further education institutes, agricultural colleges, adult and community education providers, community organizations, industry skill centers and private providers. VET qualifications include certificates, diplomas and advanced diplomas. The regulation of VET providers is undertaken at a national level by the Australian Skills Quality Authority ("ASQA"). Organizations providing VET in Australia must be registered by ASQA as a Registered Training Organisation. Courses offered by Registered Training Organisations need to be accredited by ASQA. Registration as a registered training organization is for a fixed period of up to seven years. ASQA regularly reviews the conduct and operations of registered training organizations. 
         Torrens is one of 43 universities in Australia. It is a for-profit entity and registered as a university by TEQSA and has applied to renew its registration. As a self-accrediting university it is not required to have its courses of study accredited by TEQSA. Torrens is also registered by ASQA as a Registered Training Organisation and is thus entitled to offer vocational and training courses. 
         Think is one of approximately 5,000 Registered Training Organisations in Australia and in that capacity is regulated by ASQA. It is also registered as a higher education provider by TEQSA. Its higher education courses require, and have received, accreditation by TEQSA. 
         Australia also maintains a Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students ("CRICOS") for Australian educational providers that recruit, enroll and teach overseas 
 20

   students. Registration in CRICOS allows providers to offer courses to overseas students studying on Australian student visas. Both Torrens and Think are so registered. 
         The Commonwealth government has established income-contingent loan schemes that assist eligible fee-paying students to pay all or part of their tuition fees (separate schemes exist for higher education and vocational courses). Under the schemes the relevant fees are paid directly to the institutions. A corresponding obligation then exists from the participating student to the Commonwealth government. Neither Torrens nor Think have any responsibility in connection with the repayment of these loans by students and, generally, this assistance is not available to international students. Both Torrens and Think are registered for the purposes of these plans (a precondition to their students being eligible to receive these loans). 
   Brazilian Regulation
        The Brazilian educational system is organized according to a system of cooperation among federal, state and local governments. Higher education (i.e., undergraduate and graduate level education provided by public and private higher education institutions ("HEI")) is regulated primarily at the federal level, particularly in terms of public policy goals, accreditation and academic oversight. The legislative influence of state and municipal governments is generally restricted to taxation, real estate and operational permitting issues. 
         With respect to the federal role, The National Educational Basis and Guidelines Law ("LDB"), provides the general framework for the provision of educational services in Brazil and establishes the duty of the federal government to:
 

 coordinate the national educational policy; 
 ensure national process of evaluation of higher education institutions, with the cooperation of evaluation agencies that have responsibility
for this level of education; and to create an evaluation process for the academic performance of elementary, secondary and higher education in collaboration with educational institutions in order to
improve the quality of education; and 
 issue rules and regulations regarding higher education. 

         The responsibility of the federal government in regulating, monitoring and evaluating higher education institutions and undergraduate programs is exercised by the Ministry of Education ("MEC"), along with a number of other federal agencies and related offices. 
   MEC 
         MEC is the highest authority of the higher education system in Brazil and has the power to issue implementing rules (regulations, notices, and technical advisories governing the conduct of higher education), as well as to regulate and monitor the higher education segment. 
         By exercising its duties, MEC has the power to confirm decisions from the National Board of Education ("CNE") regarding the accreditation and reaccreditation of institutions of higher education, as well as legal opinions and regulatory proposals coming from the Board. MEC is also responsible for validating the criteria and methodology employed by the National Institute of Educational Studies Anísio Teixeira ("INEP"). 
   CNENational Board of Education 
         CNE is a consultative advisory and deliberative body of MEC. It consists of the Board of Basic Education and the Board of Higher Education, each composed of 12 members appointed by the President of Brazil. The Board of Higher Education has the power to (i) analyze and issue opinions on the results of higher education quality assessment; (ii) deliberate on the reports submitted by MEC on 
 21

   programmatic accreditation and qualifications offered by higher education institutions, as well as on prior authorization from those offered by non-university institutions; and (iii) approve the accreditation and periodic reaccreditation of higher education institutions, based on official reports and quality assessments. 
         The CNE is also responsible for matters relating to the implementation of higher education norms and advising MEC on related matters. 
   INEPNational Institute of Educational Studies Anísio Teixeira 
         INEP is a federal agency linked to MEC that is the primary statistical and information-gathering body for the entire Brazilian education system. The performance data it collects and publishes is used by MEC, the legislature and the rest of the executive branch, as well as the public, to debate and make policy and programmatic decisions about education. INEP is responsible for the National Higher Education Evaluation System ("SINAES"), and will coordinate and execute on-site visits to Higher Education institutions in the process of accreditation/reaccreditation of institutions and undergraduate programs. 
 CONAESNational Commission on Higher Education Evaluation 
         CONAES is a committee under MEC supervision composed of 13 members, created to coordinate and monitor SINAES. To fulfill that duty, CONAES can establish guidelines to be followed by INEP in the development of evaluation tools, as well as submit the list of programs to be evaluated by the National Examination of Student Performance ("ENADE"). 
 SERESHigher Education Regulation and Supervision Secretariat 
         In 2011, SERESwhich operates as a MEC branchbecame the specific agency directly responsible for regulation and supervision of public and private HEIs, as well as undergraduate courses and lato sensu graduate programs, for both face-to-face and distance learning modalities. Its mission is to elevate the quality level of all higher education through the establishment of guidelines for the expansion of HEIs and their courses, in accordance with national curriculum guidelines and proprietary quality parameters. 
         SERES plans and coordinates the policy-making process for higher education and has been granted the power to (i) accredit HEIs and their undergraduate courses; (ii) oversee HEIs and courses, in order to fulfill the educational legislation and to induce improvements in quality standards; and (iii) design actions and update curriculum guidelines for undergraduate programs, as well as benchmarks for quality distance education, considering curricular guidelines and various forms of technology. SERES can also establish guidelines for the preparation of assessment instruments for higher education courses and ultimately manages the public system of registration and database of HEIs and higher education programs. Finally, SERES can apply the penalties provided for in regulation, following due process. 
         According to the LDB, higher education can be offered by public or private higher education institutions. A private institution of higher education shall be controlled, managed and maintained by an individual person(s) or legal entity, in either case referred to as the "mantenedora." The mantenedora is responsible for obtaining resources to meet the needs of the duly authorized HEI, which in regulatory terms is referred to as the "mantida." A mantenedora may be authorized to operate more than one mantida. In any case, the mantenedora is legally and financially responsible for all of its mantidas. Each of our HEIs in Brazil is maintained by a Laureate-controlled mantenedora. 
 22

           Regarding their organizational and academic prerogatives, institutions of undergraduate learning can be:
 

 Colleges (faculdades): Colleges are institutions of public or private education offering degree
programs in more than one area of knowledge and that are supported by a single supporting entity and have specific administration and management. Colleges may offer programs at the following levels:
traditional undergraduate programs, technological undergraduate programs, specialization and graduate programs (master's and Ph.D. degrees). Colleges do not have minimum requirements for the
qualifications of professors and their labor practices, and cannot establish new campuses or create programs and new locations without the prior permission of MEC. 
 University Centers (centro universitários): University centers are public or
private educational institutions that offer a variety of programs in higher education, including undergraduate programs, extension courses and lato
sensu graduate programsmaster's and Ph.D. degrees; they must also provide learning opportunities and career development for their professors. At least one third of
the faculty of a university center must be composed of persons with masters or doctorate degrees. In addition, at least one fifth of its professors must be composed of professors who work full time.
University centers have the autonomy to create, organize and extinguish individual courses and degree programs, as well as relocate or expand locations in their existing programs in the municipality
where the university center's headquarters is located, without prior permission of MEC. A university center cannot open campuses outside the municipality where its seat is located. 
 Universities (universidades): Universities are public or private institutions of higher
education that offer several degree programs, extension activities and development of institutional research. Like the university centers, at least one third of the faculty of a university must be
composed of persons with masters or doctorate degrees. In addition, at least one third of a university's faculty must be composed of professors who work full time. Similar to university centers,
universities have autonomy to create, organize and extinguish individual courses and degree programs, as well as to relocate or expand locations in their existing programs in the municipality where
the university's headquarters is located, without prior permission of MEC. Additionally, universities have the ability, upon prior authorization by MEC, to apply for accreditation of new campuses and
courses outside the municipality where the university's seat is located, provided that they are within the same state as the seat. 

         Among the HEIs in the Laureate International Universities network, there are three  faculdades (Faculdade Internacional da Paraíba, located in João Pessoa, PB; Faculdades Porto-Alegrense, located in Porto Alegre, RS; and Faculdade dos Guararapes de Recife, located in Recife, PE), six university centers (FADERGS Centro Universitário, located in Porto Alegre, RS; Centro Universitário dos Guararapes, located in Jaboatão dos Guararapes, PE; FMU Education Group, located in São Paulo, SP; Centro Universitário Ritter dos Reis, located in Porto Alegre, RS; Centro Universitário do Norte, located in Manaus, AM; and Instituto Brasileiro de Medicina de ReabilitaçãoIBMR, located in Rio de Janeiro, RJ), as well as three universities (Universidade Potiguar, located in Natal, RN; UNIFACSUniversidade Salvador, located in Salvador, BA; and Universidade Anhembi Morumbi, located in São Paulo, SP). In addition, Business School São Paulo, which is a professional degree-granting institution, is owned and operated by Universidade Anhembi Morumbi, and CEDEPE Business School, which is a professional degree-granting institution, is operated as a division of the Guararapes operation. As noted below, each form of HEI is entitled to a different level of autonomy within the regulatory framework. In turn, we factor the respective levels of autonomy into the operational strategy for each HEI, as the requirement of prior or post-facto MEC approval can delay or nullify specific new campus expansion projects, new course offerings, and increases in the number of authorized seats per course.

           Legislation provides for specific levels of didactic, scientific and administrative autonomy to universities, university centers and colleges in differing degrees with the aim of limiting outside influence by other institutions or persons outside of the HEI's internal governance structure. 
         The LDB provides that the following powers are guaranteed to universities and university centers in the exercise of their autonomy: (i) to create, organize and terminate undergraduate programs in their facilities, subject to applicable regulations; (ii) to establish the curriculum, subject to applicable general guidelines; (iii) to plan and execute scientific research, artistic production and extracurricular activities; (iv) to quantify the available seats for each program, except in specific undergraduate programs where the total number of available seats in the entire system is controlled by MEC in conjunction with the input of the relevant professional associations; (v) to prepare and amend their bylaws in accordance with the general applicable standards; and (vi) to grant degrees, diplomas and other qualifications. 
         Although colleges have administrative autonomy, they do not enjoy academic autonomy and, therefore, are subject to MEC's prior authorization to create new programs and degree programs. 
         Distance education.    Distance Education, or Educação a Distância ("EaD"), in Brazil is primarily regulated by the LDB. The law defines EaD as an educational modality in which the didactic and pedagogical measurement in teaching and learning processes occur with the use of media, information and communication technologies, with students and teachers developing educational activities at a different place and/or time. 
         EaD programs can be offered at different levels and types of higher education, covering continuing education programs, undergraduate, specialization, master's and Ph.D., as well as professional education (including technical, medium and technological level of higher education). Universities and university centers accredited to offer EaD programs may create, organize and terminate programs, upon notice to MEC. Colleges ('faculdades') must seek prior MEC authorization. 
         The new regulatory framework for distance education (Decree # 9.057/2017) significantly reduced the regulatory and operational hindrances to the expansion of undergraduate and postgraduate, allowing a specific accreditation to offer EaD programs exclusively, without the need of a prior face-to-face HEI accreditation, making it possible to create a HEI dedicated to EaD programs, with lower operational costs and reduced regulatory complexity. Further, another characteristic of EaD programs in Brazilthe mandatory presence of brick-and-mortar support facilities, or 'polos', for in-person activities such as professional practice labs and examshas been relaxed, thus making full online programs possible. 
         Under the new regulation, the need for classroom activities to be developed at the polos will be determined by the pedagogical projects of the respective programs, according to an HEI's own discretion. However, curriculum guidelines published by the National Board of Education may require activities to be developed in laboratory or professional settings, which may compromise some of this prerogative. 
         The decree also eliminated the need for prior polo accreditation, which becomes another prerogative of the accredited HEIs. However, a maximum number of new polos to be created annually by HEIs was stipulated, based on their institutional evaluation, or CI score (resulting from official onsite evaluations). HEIs with a CI score equal to 3 can create up to 50 new polos per year, whereas those with CI score of 4 can create 150 new  polos. HEIs with a maximum CI score equal to 5 can create up to 250 new polos per year. 
         HEIs offering EaD programs, including their polos, are subject to inspection by the MEC at any time, as to determine compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. EaD certificates or diplomas issued by accredited HEIs have national validity, with the same force and effect as those issued for face-to-face programs. 
 24

    Accreditation.    The first accreditation of an institution of higher education is necessarily as a college. The accreditation as a university or university center is only granted after the institution has operated as a college for at least six years and has demonstrated that it has met satisfactory quality standards, including positive evaluation by the SINAES, as well as met legal requirements applicable to each type of institution of undergraduate learning, including minimum degree attainment and terms of faculty employment. 
         Following accreditation, colleges must obtain MEC permission to offer new undergraduate degree programs. As consequence of their autonomy, universities and university centers do not require MEC authorization to create programs in the city where the university's or university center's headquarters are located. They need only inform MEC about the programs they offer for registration, evaluation and subsequent recognition. However, the creation of graduate programs in law, medicine, dentistry, nursing and psychology, whether by colleges, universities or university centers, are subject to the opinion of the proper professional associations. 
         Once a non-autonomous institution gets authorization to offer a particular program, it has to seek accreditation in the period between 50% and 75% of the program's completion. Institutional and programmatic accreditation has to be renewed periodically in accordance with the regularly applicable MEC evaluation process. 
         Decree n. 9.235, published in December 2017, condensed various directives present in several normative instruments, aiming setting procedural standards and decision models for accreditation. The new regulation eliminated the need for a previous mandatory decision of the MEC, which effectively granted wider autonomy to HEIs. Such autonomy, however, is tied to a performance score beyond the merely satisfactory grade in the official evaluation integrated with the accreditation process. 
         This increased autonomy primarily benefits university-like structures (i.e., universidades and centros universitarios).  Universidades are now allowed to have the same autonomy prerogatives at their satellite campuses that they already enjoy at their headquarters, such as program creation, seat openings, etc. They must, however, sustain above average performance scores, and the same minimum proportion of faculty (one-third) working full time and/or with a master's/Ph.D. at each campus receiving autonomy.  Centros universitarios, once geographically limited to the headquarters municipality, are now allowed to expand statewide, although there will be no autonomy prerogatives for such units; their new programs and seat expansion initiatives will have to be authorized by the MEC. 
  Evaluation.    SINAES was established to evaluate HEI as institutions of higher education, traditional degree and technology degree programs and student academic performance, so as to improve the quality of higher education in Brazil. In practice, the CONAES conducts the monitoring and coordination efforts of SINAES. The results of the institutional and course evaluations are represented on a scale of five levels, and when facing unsatisfactory results, the HEI will be required to enter into an agreement with MEC to establish a remediation initiative. Failure to comply, in whole or in part, with the conditions provided in the term of commitment may result in one or more penalties imposed by MEC, including temporary suspension of the opening of the selective process for undergraduate programs and cancellation of accreditation or reaccreditation of the institution and the authorization for operation of its programs. 
         External evaluations of institutions of higher education are carried out by INEP in two instances, first, when an institution applies for its first accreditation and second, by the end of each of SINAES's evaluation; primarily based on the following criteria: (i) institutional development plan; (ii) social and institutional responsibility; (iii) infrastructure and financial condition; and (iv) pedagogical monitoring of student academic performance. 
 25

          
        The evaluation of graduate programs is made by the Coordination of Superior Level Staff Improvement ("CAPES"), which is responsible for establishing the quality standard required of masters and doctoral programs, along with the identification and evaluation of the courses that meet this standard. 
         The evaluation of student academic performance is conducted by INEP, which requires each student to sit for the ENADE in order to verify the knowledge and technical skill of the student body. Each ENADE test is developed in accordance with the content and specific curriculum of each educational program. Students enrolled in undergraduate programs take the ENADE every three years. In this system, students are evaluated at the end of the last year of each program. 
  Transfer of control.    Although changes of control exercised by Laureate do not ordinarily need MEC prior approval or review, due to the level of Laureate's consolidated gross revenues throughout Brazil, current Brazilian law requires that every control transaction, with limited exceptions, that Laureate enters into must be submitted to the Brazilian anti-trust authority, the Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Economico (the "CADE"), for approval. Such request for approval must be granted prior to the definitive closing of such transaction. CADE has the power to reject and/or alter any transaction or any part of a transaction that it deems to unduly restrict competition. 
  Incentive programs.    Programa Universidade Para Todos ("PROUNI") is a federal program of tax benefits designed to increase higher education participation rates by making college more affordable. PROUNI provides private HEIs with an exemption from certain federal taxes in exchange for granting partial and full scholarships to low-income students enrolled in traditional and technology undergraduate programs. All of our HEIs adhere to PROUNI. 
         HEIs may join PROUNI by signing a term of membership valid for ten years and renewable for the same period. This term of membership shall include the number of scholarships to be offered in each program, unit and class, and a percentage of scholarships for degree programs to be given to indigenous and Afro-Brazilians. To join PROUNI, an educational institution must maintain a certain relationship between the number of scholarships granted and the number of regular paying students. The relationship between the number of scholarships and regular paying students is tested annually. If this relationship is not observed during a given academic year due to the departure of students, the institution must adjust the number of scholarships in a proportional manner the following academic year. 
         An HEI that has joined PROUNI and remains in good standing is exempted, in whole or in part, from the following taxes during the period in which the term of membership is in effect:
 

 IRPJ (income tax) and CSLL (social contribution), with respect to the portion of net income in proportion to revenues from traditional and
technology undergraduate programs; and 
 Cofins (Contribution for the Financing of Social Security) and PIS (Program of Social Integration), concerning revenues from traditional and
technology undergraduate programs. 

         A number of municipal and state governments have sought to replicate PROUNI by creating their own programs that, for example, offer tax incentives through a reduction in, or credits against, the ISS (Municipal Services Tax) in exchange for scholarships to targeted social groups or professions. Laureate owns and operates HEIs in several jurisdictions where such local incentive programs are in force. 
         Student financing program.    Fundo de Financiamento Estudantil ("FIES") is a federal program established to provide financing to students enrolled in courses in private institutions of higher education that have maintained a minimum satisfactory evaluation according to SINAES and receive a grade of 3 or higher out of 5 on the ENADE. The primary factor in determining whether a student is eligible to receive full or partial financing is how he or she scores on the program's means testing of household income relative to the cost of tuition. 
 26

           Under this basic structure, FIES targets both of the government's education policy goals: increased access and improved academic quality outcomes. The HEI receives the benefit of the FIES program through its participation in the intermediation of CFT-E (Certificado Financeiro do Tesouro) bonds, which are public bonds issued to the HEI by the federal government that the HEI may use to pay the national social security tax imposed by the INSS (National Social Security Institute) and certain other federal tax obligations. If the HEI is current with its taxes (i.e., it possesses a tax clearance certificate and is not otherwise involved in any tax-related disputes with the federal government that are not being defended in compliance with applicable security/bond requirements), then the HEI also has the option to sell the bonds for cash in a public auction conducted by one of the government-sponsored banks. 
         Following changes initiated in 2014, a new FIES reform was implemented by the Provisional Presidential Decree (Medida Provisória) n. 785/2017, which amended the FIES legal statute (Law n. 10.260/2001). The current FIES offer conditions were consolidated for the selection rules for the 2018.1 semester. 
         The traditional FIES financing program continues to be offered to about one third of vacancies announced for the program in 2018. For the traditional offering, the candidate should have family income of up to three times the minimum wage, and while the previous 18-month grace period was eliminated, financing will have a zero interest rate. The risk is borne by a new guarantee fundcalled FG-FIESwhich may have initial public contributions of up to R$ 3 billion, and contributions from HEIs ranging from 13% for the first year, between 10% and 25% for the second to fifth year (according to delinquency-related variances), and at least 10% from the sixth year on. 
         The second financing offercalled P-FIEShas two variables, according to the funding sources (a. Constitutional/Regional Development Funds or b. the BNDES). The distribution of vacancies for this modality favors programs offered in corresponding regional limits. This FIES offer will be operated strictly by financial agents, who will also bear the risks of the operation. 
         As of December 31, 2018, approximately 11% of our students in Brazil participated in FIES, representing approximately 20% of our Brazil 2018 net revenues. 
   Chilean Regulation
        The Political Constitution of the Republic of Chile guarantees every individual's right to education and sets forth the state's obligation to promote the development of education at all levels. It also provides for liberty in teaching, which includes the right to open, organize and maintain educational institutions, providing that a Constitutional Organic Law, which requires a super-majority vote in the Chilean Congress, must establish the requirements for the official recognition of educational institutions. 
         The General Law on Education sets forth the requirements and the procedure for the official recognition of educational institutions, providing for an educational system that is mixed in nature, including a form of education owned and managed by the state and its bodies and another one that is privately provided. The principles that inspire the Chilean educational system include those of universality, by virtue of which education should be affordable to all individuals, quality of education, and respect for and promotion of the autonomy of the educational institutions, within the framework of the laws governing them. 
         In the case of higher education, the law provides a licensing system for new institutions that, once completed, makes it possible for these institutions to achieve full autonomy. This autonomy consists of every higher education institution's right to govern itself, as provided in its bylaws, in all matters regarding the fulfillment of its purpose, and encompasses academic, economic and administrative autonomy. Academic autonomy includes the higher education entities' power to decide by themselves the manner in which their teaching, research and extension functions will be fulfilled and the 
 27

   establishment of their curricula and programs. Economic autonomy makes it possible for those establishments to manage their resources to fulfill their goals pursuant to their bylaws and the laws, while administrative autonomy empowers each higher education establishment to organize its operation in the form deemed most appropriate in accordance with its bylaws and the relevant laws. 
         The Ministry of Education ("MINEDUC") is the department of state in charge of promoting the development of education at all levels. Its functions include those of proposing and assessing the policies and plans for educational and cultural development, assigning the necessary resources for the conduct of educational and cultural extension activities, evaluating the development of education, discussing and proposing general norms applicable to the sector and overseeing their enforcement, granting official recognition to educational institutions, supervising the activities of its dependent units and fulfilling the other functions assigned by the law. 
         The MINEDUC's Higher Education Division is the unit in charge of overseeing compliance with the legal and regulatory norms that govern higher education, of providing advice on the proposal of policies at this level of education and of establishing institutional relations with the officially recognized higher education institutions. 
         The New Higher Education Law (the "New Law"), enacted on May 29, 2018, introduced major changes in the higher education sector. It created the Superintendency of Higher Education, whose purpose is to supervise and oversee compliance with the legal and regulatory provisions that regulate the higher education institutions in its field of competence as well as to supervise the allocation of resources by higher education institutions to ensure their allocation to appropriate purposes in accordance with the law and each institution's bylaws. The Superintendency of Higher Education is empowered to enter the premises of the universities it supervises when necessary, in order to request documents for inspection processes, and carry out on-site audits. In the case of related parties, the Superintendency may request any information it deems appropriate for its audit processes, may supervise "by the means it deems appropriate" all operations, assets, files, etc. of the individuals or institutions supervised, as well as of the related third entities, and will be able to summon for deposition any person related to the institution who has had transactions with the institution. The Superintendency is empowered to issue regulations to effectuate its responsibilities under the New Law. See "Recent Developments." 
         The Undersecretary of Higher Education, which will replace the MINEDUC's Higher Education Division, will serve as a direct collaborator with the Minister of Education in the preparation, coordination, execution and evaluation of policies and programs for higher education, especially in matters relating to its development, promotion, internationalization and ongoing improvement, both in the university and in the technical-professional subsystems. 
         The National Education Council (Consejo Nacional de Educación) is an autonomous entity composed of ten members who must be academicians, professors or professionals with an outstanding career in teaching and educational management and whose functions, regarding higher education, consist of:
 

 managing the license-granting system for new institutions; 
 deciding on institutional projects submitted by institutions for the purpose of their official recognition; 
 verifying the development of institutional projects of the institutions that have been approved; 
 establishing selective examination systems for the subjects or courses of study delivered by the higher education institutions subject to
license-granting processes in order to evaluate compliance with the curricula and programs and the performance of students; 

 28

   

 requesting from the MINEDUC, on a supported basis, the revocation of official recognition of the universities, professional institutes and
technical training centers under the license-granting process; 
 managing the revocation process of higher education institutions; 
 assisting the MINEDUC in the management of the shutdown processes of autonomous higher education institutions, especially as to the process of
awarding diplomas and degrees to students who are in the course of their education at the time of shutdown; and 
 serving as an appeals body for decisions of the National Accreditation Commission. 

         The National Accreditation Commission (Comisión Nacional de Acreditación) is an autonomous entity, the function of which is to verify and promote the quality of the autonomous universities, professional institutes and technical training centers and of the courses of study and programs offered by them. In particular, the National Accreditation Commission is required to deliver an opinion on the institutional accreditation of higher education institutions, authorize the private agencies in charge of accreditation of courses of study and undergraduate programs and bachelor programs and specialty programs in the area of health, and supervise their operation. 
         The Managing Commission of the Credit System for Higher Education Studies (Comisión Administradora del Sistema de Créditos para Estudios Superiores) is an entity whose functions include defining and assessing policies for the development and implementation of financing arrangements for higher education studies, entering into and proposing modifications to any necessary agreements with both domestic and foreign public and private financing entities and implementing those arrangements, and defining and evaluating the policies for higher education loans guaranteed by the state. 
         Organization and recognition of higher education institutions.    The law recognizes state-owned higher education institutions, which may only be created by a law, and private institutions that must be organized in accordance with provisions contained in the law. The Chilean legislation provides that the state will officially recognize the following higher education institutions: 
 

 Universities:  Universities may grant professional certificates and all
kinds of academic degrees, including graduate certificates, bachelor's degrees and Ph.Ds. Universities are the only institutions entitled to grant professional certificates with respect to which the
law requires having previously obtained a bachelor's degree. 
 Professional Institutes:  Professional institutes may only confer
professional certificates of the type that do not require a bachelor's degree, and technical certificates of a superior level to those students who have completed programs of at least 1,600 class
hours without receiving a bachelor's degree. 
 Technical Training Centers:  Technical training centers may only confer a
technical certificate of a superior level to those students who have completed programs of at least 1,600 class hours. 
 Educational institutions of the armed forces and police. 

         Private universities must be created in accordance with the procedures set forth by law, and must always be not-for-profit entities in order to be officially recognized. 
         Private professional institutes and technical training centers may be created by any individual or legal entity, they may be organized as for-profit or not-for-profit entities, and their sole purpose must be the creation, organization and maintenance of a professional institute or technical training center. 
         In order to be officially recognized, universities, professional institutes and technical training centers must have the necessary teaching, didactic, economic, financial and physical resources to offer the academic degrees, professional certificates or technical certificates, as appropriate, which must be 
 29

   certified by the National Education Council. Additionally, these institutions must have a certification granted by the National Education Council evidencing that the entity has had both its institutional project and its academic programs approved and that it will have the progressive verification of its institutional development performed. Higher education institutions may only start their teaching activities once the official recognition has been granted. In Chile, the Laureate International Universities network comprises three universities and two professional institutes. 
         The official recognition of a higher education institution may be revoked and, in the case of universities, their legal existence may be revoked through a supported Statutory Decree of the MINEDUC, after a decision of the National Education Council adopted by the majority of its members in a meeting called for that sole purpose and after hearing the affected party, if that party (i) fails to comply with the objectives set forth in its bylaws, (ii) conducts activities contrary to morals, public order, good customs or national security, (iii) commits gross violations of its bylaws, or (iv) ceases to confer professional certificates to its graduates. 
         The law provides for a system of license grants to higher education institutions, which includes the approval of institutional project and the evaluation, progress and materialization of its educational project for a period of no less than six years, at the end of which they may become fully autonomous. 
  National system of quality assurance in higher education.    The law provides for a system of quality assurance in higher education that includes a system of institutional accreditation that consists of a process of analysis of existing mechanisms within the autonomous higher education institutions to guarantee their quality, bearing in mind both the existence of those mechanisms and their application and results, and a process of accreditation of courses of study or programs, consisting of a process of verification of the quality of the courses of study or programs offered by the autonomous higher education institutions, on the basis of their declared purposes and the criteria set forth by the respective academic and professional communities. 
         Both the institutional accreditation and the accreditation of courses of study and undergraduate programs are voluntary, except that the courses of study and academic programs leading to the professional degrees of Surgeon, Elementary Education Teacher, Secondary Education Teacher, Differential Education Teacher and Nursery School Teacher are subject to mandatory accreditation. 
         The institutional accreditation is filed with the National Accreditation Commission, whereas the accreditation of courses of study and undergraduate programs can be performed by domestic, foreign or international accreditation entities authorized by the National Accreditation Commission. 
  Tax benefits.    Chilean universities recognized by the state, and the associations, corporations, partnerships and foundations that are created, organized or maintained by those universities, are exempted from paying tax on the income arising exclusively from their educational activities. Likewise, educational institutions are exempted from paying value-added tax, an exemption that is limited to the revenues arising from their teaching activities. Additionally, universities are exempted from paying withholding taxes for payments made abroad. There are also specific tax benefits for donations made to universities. 
  Financing.    The Chilean state contributes to the direct financing of universities existing as of December 31, 1980 by means of contributions from the state. In addition, all universities, professional institutes and technical training centers recognized as higher education institutions receive an indirect contribution from the state, which is distributed on the basis of the scores obtained in the university admission test by the students enrolled in each higher education institution. 
         Under the Crédito con Aval del Estado (the "CAE Program"), the state guarantees up to 90% of the principal plus interest on loans granted by financial institutions to students of higher education at autonomous, accredited institutions officially recognized by the state that select their first-year students 
 30

   on the basis of the score obtained in the university admission test and that use the aforesaid indirect contribution by the state exclusively for institutional development purposes. 
         The Nuevo Milenio Scholarship ("NMS") program supports access to vocational and technical education for students in the lowest 70% who met or exceeded certain academic standards by providing annual scholarships (i) under NMS I in amounts up to CLP 600,000; (ii) under NMS II in amounts up to CLP 850,000 per year for students who come from the first five income deciles if the tech/voc institution in which they are enrolled is organized as a not-for-profit legal entity or, if the tech/voc institution is not so organized, the institution has stated in writing its intention to become a not-for-profit entity and to be accredited; and (iii) under NMS III in amounts up to CLP 900,000 per year, provided that such students and the institution in which they enroll meet the requirements for NMS II and the tech/voc institution was, on December 31, 2015, accredited for four years or more. 
  Provisional administrator.    In December 2014, the Chilean Congress adopted the Provisional Administrator Law (the "Provisional Administrator Law"), which provides for the appointment of a provisional administrator or closing administrator to handle the affairs of failing universities or universities found to have breached their bylaws. 
         Recent developments.    On May 29, 2018 the New Law was enacted. Among other things, the New Law created the Undersecretary of Higher Education and the Superintendency of Higher Education, provided that for profit entities may control not-for-profit institutions, but prohibited conflicts of interests and related party transactions with notable exceptions, including the provision of services that are educational in nature or essential for the university's purposes, and introduced changes to the national system of quality assurance in higher education. The New Law provides for a transition period between one and two years. 
         The Company is currently reviewing the impact the New Law could have on its Chilean operations, including the extent to which the New Law will affect existing contractual relationships that the Company maintains with its Chilean non-profit universities. The Superintendent is required to issue regulations by May 29, 2019. Once the Superintendent issues the regulations, the Company and the Chilean universities may need to evaluate additional modifications to the existing contractual relationships. 
         On February 18, 2014, the MINEDUC disclosed that on November 15, 2013 and February 11, 2014, it had initiated internal investigations into UDLA Chile and UNAB, respectively. The investigations were initiated upon referrals from the National Education Council and the National Accreditation Commission, which had conveyed to the MINEDUC their concerns regarding certain agreements entered into by UDLA Chile and UNAB with their controlling entities, including concerns about the amount and real use made by the universities of the services provided under those agreements. The investigations were intended by the MINEDUC to determine whether it should begin formal sanction proceedings against the universities. The MINEDUC also disclosed that it had delivered relevant documentation on the matter to the Public Prosecutor. In January 2016, the MINEDUC announced that it had closed the investigation into UNAB. 
         In June 2016, the MINEDUC notified UNAB that it was opening an investigation into possible violations of the not-for-profit nature of UNAB. In September 2016, the MINEDUC notified UVM Chile that it was opening a similar investigation of UVM Chile. 
 31

          
        On October 11, 2018, the MINEDUC announced that it had closed the investigations into UNAB, UDLA and UVM. In its final resolution the MINEDUC found no specific, sanctionable conduct on the part of any of the not-for-profit universities while reaffirming the obligation to ensure that their conduct comply with the New Law when implemented. 
         In December 2016, Servicios de Impuestos Internos Chile ("SII") notified separately UDLA Chile and UNAB that as part of the general audit program called "Auditoría Integral a Universidades," it was requesting supporting documentation from them for the tax periods between November 2013 and October 2016. On March 21, 2017, SII sent a similar notification to UVM Chile regarding the tax periods from May 2014 to October 2016. Each institution has submitted responsive documents that support taxes paid related to its revenues and expenses, including to the extent such revenues and expenses involve financial arrangements with Laureate for-profit entities. On November 29, 2017, the SII notified UVM Chile that its audit detected "no differences" between the taxes paid and the taxes owed and provided UVM Chile with a written closure letter. In June 19, 2018, the SII notified UNAB and in June 29, 2018 the SII notified UDLA, that its audits detected "no differences" between the taxes paid and the taxes owed and provided UNAB and UDLA with a written closure letter. 
   Mexican Regulation
        Mexican law provides that private entities are entitled to render education services in accordance with applicable legal provisions. These provisions regulate the education services rendered by the federal government, the states and private entities and contain guidelines for the allocation of the higher education role among the federal government, the states and the municipalities, including their respective economic contributions, in order to jointly participate in the development and coordination of higher education. 
         There are three levels of regulation in Mexico: federal, state and municipal. The federal authority is the Federal Ministry of Public Education (Secretaría de Educación Pública). Each of the 31 states and Mexico City has the right to establish a local Ministry of Education, and each municipality of each state may establish a municipal education authority that only has authority to advertise and promote educational services and/or activities. 
         Some functions are exclusive to the Federal Ministry of Education, such as the establishment of study plans and programs for Basic and Mid-Superior education services. There are also concurrent functions, such as the granting and withdrawal of governmental recognition of validity of studies (Reconocimiento de Validez Oficial de Estudios) ("REVOEs," for its acronym in Spanish). 
         The General Law on Education (Ley General de Educación) in Mexico classifies studies in the following three categories: (i) Basic Education, which includes pre-school (kindergarten), elementary school and junior high school (secundaria); (ii) Mid-Superior Education, which includes high school (preparatoria) and equivalent studies, as well as professional education that does not consider  preparatoria as a prerequisite; and (iii) Superior Education, which includes the studies taught after  preparatoria, including undergraduate school (licenciatura), specialties (especialidades), masters studies, doctorate studies and studies for teachers (educación normal). 
         The REVOEs are issued either by the Federal Ministry of Education under the General Law on Education or by any of the state Ministries of Education under the applicable state law. REVOEs are granted for each program taught at each campus. If there is a change in the program or in the campus at which it is taught, the entity will need to get a new REVOE. 
         The Federal Ministry of Education has issued a set of general resolutions (Acuerdos) that regulate the general requirements for obtaining REVOEs. The main Acuerdos are (i) Acuerdo 243, issued on May 27, 1998, which sets the general guidelines for obtaining an Authorization or REVOE; (ii) Acuerdo 17/11/17, issued on November 10, 2017, which sets the procedures related to REVOEs for 
 32

   Superior Education studies; and (iii) Acuerdo 18/11/18, issued on November 27, 2018, which defines the different levels, models and educational options at Superior Education. The Federal Ministry of Education recommends to the local Ministries of Education the adoption and inclusion of the provisions contained in  Acuerdo 243 and Acuerdo 17/11/17 in the local Law on Education and other applicable local laws and regulations. 
         Depending on each state, other requirements may apply, for example, that private institutions that provide educational services with REVOEs need to be registered with the corresponding local authorities. 
         Acuerdo 17/11/17 regulates in detail the provisions contained under the General Law on Education to grant REVOEs for Superior Education studies, regarding faculty, plans and programs of studies, inspection visits, procedures, etc. Acuerdo 17/11/17 also provides that private institutions that provide Superior Education services in accordance with presidential decrees or secretarial resolutions (acuerdos secretariales) issued specifically to them may maintain the obligations provided to them thereunder and may function under the simplified provisions of Acuerdo 17/11/17. Currently, Universidad Tecnológica de México, S.C. and Universidad del Valle de México, S.C. have secretarial resolutions that were issued in their favor before the issuance of Acuerdo 17/11/17. The obligations contained in these secretarial resolutions generally conform to the obligations provided under  Acuerdo 17/11/17. 
         The regulatory authorities are entitled to conduct inspection visits to the facilities of educational institutions to verify compliance with applicable legal provisions. Failure to comply with applicable legal provisions may result in the imposition of fines, the cancellation of the applicable REVOE and the closure of the education facilities. 
         Private institutions with REVOEs are required to grant a minimum percentage of scholarships to students. Acuerdo 17/11/17 requires private institutions to grant scholarships to at least five percent of the total students registered during each academic term. Scholarships consist, in whole or in part, of payment of the registration and tuition fees established by the educational institution. 
         Private entities may also obtain the recognition of validity of their programs from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México or "UNAM"). The General Regulations of Incorporation and Validation of Studies issued by UNAM provide that programs followed in private entities may be "incorporated" to UNAM in order for UNAM to recognize their validity. 
         The UNAM regulations also require private entities incorporated to UNAM to grant scholarships to at least five percent of the total students registered at such entity. The students entitled to have this benefit will be selected by UNAM. Some of our high school programs and one of our medical programs are incorporated to UNAM. 
   Peruvian Regulation
        We operate three post-secondary education institutions in Peru, two of which are universities and one of which is a technical-vocational institute. Peruvian law provides that universities and technical-vocational institutes can be operated as public or private entities, and that the private entities may be organized for profit. The Ministry of Education has overall responsibility for the national education system. 
         In 2014, the Peruvian Congress enacted a new University Law to regulate the establishment, operation, monitoring and closure of universities. The law also promotes continuous improvement of quality at Peruvian universities. The law created a new agency, the Superintendencia de Educación Superior Universitaria ("SUNEDU"), which is responsible for carrying out the governmental role in university regulation, including ensuring quality. While institutional autonomy is still recognized, and universities are permitted to create their own internal governance rules and determine their own 
 33

   academic, management and economic systems, including curriculum design and entrance and graduation requirements, all of these matters are now subject to review and evaluation by SUNEDU through its periodic review of universities as part of a license renewal process. 
         Under the new law, university licenses are temporary but renewable, and are granted by SUNEDU for a maximum of eight years. On November 24, 2015 the Board of SUNEDU promulgated regulations for the university licensing process. For licenses to be renewed, universities have to demonstrate to SUNEDU that they comply with, at a minimum, certain Basic Quality Conditions ("BQCs") (i.e., that they have specified academic goals and that the degrees granted and plans of study are aligned with those goals, that their academic offerings are compatible with their planning goals, (e.g., there is sufficient labor demand for careers offered) that there are only two regular semesters of studies per year, that they have appropriate infrastructure and equipment, that they engage in research, that they have a sufficient supply of qualified teachers, at least 25% of whom will need to be full-time, that they supply adequate basic complementary educational services (e.g., medical and psychological services and sports activities), that they provide appropriate placement office services, and that they have transparency of institutional information). Both UPC and UPN had their licenses renewed in 2017, in each case for a period of six years. 
         Technical-vocational institutes are regulated by the Ministry of Education, which grants operating licenses for not less than three nor more than six years, after which the Ministry conducts a revalidation process. The approval of new institute licenses is based on the evaluation by the Ministry of the institute's institutional goals, the curricula of its education programs and their link with careers needed in the Peruvian economy, the availability of adequate qualified teachers, the institute's infrastructure, the institute's financial resources, and the favorable opinion of the National System of Assessment, Accreditation and Certification of Education Quality ("SINEACES") regarding the appropriateness of the programs the institute is offering. SINEACES is also responsible for the accreditation of programs and careers at all higher education institutions. On November 2, 2016 a new law regarding technical-vocational institutes (the "Institutes Law") was enacted. Under the Institutes Law, technical-vocational institutes are regulated by the Ministry of Education, which grants operating licenses. The Institutes Law has created two types of institutes, Higher Education Institutes ("Institutes") and Higher Education Colleges ("Colleges"). Institutes are dedicated to technical careers and Colleges are devoted to technical careers related to education as well as science and information Technology. Colleges grant Technical Bachelor Degrees and Professional Technical Degrees. Institutes and Colleges are subject to a mandatory license granted by the Ministry of Education, based on an evaluation to determine compliance with BQCs. BQCs include: an appropriate institutional management guaranteeing a proper relation with the educational model of the institution; appropriate academic management and proper program studies aligned with the Ministry of Education norms; appropriate infrastructure and equipment to develop educational activities; adequate teachers and staff which, at a minimum, should consist of 20% full-time staff; and appropriate financial and economic provisions. The Law provides that the process will last no more than 90 days and will grant a license for a five-year period to be renewed once expired. Unlike licenses, quality accreditation is voluntary except for certain careers for which it might be mandatory as determined by law. Such accreditation will be taken into consideration for access to public grants for scholarships and research among other things. Private Institutes and Colleges may be organized as for-profit or not-for-profit entities under Peruvian law. Not-for-profit Colleges' and Institutes' income is exempt from taxes on their educational activities. For-profit Colleges and Institutes are subject to income taxes, but may qualify for a tax credit on 30% of their reinvested income, subject to a reinvestment program to be filed with the Ministry of Education for a maximum term of five years. The specific requirements of such programs were determined by regulations in August 2017. According to the schedule determined by the regulations, in May 2018 Cibertec was granted a license by the Ministry of Education for a five-year period. 
 34

           In November 2018, Laureate Education Peru SRL, acquired Instituto de Educación Superior Tecnológico Privado Red Avansys S.A.C. ("Avansys"). Avansys is an Institute that offers 25 careers to close to 3,000 students in a single campus located in downtown Lima in an educational cluster for Institutes. Avansys obtained its license from the Ministry of Education in April 2018, for a five-year period. Cibertec and Avansys merged from a corporate and tax perspective as of February 1, 2019. Following the recording of the merger in the Public Registry, the merged entity ("Cibertec-Avansys") will ask for a new educational license which, according to law, should be granted not later than 90 days after the petition is filed. 
   U.S. Regulation
        Our institutions in the United States are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Department of Education (the "DOE"), accrediting agencies and state educational agencies. The regulations, standards and policies of these agencies cover substantially all of the operations of our higher education institutions in the United States ("U.S. Institutions"), including their educational programs, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, finances, results of operations and financial condition. 
         As institutions of higher education that grant degrees and diplomas, our U.S. Institutions are required to be authorized by appropriate state educational agencies. In addition, the DOE regulates our U.S. Institutions due to their participation in federal student financial aid programs under Title IV of the U.S. Higher Education Act (the "HEA"), or Title IV programs. Title IV programs currently include grants and educational loans provided directly by the federal government, including loans to students and parents through the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (the "Direct Loan Program"). The Direct Loan Program offers Federal Stafford Loans, Federal Parent PLUS Loans, Federal Grad PLUS Loans and Federal Consolidation Loans. Prior to July 1, 2010, Title IV programs also included educational loans issued by private banks with below-market interest rates that are guaranteed by the federal government in the event of a student's default on repaying the loan. A significant percentage of students at our U.S. Institutions rely on the availability of Title IV programs to finance their cost of attendance. 
         In addition to complying with specific requirements contained in the HEA and regulations issued thereunder by the DOE, in order to participate in Title IV programs, our U.S. Institutions also are required to maintain authorization by the appropriate state educational agency or agencies and be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the DOE. 
         We plan and implement our business activities to comply with the standards of these regulatory agencies. To monitor compliance with this regulatory environment, institutions participating in Title IV programs undergo periodic reviews to demonstrate, among other things, that they maintain proper accreditation, state authorization, and adequate financial resources. Historically, our U.S. Institutions have maintained eligibility to access Title IV funding. 
   State Education Authorization and Regulation 
         Our U.S. Institutions are required by the HEA to be authorized by applicable state educational agencies in the states where we are located to participate in Title IV programs. To maintain requisite state authorizations, our U.S. Institutions are required to continuously meet standards relating to, among other things, educational programs, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, marketing and recruitment, financial operations, addition of new locations and educational programs and various operational and administrative procedures. These standards can be different from and conflict with the requirements of the DOE and other applicable regulatory bodies. State laws and regulations are subject to change and may limit our ability to offer educational programs and offer certain degrees. Some states may also prescribe financial regulations that are different from those of the DOE and may 
 35

   require the posting of surety bonds. Failure to comply with the requirements of applicable state educational agencies could result in us losing our authorization to offer educational programs in those states. If that were to occur, the applicable state educational agency could force us to cease enrolling students in their state. Alternatively, the state educational licensing agencies could restrict the institution's ability to offer certain degree or diploma programs. The loss of an authorization by the state in which the institution is based could also impact the ability of such institution to participate in Title IV programs. 
         Each of our U.S. Institutions maintains an authorization from the pertinent state regulatory authority in which such institutions are physically located, or is exempt under current state law from a requirement to be specifically authorized. If any of the authorizations provided to one or more of our U.S. Institutions are determined not to comply with the DOE regulations, or one or more of our U.S. Institutions is unable to obtain or maintain an authorization that satisfies the DOE requirements, students at the pertinent institution may be unable to access Title IV funds, which could force the institution to cease operations in the state. 
         Additionally, the DOE is currently reviewing its state authorization requirements pertaining to distance education. On December 19, 2016, the DOE published final regulations regarding state authorization for programs offered through distance education and state authorization for foreign locations of institutions. Among other provisions, these final regulations require that an institution participating in the Title IV federal student aid programs and offering post-secondary education through distance education be authorized by each state in which the institution enrolls students, if such authorization is required by the state, as well as required each institution to document and make certain disclosures regarding the state process for resolving complaints for programs offered through distance education or correspondence. The DOE would recognize, although not specifically require, authorization through participation in a state authorization reciprocity agreement, if the agreement does not prevent a state from enforcing its own laws. These regulations were meant to take effect on July 1, 2018, but the DOE announced a delay and has since begun a new rulemaking process in January of 2019 that includes a review of these regulations. We cannot predict with certainty when these new regulations would be finalized or effective. 
         Several states have asserted jurisdiction over educational institutions offering online degree programs that have no physical location or other presence in the state, but that have some activity in the state, such as enrolling or offering educational services to students who reside in the state, conducting practica or sponsoring internships in the state, employing faculty who reside in the state or advertising to or recruiting prospective students in the state. Thus, our activities in certain states constitute a presence requiring licensure or authorization under requirements of state law, regulation or policy of the state educational agency, even though we do not have a physical facility in such states. Therefore, in addition to the states where we maintain physical facilities, we have obtained, or are in the process of obtaining, approvals or exemptions that we believe are necessary in connection with our activities that may constitute a presence in such states requiring licensure or authorization by the state educational agency based on the laws, rules or regulations of that state. Some of our approvals are pending or are in the renewal process. Some of our U.S. Institutions do not have current approvals or exemptions from all of the state educational agencies that may require such an approval or exemption due to the U.S. Institution enrolling students via distance education in the state. 
         Notwithstanding our efforts to obtain approvals or exemptions, state regulatory requirements for online education vary among the states, are not well developed in many states, are imprecise or unclear in some states and can change frequently. Because our U.S. Institutions enroll students in online degree programs, we expect that regulatory authorities in other states where we are not currently licensed or authorized may request that we seek additional licenses or authorizations for these institutions in their states in the future. In recent years, regional state compacts have created the National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements ("NC-SARA"), which is a voluntary 
 36

   agreement among member states and U.S. territories that establishes comparable national standards for interstate offering of postsecondary distance-education courses and programs. As of the date of this filing, all states except California participate in NC-SARA. NC-SARA requires each participating institution to have a federal composite score as measured by the DOE at the parent level of a 1.5 (or a 1.0 with justification acceptable to the state). Neither of our U.S. Institutions participates in NC-SARA because Laureate has a composite score of below 1.0. Accordingly, our U.S. Institutions must apply for and comply with each state's authorization requirements. Many states have established or are proposing legislation to create new or different criteria for authorization of "non-SARA" institutions, including requiring them to post bonds and/or meet composite score requirements. If our U.S. Institutions do not meet these requirements, they may not enroll students in that state. If any of our U.S. Institutions fails to comply with state licensing or authorization requirements for a state that institution could lose its state licensure or authorization by that state, which could prohibit it from recruiting students, providing educational programs and other activities in that state, and fines and penalties. We review the licensure or authorization requirements of other states to determine whether our activities in those states may constitute a presence or otherwise may require licensure or authorization by the respective state education agencies. New laws, regulations or interpretations related to offering educational programs online could increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to recruit students in particular states, which could, in turn, adversely affect our U.S. Institutions' enrollments and revenues. 
         In recent years, the proprietary education industry has experienced broad-based, intensifying scrutiny in the form of increased investigations and enforcement actions. Attorneys general and educational authorizing agencies in several states, as well as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have become more active in enforcing consumer protection laws, especially related to recruiting practices and the financing of education at proprietary educational institutions. 
   State Professional Licensure 
         Many states have specific licensure requirements that an individual must satisfy to be licensed as a professional in specified fields, including fields such as education and healthcare. These requirements vary by state and by field. A student's success in obtaining licensure following graduation typically depends on several factors, which may include, but are not limited to: the background and qualifications of the individual graduate; whether the institution or the program were approved by the applicable state agencies in the state in which the graduate seeks licensure; whether the program from which the student graduated meets all requirements for professional licensure in that state; whether the institution or the program are accredited and, if so, by what accrediting agencies; and whether the institution's degrees are recognized by other states in which a student may seek to work. Several states also require that graduates pass a state test or examination as a prerequisite to becoming certified in certain fields, such as teaching and nursing. In several states, an educational program must be accredited by an accrediting agency affiliated with a professional association in order for graduates to be licensed in that professional field. In the field of psychology, an increasing number of states require approval by either the American Psychological Association ("APA") or the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards ("ASPPB"). To date, Walden University has been unable to obtain approval of its Ph.D. program in Counseling Psychology from the ASPPB or APA. 
         Additionally, under the HEA, proprietary schools generally are eligible to participate in Title IV programs in respect of educational programs that lead to "gainful employment in a recognized occupation." As part of regulations promulgated by the DOE to more specifically define "gainful employment," which became effective on July 1, 2015 and are described in more detail below, the DOE requires each of our U.S. Institutions to certify that its educational programs meet the applicable requirements for graduates to be professionally or occupationally certified in the state in which the institution is located. Failure to provide such certification may result in such programs being ineligible for Title IV program funds. Due to GE certification requirements, it is possible that several programs offered by our schools may be adversely affected by this requirement due to lack of specialized program accreditation, licensure, or certification in the states in which such institutions are based. 
 37



  Accreditation 
         Accreditation is a private, non-governmental process for evaluating the quality of educational institutions and their programs in areas, including student performance, governance, integrity, educational quality, faculty, physical resources, administrative capability and resources and financial stability. To be recognized by the DOE, accrediting agencies must comply with DOE regulations, which require, among other things, that accrediting agencies adopt specific standards for their review of educational institutions, conduct peer review evaluations of institutions and publicly designate those institutions that meet their criteria. An accredited institution is subject to periodic review or review when necessary by its accrediting agencies to determine whether it continues to meet the performance, integrity and quality required for accreditation. Walden University is institutionally accredited by the Higher Learning Commission, a regional accrediting agency recognized by the DOE. NewSchool of Architecture and Design is institutionally accredited by the WASC Senior College and University Commission ("WSCUC"). Accreditation by these accrediting agencies is important to us for several reasons, one being that it enables eligible students at our U.S. Institutions to receive Title IV financial aid. In addition, other colleges and universities depend, in part, on an institution's accreditation in evaluating transfers of credit and applications to graduate schools. Employers also rely on the accredited status of institutions when evaluating candidates' credentials, and students and corporate and government sponsors under tuition reimbursement programs consider accreditation as assurance that an institution maintains quality educational standards. If any of our U.S. Institutions fails to satisfy the standards of its respective accrediting agency, that institution could lose its accreditation by that accrediting agency, which would cause it to lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. 
         The HEA and regulations issued by the DOE require accrediting agencies to monitor the growth of institutions that they accredit. Our U.S. Institutions' respective accrediting agencies require all affiliated institutions, including us, to complete an annual data report. If the non-financial data, particularly enrollment information, and any other information submitted by the institution indicate problems, rapid change or significant growth, the staff of the respective accrediting agency may require that the institution address any concerns arising from the data report in the next self-study and visit process or may recommend additional monitoring. In addition, DOE regulations require the Higher Learning Commission to notify the DOE if an institution it accredits that offers distance learning programs, such as Walden University, experiences an increase in its headcount enrollment of 50% or more in any fiscal year. The DOE may consider that information in connection with its own regulatory oversight activities. 
         In addition to institution-wide accreditation, there are numerous specialized accrediting agencies that accredit specific programs or schools within their jurisdiction, many of which are in healthcare and professional fields. Accreditation of specific programs by one of these specialized accrediting agencies signifies that those programs have met the additional standards of those agencies. In addition to being accredited by regional and/or national accrediting agencies, Walden University also has the following specialized accreditations:
 

 the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs accredits the M.S. in Clinical Mental Health Counseling, M.S. in
Marriage, Couple and Family Counseling, M.S. in Addictions Counseling, M.S. in School Counseling and Ph.D. in Counselor Education and Supervision programs; 
 the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education accredits the Bachelor of Science in Nursing, Master of Science in Nursing and Doctor of Nursing
Practice programs; 
 the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs accredits the B.S. in Business Administration, Master of Business Administration,
Doctor of Business Administration and Ph.D. in Management programs and granted Specialized Accounting Accreditation to the B.S. in Accounting and M.S. in Accounting programs; 

 38

   

 the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (formerly the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education) accredits the
Richard W. Riley College of Education and Leadership; 
 the Project Management Institute Global Accreditation Center for Project Management Education Program accredits the M.S. in Project Management
program; 
 the ABET accredits the B.S. in Information Technology online program; 
 the Council on Social Work Education accredits the master's in social work program, and the bachelor's in social work program holds candidacy
status; and 
 The Master's in Public Health program is an applicant for accreditation by the Council on Education for Public Health. 

 In addition, the National Architecture Accrediting Board accredits NewSchool of Architecture and Design's professional architecture programs. 
         If we fail to satisfy the standards of any of these specialized accrediting agencies, we could lose the specialized accreditation for the affected programs, which could result in materially reduced student enrollments in those programs. 
   Congressional Hearings and Related Actions 
         The U.S. Congress must authorize and appropriate funding for Title IV programs under the HEA and can change the laws governing Title IV programs at any time. Congress reauthorizes the Higher Education Act, which governs federal financial assistance for higher education, approximately every five to eight years. However, the HEA was most recently reauthorized in August 2008. Congress is considering the reauthorization of HEA and is expected to conduct hearings examining various issues relating to the HEA, such as accreditation reform, Title IV disbursement and institutional accountability. It is possible there will be new HEA reauthorization bills and oversight hearings in this Congress. We cannot predict the timing and terms of any eventual HEA reauthorization, including any potential changes to institutional participation or student eligibility requirements or funding levels for particular Title IV programs. 
         In addition to comprehensive reauthorizations of the HEA, Congress may periodically revise the law and other statutory requirements governing Title IV programs. In addition to Title IV programs, eligible veterans and military personnel may receive educational benefits under other federal programs. Congress has the authority to determine the funding levels for Title IV programs, and programs benefiting eligible veterans and military personnel. 
   Regulation of Federal Student Financial Aid Programs 
         To be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, an institution must comply with specific requirements contained in the HEA and the regulations issued thereunder by the DOE. An institution must, among other things, be licensed or authorized to offer its educational programs by the state or states in which it is located and maintain institutional accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized by the DOE. The substantial amount of federal funds disbursed to schools through Title IV programs, the large number of students and institutions participating in these programs and allegations of fraud and abuse by certain for-profit educational institutions have caused Congress to require the DOE to exercise considerable regulatory oversight over for-profit educational institutions. As a result, for-profit educational institutions, including ours, are subject to extensive oversight and review. Because the DOE periodically revises its regulations and changes its interpretations of existing laws and regulations, we cannot predict with certainty how the Title IV program requirements will be applied in all circumstances. 
 39

           Significant aspects of Title IV programs include the following: 
  Eligibility and certification procedures.    Each of our U.S. Institutions must apply periodically to the DOE for continued certification to participate in Title IV programs. Such recertification generally is required every six years, but may be required earlier, including when an institution undergoes a change in control. An institution may also come under the DOE's review when it expands its activities in certain ways, such as opening an additional location, adding a new educational program or modifying the academic credentials it offers. The DOE may place an institution on provisional certification status if it finds that the institution does not fully satisfy all of the eligibility and certification standards and in certain other circumstances, such as when an institution is certified for the first time or undergoes a change in control. During the period of provisional certification, the institution must comply with any additional conditions included in the institution's program participation agreement with the DOE. In addition, the DOE may more closely review an institution that is provisionally certified if it applies for recertification or approval to open a new location, add an educational program, acquire another institution or make any other significant change. If the DOE determines that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement, it may seek to revoke the institution's certification to participate in Title IV programs without advance notice or opportunity for the institution to challenge the action. Students attending provisionally certified institutions remain eligible to receive Title IV program funds. Each of our U.S. Institutions currently is provisionally certified to participate in Title IV programs. They are also subject to a letter of credit for not satisfying the DOE's standards of financial responsibility, as described below. In addition, they are subject to additional cash management requirements with respect to their disbursements of Title IV funds, as well as certain additional reporting and disclosure requirements. 
  Gainful employment.    Under the HEA, proprietary schools generally are eligible to participate in Title IV programs for educational programs that lead to "gainful employment in a recognized occupation." On October 30, 2014, the DOE published regulations to define "gainful employment," which become effective on July 1, 2015. Historically, the concept of "gainful employment" has not been defined in detail. The regulations require each educational program offered by a proprietary institution to achieve threshold rates in two debt measure categories: an annual debt-to-annual earnings ("DTE") ratio and an annual debt-to-discretionary income ("DTI") ratio. 
         An educational program must achieve a DTE ratio at or below 8% or a DTI ratio at or below 20% to be considered "passing." An educational program with a DTE ratio greater than 8% but less than or equal to 12% or a DTI ratio greater than 20% but less than or equal to 30% is considered to be "in the zone." An educational program with a DTE ratio greater than 12% and a DTI ratio greater than 30% is considered "failing." An educational program will cease to be eligible for students to receive Title IV program funds if its DTE and DTI ratios are failing in two out of any three consecutive award years or if both of those rates are failing or in the zone for four consecutive award years. 
         The regulations also require an institution to provide warnings to current and prospective students in programs which may lose Title IV eligibility at the end of an award or fiscal year. If an educational program could become ineligible based on its ratios for the next award year, the institution must (1) deliver a warning to current and prospective students in the program and (2) not enroll, register or enter into a financial commitment with a prospective student until three business days after the warning is provided or a subsequent warning is provided, if more than thirty days have passed since the first warning. If a program becomes ineligible for students to receive Title IV program funds, the institution cannot seek to reestablish eligibility of that program, or establish the eligibility of a similar program having the same classification of instructional program ("CIP") code with the same first four digits of the CIP code of the ineligible program for three years. In January 2017, the DOE issued the first-year final DTE rates to institutions. Of the programs currently offered by NewSchool of Architecture and Design and Walden University, only three programs were in the zone. 
 40

           Additionally, the regulations require an institution to certify to the DOE that its educational programs subject to the gainful employment requirements, which include all programs offered by our U.S. Institutions, meet the applicable requirements for graduates to be professionally or occupationally licensed or certified in the state in which the institution is located. If we are unable to certify that our programs meet the applicable state requirements for graduates to be professionally or occupationally certified in that state, then we may need to cease offering certain programs in certain states or to students who are residents in certain states. 
         The regulations also include requirements for the reporting of student and program data by institutions to the DOE and expand the disclosure requirements that have been in effect since July 1, 2011. The failure of any program or programs offered by any of our U.S. Institutions to satisfy any gainful employment regulations could render that program or programs ineligible for Title IV program funds and we may choose to cease offering the program or programs. Due to GE certification requirements, it is possible that several programs offered by our schools may be adversely affected by the regulations due to lack of specialized program accreditation, licensure, or certification in the states in which such institutions are based. We also could be required to make changes to certain programs at our U.S. Institutions or to increase student loan repayment efforts in order to comply with the rule or to avoid the uncertainty associated with such compliance. 
         The DOE decided to review its gainful employment regulations by negotiated rulemaking in early 2018, but failed to meet consensus on the DOE's proposed regulatory changes. On August 14, 2018, the DOE released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking which would rescind its gainful employment regulations and related requirements. Comments were due September 13, 2018. The DOE did not meet the master calendar deadline of November 1 to issue a new regulation to rescind the gainful employment requirements, and therefore it is not clear when any new such regulation to repeal these regulations will become effective. While the DOE has required institutions to continue to report data to the DOE, it has not issued new GE metrics for institutions and has delayed certain disclosure requirements. We cannot predict with any certainty the outcome of the DOE's proposal to rescind the gainful employment regulations or the extent to which it ultimately proposes gainful employment regulations that differ from the current regulations. 
  Administrative capability.    DOE regulations specify extensive criteria by which an institution must establish that it has the requisite "administrative capability" to participate in Title IV programs. To meet the administrative capability standards, an institution must, among other things: comply with all applicable Title IV program requirements; have an adequate number of qualified personnel to administer Title IV programs; have acceptable standards for measuring the satisfactory academic progress of its students; not have student loan cohort default rates above specified levels; have various procedures in place for awarding, disbursing and safeguarding Title IV program funds and for maintaining required records; administer Title IV programs with adequate checks and balances in its system of internal controls; not be, and not have any principal or affiliate who is, debarred or suspended from federal contracting or engaging in activity that is cause for debarment or suspension; provide financial aid counseling to its students; refer to the DOE's Office of Inspector General any credible information indicating that any student, parent, employee, third-party servicer or other agent of the institution has engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV programs; submit all required reports and financial statements in a timely manner; and not otherwise appear to lack administrative capability. If an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria, the DOE may require the institution to repay Title IV funds its students previously received, change the institution's method of receiving Title IV program funds, which in some cases may result in a significant delay in the institution's receipt of those funds, place the institution on provisional certification status or commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate the institution's participation in Title IV programs. If the DOE determines that any of our U.S. Institutions failed to satisfy its 
 41

   administrative capability requirements, then the institution's students could lose, or be limited in their access to, Title IV program funding. 
  Financial responsibility.    The HEA and DOE regulations establish extensive standards of financial responsibility that institutions such as ours must satisfy to participate in Title IV programs. The DOE evaluates institutions for compliance with these standards on an annual basis based on the institution's annual audited financial statements as well as when the institution applies to the DOE to have its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs recertified. The most significant financial responsibility standard is the institution's composite score, which is derived from a formula established by the DOE based on three financial ratios: (1) equity ratio, which measures the institution's capital resources, financial viability and ability to borrow; (2) primary reserve ratio, which measures the institution's ability to support current operations from expendable resources; and (3) net income ratio, which measures the institution's ability to operate at a profit or within its means. The DOE assigns a strength factor to the results of each of these ratios on a scale from negative 1.0 to positive 3.0, with negative 1.0 reflecting financial weakness and positive 3.0 reflecting financial strength. The DOE then assigns a weighting percentage to each ratio and adds the weighted scores for the three ratios together to produce a composite score for the institution. The composite score must be at least 1.5 for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without the need for further DOE oversight. In addition to having an acceptable composite score, an institution must, among other things, provide the administrative resources necessary to comply with Title IV program requirements, meet all of its financial obligations including required refunds to students and any Title IV liabilities and debts, be current in its debt payments and not receive an adverse, qualified or disclaimed opinion by its accountants in its audited financial statements. 
         If the DOE determines that an institution does not meet the financial responsibility standards due to a failure to meet the composite score or other factors, the institution is able to establish financial responsibility on an alternative basis permitted by the DOE. This alternative basis could include, in the Department's discretion, posting a letter of credit, accepting provisional certification, complying with additional DOE monitoring requirements, agreeing to receive Title IV program funds under an arrangement other than the DOE's standard advance funding arrangement, such as the reimbursement method of payment or heightened cash monitoring, or complying with or accepting other limitations on the institution's ability to increase the number of programs it offers or the number of students it enrolls. 
         The DOE measures the financial responsibility of our U.S. Institutions on the basis of the Laureate consolidated audited financial statements and not at the individual institution level. Based on Laureate's composite score for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the DOE determined that it, and consequently, Walden University and NewSchool of Architecture and Design failed to meet the standards of financial responsibility. As a result, in a letter sent to Laureate on November 20, 2018, the DOE required Laureate to increase its existing letter of credit to $139,002,398 (15% of Title IV program funds that the schools received during the most recently completed fiscal year), continued the institutions on Heightened Cash Monitoring 1 and required Laureate to continue to comply with additional notification and reporting requirements, including submitting bi-weekly cash flow statements for Laureate and monthly student rosters of the institutions, which has been a requirement since April 2018. The DOE has calculated a composite score for Walden unofficially for state authorization purposes, and the score is 2.9 out of a possible 3.0. 
         Any requirement to provide, maintain or increase a letter of credit or other sanctions that may be imposed by the DOE could increase our cost of regulatory compliance and could affect our cash flows. The DOE has the discretion to increase our letter of credit requirements at any time. If our U.S. Institutions are unable to meet the minimum composite score requirement or comply with the other standards of financial responsibility, and could not post a required letter of credit or comply with the 
 42

   alternative bases for establishing financial responsibility, then students at our U.S. Institutions could lose their access to Title IV program funding. 
         On November 1, 2016, as part of its defense to repayment rulemaking, the DOE issued a rule to revise its general standards of financial responsibility to include various actions and events that would require institutions to provide the DOE with irrevocable letters of credit upon the occurrence of certain triggering events. Due to litigation, these regulations are reinstated as of October, 2018. For additional information regarding this rule and the current rulemaking, see "DOE rulemaking activities." 
         When a student who has received Title IV funds withdraws from school, the institution must determine the amount of Title IV program funds the student has "earned." The institution must return any unearned Title IV program funds to the appropriate lender or the DOE in a timely manner, which is generally no later than 45 days after the date the institution determined that the student withdrew. If such payments are not timely made, the institution will be required to submit a letter of credit to the DOE equal to 25% of the Title IV funds that the institution should have returned for withdrawn students in its most recently completed fiscal year. Under DOE regulations, late returns of Title IV program funds for 5% or more of the withdrawn students in the audit sample in the institution's annual Title IV compliance audit for either of the institution's two most recent fiscal years or in a DOE program review triggers this letter of credit requirement. 
         The "90/10 Rule."    A requirement of the HEA commonly referred to as the "90/10 Rule" provides that an institution loses its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, if, under a complex regulatory formula that requires cash basis accounting and other adjustments to the calculation of revenue, the institution derives more than 90% of its revenues for any fiscal year from Title IV program funds. This rule applies only to for-profit post-secondary educational institutions, including our U.S. Institutions. An institution is subject to loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if it exceeds the 90% threshold for two consecutive fiscal years, and an institution whose rate exceeds 90% for any single fiscal year will be placed on provisional certification and may be subject to addition conditions or sanctions imposed by the DOE. 
         Using the DOE's formula under the "90/10 Rule," NewSchool of Architecture and Design derived approximately 36%, 35% and 37% of its revenues (calculated on a cash basis) from Title IV program funds in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Walden University derived approximately 76%, 73% and 73% of its revenues (calculated on a cash basis) from Title IV program funds in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
         The ability of our U.S. Institutions to maintain 90/10 rates below 90% will depend on our enrollments, any increases in students Title IV funding eligibility in the future, and other factors outside of our control, including any reduction in government assistance for military personnel, including veterans, or changes in the treatment of such funding for the purposes of the 90/10 calculation. In recent years, several members of Congress have introduced proposals and legislation that would modify the 90/10 Rule. One such proposal would revise the 90/10 Rule to an 85/15 rule and would count DoD tuition assistance and GI Bill education benefits toward that limit. We cannot predict whether, or the extent to which, these actions could result in legislation or further rulemaking affecting the 90/10 Rule. 
  Student loan defaults.    Under the HEA, an educational institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all Title IV programs if defaults by its students on the repayment of federal student loans received under Title IV programs exceed certain levels. For each federal fiscal year, the DOE calculates a rate of student defaults on such loans for each institution, known as a "cohort default rate." Under current regulations, an institution will lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if its three-year cohort default rate equals or exceeds 30% for three consecutive cohort years or 40% for any given year. 
 43

           The DOE generally publishes official cohort default rates annually in September for the repayment period that ended the prior September 30. NewSchool of Architecture and Design's official cohort default rates for the 2015, 2014 and 2013 federal fiscal years were 7.4%, 5.2% and 5.1%, respectively. Walden University's official cohort default rates for the 2015, 2014 and 2013 federal fiscal years were 7.3%, 7.5% and 6.7%, respectively. The average national student loan default rates published by the DOE for all institutions that participated in the federal student aid programs for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were 10.8%, 11.5% and 11.3%, respectively, and for all proprietary institutions that participated in the federal student aid programs for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were 15.6%, 15.5% and 15.0%, respectively. 
  Incentive compensation rule.    Under the HEA an institution participating in Title IV programs may not pay any commission, bonus or other incentive payments to any person involved in student recruitment or admissions or awarding of Title IV program funds, if such payments are based in any part, directly or indirectly, on success in enrolling students or obtaining student financial aid. Failure to comply could result in monetary penalties and/or sanctions imposed by the DOE, which could result in lower enrollments, revenue, and net operating income. The law and regulations governing this requirement do not establish clear criteria for compliance in all circumstances, creating uncertainty about what constitutes incentive compensation and which employees are covered by the regulation, rendering development of effective and compliant performance metrics more difficult to establish. 
         In addition, in recent years, other post-secondary educational institutions have been named as defendants to whistleblower lawsuits, known as "qui tam" cases, brought by current or former employees pursuant to the Federal False Claims Act, alleging that their institutions' compensation practices did not comply with the incentive compensation rule. A qui tam case is a civil lawsuit brought by one or more individuals (a "relator") on behalf of the federal government for an alleged submission to the government of a false claim for payment. The relator, often a current or former employee, is entitled to a share of the government's recovery in the case, including the possibility of treble damages. 
  Substantial misrepresentation.    The DOE has specific rules prohibiting substantial misrepresentations to students, members of the public, accrediting agencies and state licensing agencies, as well as the DOE. In the event that the DOE determines that an institution engaged in a substantial misrepresentation, it can revoke the institution's program participation agreement, impose limitations on the institution's participation in Title IV programs, deny participation applications on behalf of the institution, or seek to fine, suspend or terminate the institution's participation in Title IV programs. These regulations provide grounds for private litigants to seek to enforce the expanded regulations through False Claims Act litigation. 
  Compliance reviews.    Our U.S. Institutions are subject to announced and unannounced compliance reviews and audits by various external agencies, including the DOE, its Office of Inspector General, state licensing agencies, various state approving agencies for financial assistance to veterans and accrediting agencies. In general, after the DOE conducts a site visit and reviews data supplied by an institution, the DOE sends the institution a program review report and affords the institution with an opportunity to respond to any findings. The DOE then issues a final program review determination letter, which identifies any liabilities. 
         The Higher Learning Commission conducted an on-site mid-cycle review of Walden University on May 1, 2017. The Higher Learning Commission determined that Walden University met the accreditation criteria, with the exception of two, for which it is requiring the school to submit follow-up reports. Specifically, Walden University was required to submit an interim report by May 2018 regarding its progress in addressing the "material weakness" (pertaining to Laureate's control over information technology systems) as identified by its auditors in its December 31, 2016 financial statements, and must submit a second interim report by May 2019 regarding retention and graduation rate improvements to doctoral programs. 
 44

           On September 8, 2016, MOHE sent to Walden University an information request regarding its doctoral programs and complaints filed by doctoral students as part of a program review MOHE is conducting and we have responded to this request. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of this matter. 
         As part of the DOE's ongoing monitoring of institutions' administration of Title IV programs, the HEA also requires institutions to annually submit to the DOE a Title IV compliance audit conducted by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with applicable federal and DOE audit standards. In addition, to enable the DOE to make a determination of an institution's financial responsibility, each institution must annually submit audited financial statements prepared in accordance with DOE regulations. 
  Borrower Defense-to-Repayment.    On November 1, 2016, the DOE published a rule that, among other provisions, established new standards and processes for determining whether a Direct Loan Program borrower has a defense to repayment ("DTR") on a loan due to acts or omissions by the institution at which the loan was used by the borrower for educational expenses (the "2016 DTR regulations"). The 2016 DTR regulations were to take effect on July 1, 2017. On June 15, 2017, the DOE announced an indefinite delay to its implementation of the 2016 DTR regulations, and on June 16, 2017 published a notice of intent to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to develop proposed revisions to the rule. 
         Among other topics, the 2016 DTR regulations established permissible borrower defense claims for discharge, procedural rules under which claims would be adjudicated, time limits for borrowers' claims, and guidelines for recoupment by the DOE of discharged loan amounts from institutions of higher education. They also prohibited schools from using any pre-dispute arbitration agreements, prohibited schools from prohibiting relief in the form of class actions by student borrowers, and invalidated clauses imposing requirements that students pursue an internal dispute resolution process before contacting authorities regarding concerns about an institution. For proprietary institutions, the 2016 DTR regulations described the threshold for loan repayment rates that would require specific disclosures to current and prospective students and the applicable loan repayment rate methodology. The 2016 DTR regulations also established new financial responsibility and administrative capacity requirements for both not-for-profit and for-profit institutions participating in the Title IV programs. Under the 2016 DTR regulations, certain events would automatically trigger a letter of credit, and the DOE retained discretion to impose a letter of credit upon the occurrence of other events. 
         The DOE held negotiated rulemaking sessions in early 2018 regarding the DTR regulations. The DOE and negotiators failed to reach consensus on revised DTR regulations. On July 31, 2018, the DOE published in the Federal Register a proposed rule which would replace most substantive provisions of the 2016 DTR regulations, with a 30-day public comment period. The DOE did not issue a final rule by November 1, 2018, however it is possible the DOE may implement these revised rules or seek to further revise these rules prior to implementation. 
         On July 6, 2017, the attorneys general of 18 states and the District of Columbia filed suit against the DOE claiming that its delay of the 2016 DTR regulations violated applicable law, including the Administrative Procedure Act. Through a series of orders dated September 12 and 17, and October 12, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia held that procedural delays by the DOE in implementing the 2016 DTR regulations were improper and required that the 2016 DTR regulations be reinstated as of October 16, 2018. 
  DOE Rulemaking Activities.    On July 31, 2018, the DOE published a notice in the Federal Register announcing its intention to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to draft proposed regulations regarding topics such as distance education, accreditation, innovation, competency-based programs, faith-based institutions and TEACH grants. The first two of the three scheduled negotiated rulemaking 
 45

   committee meetings took place in January and February 2019 and the last one is scheduled to take place in March 2019. 
  Privacy of student records.    The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 ("FERPA"), and the DOE's FERPA regulations require educational institutions to protect the privacy of students' educational records by limiting an institution's disclosure of a student's personally identifiable information without the student's prior written consent. FERPA also requires institutions to allow students to review and request changes to their educational records maintained by the institution, to notify students at least annually of this inspection right and to maintain records in each student's file listing requests for access to and disclosures of personally identifiable information and the interest of such party in that information. If an institution fails to comply with FERPA, the DOE may require corrective actions by the institution or may terminate an institution's receipt of further federal funds. In addition, our U.S. Institutions are obligated to safeguard student information pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the "GLBA"), a federal law designed to protect consumers' personal financial information held by financial institutions and other entities that provide financial services to consumers. The GLBA and the applicable GLBA regulations require an institution to, among other things, develop and maintain a comprehensive, written information security program designed to protect against the unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable financial information of students, parents or other individuals with whom such institution has a customer relationship. If an institution fails to comply with the applicable GLBA requirements, it may be required to take corrective actions, be subject to monitoring and oversight by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), and be subject to fines or penalties imposed by the FTC. For-profit educational institutions are also subject to the general deceptive practices jurisdiction of the FTC with respect to their collection, use and disclosure of student information. The institution must also comply with the FTC Red Flags Rule, a section of the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, that requires the establishment of guidelines and policies regarding identity theft related to student credit accounts. 
  Potential effect of regulatory violations.    If any of our U.S. Institutions fails to comply with the regulatory standards governing Title IV programs, the DOE could impose one or more sanctions, including requiring us to repay Title IV program funds, requiring us to post a letter of credit in favor of the DOE as a condition for continued Title IV certification, taking emergency action against us, initiating proceedings to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate our participation in Title IV programs or referring the matter for civil or criminal prosecution. Because our U.S. Institutions are provisionally certified to participate in Title IV programs, the DOE may revoke the certification of these institutions without advance notice or advance opportunity for us to challenge that action. 
         In addition to the actions that may be brought against us as a result of our participation in Title IV programs, we are also subject to complaints and lawsuits relating to regulatory compliance brought not only by regulatory agencies, but also by other government agencies and third parties, such as current or former students or employees and other members of the public. 
   Regulatory Standards that May Restrict Institutional Expansion or Other Changes in the United States 
         Many actions that we may wish to take in connection with expanding our operations or other changes in the United States are subject to review or approval by the applicable regulatory agencies. 
  Implementing new educational programs and increasing enrollment.    The requirements and standards of state education agencies, accrediting agencies and the DOE limit our ability in certain instances to implement new educational programs or increase enrollment in certain programs. Many states require review and approval before institutions can add new programs. Our U.S. Institutions' state educational agencies and institutional and specialized accrediting agencies that authorize or accredit our U.S. Institutions and their programs generally require institutions to notify them in advance of implementing 
 46

   new programs, and upon notification may undertake a review of the quality of the facility or the program and the financial, academic and other qualifications of the institution. 
         With respect to the DOE, if an institution participating in Title IV programs plans to add a new educational program, the institution must generally apply to the DOE to have the additional educational program designated as within the scope of the institution's Title IV eligibility. As a condition for an institution to participate in Title IV programs on a provisional basis, as in our case, the DOE can require prior approval of such programs or otherwise restrict the number of programs an institution may add or the extent to which an institution can modify existing educational programs. If an institution that is required to obtain the DOE's advance approval for the addition of a new program fails to do so, the institution may be liable for repayment of the Title IV program funds received by the institution or students in connection with that program. 
         Provisional certification.    Each institution must apply to the DOE for continued certification to participate in Title IV programs at least every six years and when it undergoes a change in control. An institution may also come under the DOE's review when it expands its activities in certain ways, such as opening an additional location, adding an educational program or modifying the academic credentials that it offers. 
         The DOE may place an institution on provisional certification status if it finds that the institution does not fully satisfy all of the eligibility and certification standards. In addition, if a company acquires an institution from another entity, the acquired institution will automatically be placed on provisional certification when the DOE approves the transaction. During the period of provisional certification, the institution must comply with any additional conditions or restrictions included in its program participation agreement with the DOE. Students attending provisionally certified institutions remain eligible to receive Title IV program funds, but if the DOE finds that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement, it may seek to revoke the institution's certification to participate in Title IV programs without advance notice or advance opportunity for the institution to challenge that action. In addition, the DOE may more closely review an institution that is provisionally certified if it applies for recertification or approval to open a new location, add an educational program, acquire another institution or make any other significant change. All of our U.S. Institutions currently participate in Title IV programs pursuant to provisional participation agreements due to our conversion to a public benefit corporation and our initial public offering, as well as because we do not meet the DOE's standards of financial responsibility. 
  Acquiring other institutions.    We have acquired other institutions in the past, and we may seek to do so in the future. The DOE and virtually all state education agencies and accrediting agencies require a company to obtain their approval if it wishes to acquire another institution. The level of review varies by individual state and accrediting agency, with some requiring approval of such an acquisition before it occurs while others only consider approval after the acquisition has occurred. The approval of the applicable state education agencies and accrediting agencies is a necessary prerequisite to the DOE certifying the acquired institution to participate in Title IV programs. The restrictions imposed by any of the applicable regulatory agencies could delay or prevent our acquisition of other institutions in some circumstances or could delay the ability of an acquired institution to participate in Title IV programs. 
  Change in ownership resulting in a change in control.    The DOE and many states and accrediting agencies require institutions of higher education to report or obtain approval of certain changes in control and changes in other aspects of institutional organization or control. Under DOE's regulations, an institution that undergoes a change in control loses its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and must apply to the DOE to reestablish such eligibility. If an institution files the required application and follows other procedures, the DOE may temporarily certify the institution on a provisional basis following the change in control, so that the institution's students retain continued access to Title IV 
 47

   program funds. In addition, the DOE may extend such temporary provisional certification if the institution timely files certain required materials, including the approval of the change in control by its state authorizing agency and accrediting agency and certain financial information pertaining to the financial condition of the institution or its parent corporation. 
         The types of and thresholds for such reporting and approval vary among the states and accrediting agencies. Certain accrediting agencies may require that an institution must obtain its approval in advance of a change in control, structure or organization for the institution to retain its accredited status. In addition, in the event of a change in control, structure or organization, certain accrediting agencies may require a post-transaction focused visit or other evaluation to review the appropriateness of its approval of the change and whether the institution has met the commitment it made to the accrediting agency prior to the approval. Other specialized accrediting agencies also require an institution to obtain similar approval before or after the event that constitutes a change in control under their standards. Many states include the transfer of a controlling interest of common stock in the definition of a change in control requiring approval. Some state educational agencies that regulate us may require us to obtain approval of the change in control to maintain authorization to operate in that state, and in some cases such states could require us to obtain advance approval of a change in control.
