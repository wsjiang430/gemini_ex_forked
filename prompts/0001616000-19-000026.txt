Item 1. Business 
General
Xenia Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (the "Company" or "Xenia") is a Maryland corporation that invests primarily in uniquely positioned luxury and upper upscale hotels and resorts, with a focus on Top 25 Markets and key leisure destinations in the United States ("U.S."). 
Substantially all of the Company's assets are held by, and all the operations are conducted through our Operating Partnership. XHR GP, Inc. is the sole general partner of Operating Partnership. XHR GP, Inc. is wholly owned by the Company. On December 31, 2018, the Company collectively owned 97.5% of the common limited partnership units issued by the Operating Partnership ("Operating Partnership Units"). The remaining 2.5% of the common limited partnership units are owned by the other limited partners comprised of our current executive officers and members of our Board of Directors and includes unvested long term incentive plan ("LTIP") partnership units, which may or may not vest based on the passage of time and meeting certain market-based performance objectives. To qualify as a REIT, the Company cannot operate or manage its hotels. Therefore, the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries lease the hotel properties to XHR Holding, the Company's TRS, which engages third-party eligible independent operators to manage the hotels. The third-party non-affiliated hotel operators manage each hotel pursuant to a hotel management agreement, the terms of which are discussed in more detail under "Part I-Item 2. Our Principal Agreements."
The Company's consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, the Operating Partnership, XHR Holding, as well as all wholly owned subsidiaries. The Company's subsidiaries generally consist of limited liability companies ("LLCs"), limited partnerships ("LPs") and our TRS. The effects of all inter-company transactions are eliminated. 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company owned 40 lodging properties with a total of 11,165 rooms.
The Company’s principal executive offices are located at 200 S. Orange Avenue, Suite 2700, Orlando, Florida, 32801, and our telephone number is (407) 246-8100. The Company’s website is www.xeniareit.com.

Business Objectives and Growth Strategies
Our objective is to allocate capital in order to invest primarily in a high-quality diversified portfolio of uniquely positioned luxury and upper upscale hotels and resorts in the Top 25 Markets and key leisure destinations in the U.S. We invest at valuation levels which we believe will generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. We pursue this objective through the following investment and growth strategies: 

• | Pursue Differentiated Investment Strategy Across Targeted Markets. We use our management team’s network of relationships in the lodging industry, real estate brokers and our relationships with multiple hotel brands and management companies, among others, to source acquisition opportunities. When evaluating opportunities, we use a multi-pronged approach to investing that we believe provides us the flexibility to pursue attractive opportunities in a variety of markets across any point in the cycle. We consider the following characteristics when making investment decisions: 


- | Market Characteristics. We seek opportunities across a range of urban and dense suburban areas, primarily in the Top 25 Markets and key leisure destinations, in the U.S. We believe that this strategy provides us with a broader range of opportunities and allows us to target markets and sub-markets with particular positive characteristics, such as multiple demand generators, favorable supply and demand dynamics, and attractive long-term projected RevPAR growth. We believe assets in the Top 25 Markets and key leisure destinations present attractive investment opportunities considering the favorable supply and demand dynamics, RevPAR growth trends, attractive valuations and better opportunities for diversification.


- | Asset Characteristics. We generally pursue uniquely positioned hotels in the upper upscale and luxury segments that are affiliated with leading premium brands, as we believe these segments yield attractive risk-adjusted returns. Within these segments, we seek hotels that will provide guests with a distinctive lodging experience, tailored to reflect local market environments rather than investing primarily in properties that are heavily dependent on conventions and group business. We seek properties with desirable locations within their markets, exceptional facilities, and other competitive advantages that are hard to replicate. We also favor properties that can be purchased below estimated replacement cost. We believe our focus on uniquely positioned luxury and upper upscale hotel assets, allows us to seek appropriate investments that are well suited for specific markets.


- | Operational and Structural Characteristics. We pursue both new or recently constructed assets that require limited capital investment, as well as more mature and complex properties with opportunities for our dedicated asset and project management teams to create value through more active operational oversight and

2

targeted capital expenditures. Additionally, we generally seek properties that are unencumbered by debt and that will not require partnerships with third-party investors, allowing us maximum operational flexibility. 

• | Drive Growth Through Aggressive Asset Management, In-House Project Management and Strategic Capital Investment. We believe that investing in our properties and employing a proactive asset management approach designed to identify investment strategies will optimize internal growth opportunities. Our management team’s extensive industry experience across multiple brands and management companies coupled with our integrated asset management and project management teams, enable us to identify and implement value-add strategies, prudently invest capital in our assets to optimize operating results and leverage best practices across our portfolio.


- | Aggressive Asset Management. Our experienced asset management team focuses on driving property performance through revenue enhancement and cost containment efforts. Our ability to work with a wide variety of management and franchise companies provides us with the opportunity to benchmark performance across our portfolio in order to share best practices. While we do not operate our hotel properties directly, and under the terms of our hotel management agreements our ability to participate in operating decisions regarding our hotels is limited, we conduct regular revenue, sales, and financial performance reviews and also perform in-depth on-site reviews focused on ongoing operating margin improvement initiatives. We interact frequently with our management companies and on-site management personnel, including conducting regular meetings with key executives of our management companies and brands. We work to maximize the value of our assets through all aspects of the hotel operation and ancillary real estate opportunities.


- | In-House Project Management. By maintaining a dedicated in-house capital planning and project management team, we believe we are able to develop our capital plans and execute each renovation project at a lower cost and in a timelier manner than if we outsourced these services. In addition, our project management team has extensive experience in the development and renovation of hotel properties, providing both in-depth knowledge of building construction, as well as the opportunity for us to evaluate potential development opportunities. We view this as a significant competitive strength relative to many of our peers.


- | Strategic Capital Investment to Enhance Portfolio Performance. As part of our ongoing asset management activities, we continuously review opportunities to reinvest in our hotels to maintain quality, increase long-term value and generate attractive returns on invested capital. We also may opportunistically dispose of hotels to take advantage of market conditions or in situations where the hotels no longer fit within our strategic objectives. We believe our breadth of experience and integrated in-house asset management and project management teams are instrumental in our ability to acquire and operate assets and to capitalize on redevelopment opportunities.

Our Financing and Capital Strategy 
Over time, we intend to finance our long-term growth with issuances of common and preferred equity securities, as well as with debt financings utilizing staggered maturities. Our debt includes a senior unsecured revolving credit facility, unsecured term loans, mortgage debt collateralized by our hotel properties or leasehold interests under the ground leases on our hotel properties, and may include other types of private and public debt in the future. 
We strive to maintain a flexible capital structure that puts us in a position to be opportunistic in allocating capital for investment. As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of $161.6 million of cash on hand, including $70.2 million of restricted cash primarily set aside to maintain our hotels. We have and seek to maintain a modest amount of leverage and closely monitor our near-term debt maturities. Our net debt to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ratio as of December 31, 2018 was 3.6x based on actual operating results for the year then ended. Our weighted average debt maturity was 4.8 years, including available extension options, and our debt had a weighted average interest rate of 3.82% as of December 31, 2018 (See "Part II-Item 7. Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for the definition of net debt and its reconciliation to net income).
From time to time, we will also seek to create value for our stockholders by opportunistically repurchasing shares of our common stock at valuations we believe are attractive. We are authorized to repurchase up to $175 million of the Company's outstanding Common Stock (the "Repurchase Program"). The Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date. This Repurchase Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time, and does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of shares. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $96.9 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization. 
We may also issue new equity or debt if we feel that we can accretively use proceeds to acquire assets or make capital improvements that yield attractive risk-adjusted returns on investment. We have an "at-the-market" program ("ATM program") available for selling common stock. We sell common stock under the ATM program from time to time to raise capital when we 
3

believe conditions are advantageous. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we issued 5.7 million shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $24.02 through our ATM program and received gross proceeds of $137.4 million.
We anticipate using a portion of cash flows generated from operations to fund future acquisitions as well as for property redevelopments, return on investment initiatives, working capital requirements, and at times, share repurchase programs. Subject to market conditions, we intend to repay amounts outstanding under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility from time to time with proceeds from periodic common and preferred equity issuances, long-term debt financings, sale of assets and cash flows from operations. 
Competition
The U.S. lodging industry is highly competitive. Our hotels compete with other hotels and alternative accommodation options for guests (e.g. those that are found on websites that facilitate short-term rentals of homes and apartments from owners) in each of their markets on the basis of several factors, including, among others, room rates, quality of accommodations, service levels and amenities, location, brand affiliation, reputation and reservation systems. Competition is often specific to the individual markets in which our hotels are located and includes competition from existing and new hotels and alternative accommodation options. We believe that hotels, such as our portfolio of hotels, that are affiliated with leading national brands, will enjoy the competitive advantages associated with operating under such brands. Increased competition could harm our occupancy and revenues and may require us to provide additional amenities, or make capital improvements that we otherwise would not have to make, and may materially and adversely affect our operating results and liquidity. 
We face competition for the acquisition of hotels from other REITs, private equity firms, institutional investors, hedge funds, specialty finance companies, insurance companies, governmental bodies, foreign investors and other entities. Some of these competitors have substantially greater financial and operational resources and access to capital than we have and may have greater knowledge of the markets in which we seek to invest. This competition may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us and decrease the attractiveness of the terms on which we may acquire our targeted hotel investments, including the cost thereof. In addition, these competitors seek financing through the same channels that we do. Therefore, we compete for funding in a market where funds for real estate investment may decrease, or grow at a rate that is less than the underlying demand. 
Seasonality 
The lodging industry is seasonal in nature which can be expected to cause fluctuations in our hotel rooms revenues, occupancy levels, room rates, operating expenses and cash flows. The periods during which our hotels experience higher or lower levels of demand vary from property to property and depend upon location, type of property, and competitive mix within the specific location. We expect our revenues and operating income to be the highest during the second quarter of the year followed by the first, third and fourth quarters based on our current portfolio composition.
Cyclicality 
The hospitality industry is cyclical and generally its growth or contraction follows the overall economy. There is a history of increases and decreases in demand for and supply of hotel rooms, in occupancy levels and in rates realized by owners of hotels through economic cycles. Variability of results through some of the cycles in the past has been more severe due to changes in the supply of hotel rooms in given markets or in given segments of hotels. The combination of changes in economic conditions and in the supply of hotel rooms can result in significant volatility in results for owners of hotel properties. The costs of running a hotel tend to be more fixed than variable. Because of this, in an environment of declining revenues the rate of decline in earnings will be higher than the rate of decline in revenues. Conversely, in an environment of increasing demand and room rates, the rate of increase in earnings is typically higher than the rate of increase in revenues.
Regulations 
General 
Our hotels are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas and fire and safety requirements. We believe that each of our hotels has the necessary permits and approvals to operate its business. 
Americans with Disabilities Act 
Our hotels must comply with applicable provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (the "ADA"), to the extent that such hotels are "public accommodations" as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our hotels where such removal is readily achievable. We believe that our 
4

hotels are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. However, non-compliance with the ADA could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our hotels and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect. 
Environmental Matters 
Under various laws relating to the protection of the environment, a current or previous owner or operator (including tenants) of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances at that property and may be required to investigate and clean up such contamination at that property or emanating from that property. These costs could be substantial and liability under these laws may attach without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the contaminants, and the liability may be joint and several. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our hotels may expose us to third-party liability or materially and adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop the real estate or to incur debt using the real estate as collateral. 
Our hotels are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that address a wide variety of issues, including, but not limited to, storage tanks, air emissions from emergency generators, storm water and wastewater discharges, lead-based paint, mold and mildew and waste management. Our hotels incur costs to comply with these laws and regulations and could be subject to fines and penalties for noncompliance. 
Some of our hotels contain asbestos-containing building materials. We believe that the asbestos is appropriately contained in accordance with current environmental regulations and that we have no need for any immediate remediation or current plans to remove the asbestos. Environmental laws require that owners or operators of buildings with asbestos-containing building materials properly manage and maintain these materials, adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements. In addition, third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos-containing building materials. 
Some of our hotels may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other adverse conditions, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediation. The presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our hotels could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected hotel or increase indoor ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from guests or employees at our hotels and others if property damage or health concerns arise. 
Our Tax Status 
We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("the Code") for U.S. federal income tax purposes, beginning with our short taxable year that commenced on January 5, 2015 and ended on February 3, 2015. We believe that we have been organized and have operated and will continue to operate in a manner that will allow us to maintain our REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with such short taxable year, and we intend to continue operating in such a manner. To qualify for REIT status, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains. 
We conduct our business through a traditional umbrella partnership real estate investment trust, or UPREIT, in which our hotels are indirectly owned by our Operating Partnership, through subsidiary limited partnerships, limited liability companies or other legal entities. We own and control 100% of the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership and own, directly or indirectly, approximately 97.5% of the Operating Partnership Units in our Operating Partnership, with the remaining 2.5% owned by our current executive officers and members of our Board of Directors. In the future, we may issue additional common or preferred units in our Operating Partnership from time to time in connection with acquisitions of hotels or for financing, compensation or other reasons. 
In order for the income from our hotel operations to constitute "rents from real property" for purposes of the gross income tests required for REIT qualification, we cannot directly or indirectly operate any of our hotels. Accordingly, we lease each of our hotels, and intend to lease any hotels we acquire in the future, to our TRS lessees. As required for our qualification as a REIT, our TRS lessees have engaged third-party hotel management companies to manage our hotels on market terms. Our TRS lessees pay rent to us that we intend to treat as "rents from real property". Our TRS, which owns our TRS lessees, is subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes applicable to corporations and we are generally subject to sales tax on a portion of the rent paid from our TRS lessees.

Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer of Our Stock 
Our charter authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary or appropriate to enable us to maintain our qualification as a REIT. Furthermore, our charter prohibits any one person from actually or constructively owning more than 9.8% in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock. Our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may exempt (prospectively or retroactively) a person from the ownership limits if certain conditions are satisfied. However, our Board of Directors may not grant an exemption from the ownership limits to any proposed transferee whose ownership, direct or indirect, in excess of 9.8% of the value or number of outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock, could jeopardize our status as a REIT. These restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply if our Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a REIT or that compliance with such restrictions is no longer required for us to qualify as a REIT. The ownership limits may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might be in our stockholders' best interest. 
Insurance 
We or our third-party management companies carry commercial general liability, commercial property including extended coverage and business interruption, terrorism, cyber liability and umbrella liability coverage on all of our hotels and earthquake, wind, flood, hurricane and environmental coverage on hotels in areas where we believe such coverage is warranted, in each case with deductibles and limits of liability that we deem adequate. Similarly, we are insured against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts we believe to be adequate to reimburse us, on a replacement basis, for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each hotel, including loss of income during the reconstruction period. We have selected policy specifications and insured limits which we believe to be appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of coverage and industry practice. We do not carry insurance for generally uninsured losses, including, but not limited to, losses caused by riots, war or acts of God which are not insurable. We believe our hotels are adequately insured.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 51 employees. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Our third-party managers are responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels. Although we do not manage employees at our hotels, we are still subject to the many costs and risks generally associated with the labor at our hotels. 
Employees at certain of our third-party managed hotels are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are subject to review and renewal on a regular basis. For a discussion of these relationships, see "Part I-Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business and Industry – We are subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel, particularly with hotels that employ or may employ unionized labor, which could increase our operating costs, reduce the flexibility of our hotel managers to adjust the size of the workforce at our hotels and could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability." 
Our History 
Prior to February 3, 2015, Xenia was a wholly owned subsidiary of InvenTrust Properties Corp. (formerly known as Inland American Real Estate Trust, Inc. or "InvenTrust"), its former parent. On February 3, 2015, Xenia was spun off from InvenTrust through a taxable pro rata distribution by InvenTrust of the outstanding common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Common Stock"), of Xenia to holders of record of InvenTrust's common stock as of the close of business on January 20, 2015 (the "Record Date").  Each holder of record of InvenTrust's common stock received one share of Common Stock for every eight shares of InvenTrust’s common stock held at the close of business on the Record Date (the "Distribution"). In lieu of fractional shares, stockholders of InvenTrust received cash.  In connection with and in order to effectuate the separation and distribution, we and InvenTrust entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement, among other agreements.  These agreements provided for the allocation between us and InvenTrust of InvenTrust’s assets, liabilities and obligations (including its properties, employees and tax-related assets and liabilities) attributable to periods prior to, at and after our separation from InvenTrust and governed certain relationship between us and InvenTrust after the separation.  On February 4, 2015, Xenia’s Common Stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the ticker symbol "XHR."  As a result of the Distribution, the Company became a stand-alone, publicly-traded company.
