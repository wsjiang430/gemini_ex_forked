Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We design and develop innovative neurostimulation products to uniquely and effectively help combat the ongoing global mental health epidemic. We developed an easy-to-administer medical device — referred to as Generation 1 or Gen-1 — that utilizes bioelectronic medical technology to treat anxiety and insomnia, without the need for drugs or psychotherapy. Our original Gen-1 devices are cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) devices that emit waveform at 4 milliamps during treatment and are presently classified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) as a Class II device.
 
Medical professionals in the United States have utilized the Gen-1 device to administer to patients in clinical settings. While the Gen-1 device had been cleared by the FDA to treat depression, anxiety, and insomnia, three prevalent and serious diseases, because of the FDA’s December 2019 reclassification of CES devices, the Gen-1 device was reclassified as a Class II device for the treatment of anxiety and insomnia. We are required to file a new application under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“510(k) Application”) to be approved by the FDA for the sales and marketing of our devices for the treatment of anxiety and insomnia. In the FDA’s December 2019 reclassification ruling, the treatment of depression with our device will require a Class III certification and require a new PMA (premarket approval) application to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 
While we continue providing services to medical professionals to support patients’ use of the Gen-1 devices which were in operation prior to December 2019, we are not making new sales or new marketing efforts of Gen-1 devices. We continue to derive revenue from devices which we sold or leased prior to the FDA’s December 2019 reclassification announcements. This revenue consists of monthly licensing fees and payments for the sale of electrodes. We have suspended marketing efforts for new sales of devices related to the Gen-1 device for treatment of anxiety and insomnia in the United States until the Nexalin regulatory team makes a decision on whether to proceed with a new 510(k) application at 4 milliamps, which determination will be based on FDA comments expected to be received in mid or late spring 2023. Our regulatory team continues to inform the FDA of the suspension of the marketing and sale of the Gen-1 products to new providers.
 
Our Technology
 
We have designed and developed a new advanced waveform technology to be emitted at 15 milliamps through new and improved medical devices referred to as Generation 2 or Gen-2 and Generation 3 or Gen-3. Gen-2 is a clinical use device with a modern enclosure to emit the new 15 milliamp advanced waveform. Gen-3 is a new patient headset that will be prescribed by licensed medical professionals in a virtual clinic setting similar to existing tele-health platforms. The Nexalin research team believes that the new 15 milliamp Gen-2 and Gen-3 devices can penetrate deeper into the brain and stimulate associated structures of mental illness, which we believe will generate enhanced patient response without any risk or unpleasant side effects. The Nexalin regulatory team has made a strategic decision to develop strategies for pilot trials in various mental health disease states. In addition, a new PMA application in the United States is in development for the treatment of depression utilizing both Gen-2 and Gen-3. The new Gen-3 device is also scheduled for additional pilot trials for anxiety and insomnia in the United States and China beginning in the late second quarter or early third quarter of 2023. Preliminary data provided by the University of California San Diego supports the safety of utilizing our 15 milliamp waveform technology. However, the determination of safety and efficacy of medical devices in the United States is subject to clearance by the FDA.
 
Additionally, we are currently designing clinical trial strategies for the use of Gen-3 for the treatment of substance use disorders including opiate, cocaine, and alcohol abuse. Recently the Gen-2 device was tested in pilot trials in China for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, and dementia. Continued pilot testing for Alzheimer’s and dementia is planned in China in 2023.
 
In part due to increased incidence attributed to the devastating impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health and cognitive disorders are widespread across the globe and causing substantial health, social and economic losses, and hardships accordingly. Our focus is on the continued development of our innovative bioelectronic medical technologies and rapid regulatory approval.

Our products are non-invasive, safe, undetectable to the human body and can provide relief to those afflicted with mental health issues without adverse side effects. We have a proprietary design that eliminates voltage while stabilizing currents, electromagnetic fields, and various frequencies — referred to collectively as waveform - particularly our proprietary, 15 milliamp patented symmetrical waveform. Our devices generate a high frequency carrier wave that is charge balanced is applied to the brain with an array of electrodes on the forehead and behind each ear at the mastoid. The features of this proprietary waveform and the array of electrodes allows the application of the waveform to the entire brain rather than a small, targeted area of the brain. To ensure deeper penetration in the brain, we have eliminated the voltage from the waveform which allows the increase of the power from < 4 mAmps to 15 mAmps, more than a 400% increase without incurring any patient discomfort, risk, or adverse side effects. By increasing the power, our waveform can penetrate deeper into the brain and stimulate deep mid-brain structures associated with mental illness. Our research and clinical teams believe that a more powerful waveform will create a stronger response in the brain. A stronger response creates a higher level of efficacy. This entire proprietary technique allows Nexalin to provide a safe and comfortable treatment that is more powerful than any stimulation device in the market. Current pilot study protocols and randomized clinical trials have been designed and submitted to the FDA to provide feedback on final reports and data sets for the purpose of safety and efficacy evaluations in the future. Determinations of the safety and efficacy of our devices are solely within the authority of the FDA.
 
Currently, the waveform that comprises the basis of Gen-2 and new Gen-3 headset devices has been tested in research settings to develop safety data that has been submitted for review by the FDA for safety evaluation and eventual marketing in the United States. Determinations of the safety and efficacy of our devices in the United States are solely within the authority of the FDA.
 
We recognize that an additional barrier to treatment in today’s mental health treatment landscape — beyond the concerns about safety, efficacy and side-effects that have been associated with conventional mental health treatments such as ECT (shock therapy), drugs and psychotherapy is stigma. Industry reports and feedback indicate that many patients that struggle with mood disorders have the stigma of embarrassment associated with psychiatrists and psychotherapy (e.g., counselling with a therapist). Additional stigmas and other issues are associated with the side effects of medication prescribed by psychiatrists. When we researched the current pharmaceuticals model, public information highlighted the many side effects associated with these medications. Frequently, patients would stop taking the medication because of the uncomfortable side effects. Additional public information mentions dependency and withdrawal issues associated with medication for psychiatric disorders.
 
To address the embarrassment stigma, we are developing a new virtual clinic. After diagnosis, the physician can prescribe the Nexalin Gen-3 headset to the patient for treatment. Next, the Gen-3 device will be shipped to the patient’s home. After patient receives the device, they will pair the headset device with an app in the patient’s smart phone. The app will communicate with the Nexalin cloud servers to authorize the device for treatment according to the protocol designed by the physician. The physician will monitor treatment compliance and other health related issues in a private physician dashboard that connects through the Nexalin app and cloud servers. We believe that to preserve product safety and integrity for home use, the headset device will require physician oversight that includes a prescription for use with a monthly authorization provided by the physician after a monthly virtual visit. All appointments will be in a virtual setting to provide privacy and convenience for the physician and patient. The Nexalin virtual clinic will be provided in a proprietary virtual platform which is currently in the design stage.
 
Our China Gen-2 15 milliamp device was recently approved in China by the NMPA for the treatment of insomnia and depression in China. This device and all other clinical devices will include a single use electrode for long term revenue streams.
 
Our USA Gen-2 device will have a fresh and modern appearance that meets the technology standards of the digital tech world of 2023. Early adopters of the Gen-1 device will be able to access additional firmware upgrades which are planned to enhance the previously purchased devices to the new 15-milliamp waveform.
 
Our Gen-2 device is expected to be equipped with RFID technology that exchanges electrode usage data with a reader in the main device. The purpose of RFID is to track and maintain control of the proprietary single use electrode. Our electrode chip will be programmed to exchange data with the device and allow activation for a single treatment with a new electrode only. We anticipate that this will ensure a recurring revenue stream on the device and protects against any generic knockoffs designed to avoid treatment costs. This upgrade in technology also ensures the proprietary nature of the electrodes that support treatment outcomes are sustained.

Potential Joint Venture; China Related Activities
 
In September 2018, we entered into an agreement with Wider Come Limited, a company formed under the laws of the People’s Republic of China (“Wider”), pursuant to which we and Wider have agreed to investigate the formation of a joint venture entity to be domiciled in Hong Kong (the “potential Joint Venture”) to conduct additional clinical research and implement a business distribution plan for our devices in China, Macau, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. We do not have any existing operations in China and will not in the future. We do have current distribution in China through Wider, our potential Joint Venture partner. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, (i) our operations are carried on outside of China; and (ii) the potential Joint Venture does not maintain any variable interest entity structure or operate any data center in China. However, because of the intended formation of the potential Joint Venture, we may become subject to laws of The People’s Republic of China (PRC or China) relating to, among other topics, data security and restrictions over foreign investments. Further, as a result of the complexity and vagaries of the legal system in the PRC and recent statements and regulatory actions by the PRC government relating to data security, our ability to operate the potential Joint Venture may be adversely affected or subject to change and adversely impact our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors, with the result that our securities may significantly decline or be worthless. There can be no assurance that regulators in China will not take a contrary view or will not subsequently require us to undergo the approval procedures and subject us to penalties for non-compliance.
 
In March 2022, we entered into a second supplement to the Joint Venture agreement with Wider whereby the parties confirmed that the potential Joint Venture had not yet been established and is subject to further review and analysis of regulatory issues in China and the United States. Pursuant to the second supplement, the parties agreed to use their commercial efforts to complete documentation by September 30, 2022. In light of general economic conditions in China and the United States, the continued impact of regulatory issues within China and the United States and trade and political issues between the two countries, the parties determined to further extend the time frame to complete establishment of the joint venture to September 30, 2023 and entered into a Supplement 3 to the potential Joint Venture Agreement to memorialize such extension. The parties intend to continue to work together to complete the establishment prior to such extended time. Further, the parties agreed that all references within the Joint Venture agreements to funding and formation were amended from December 21, 2018 to be September 30, 2023. We anticipate that the Joint Venture will be formed by the third quarter of 2023. However, that will be dependent on the situation at that time.
 
When and if the Joint Venture is formed and Wider completes sales of our devices in China on behalf of the potential Joint Venture, we believe that there are no regulatory or other restrictions that would restrict either (i) the transfer from China of any proceeds resulting from such sales by Wider to the potential Joint Venture in Hong Kong, other than standard compliance with China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”) policies and approval process, or (ii) our receipt of our share of such proceeds from Hong Kong to us in the United States, which is not subject to SAFE’s policies and approval process. The Company does not currently believe any of the Company’s scientific data resulting from activities in China by the potential Joint Venture would fall within the Measures for the Management of Scientific Data promulgated by the General Office of the PRC State Council. In the event any existing or new laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations are modified or promulgated, we and the potential Joint Venture will take all actions to remain in compliance with any such laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations thereof. Neither we nor our potential Joint Venture Partner can at this point speak to any future changes in rules, regulations or the commercial and potentials situation that lies ahead which could affect the formation of the Joint Venture.
 
In September of 2021, the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), the equivalent of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), approved the Gen-2 device for marketing and sale in China for the treatment of insomnia and depression. These treatment indications and clearances from the NMPA have allowed Wider to market and sell the Gen-2 device in China for the treatment of insomnia and depression.

Regulatory Background and Matters Related to our Business
 
United States
 
Medical devices commercially distributed in the United States require either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification submission, granting of a de novo request or Premarket Approval (PMA), unless an exemption exists. Under the FFDCA, as administered by the FDA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes — Class I, Class II or Class III — depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Regulatory control increases from Class I to Class III. Prior to December 20, 2019, in the United States, all cranial electrical stimulation (CES) technology was classified as a Class III medical device (high-risk).
 
Class II devices are moderate risk devices and are subject to the FDA’s general controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Such special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents. Most manufacturers of Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FFDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device.
 
Class III devices are deemed the highest risk devices by the FDA and generally include life-sustaining, life-supporting or some implantable devices or devices that have a new intended use or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device. Class III devices require a PMA. For a device that is Class III by default (because it is a novel device that was not previously classified and has no predicate), the manufacturer may request that the FDA reclassify the device into Class II or Class I via a de novo request.
 
To obtain 510(k) clearance, a premarket notification submission must be submitted to the FDA demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I (e.g., via the de novo classification process), or a device that was previously cleared through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) review process usually takes from three to six months but can take longer.
 
After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) marketing clearance or, depending on the modification, a de novo request or PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k), de novo, or a PMA in the first instance. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until FDA has cleared or approved a 510(k), de novo or PMA for the modification.
 
The PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. In a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The PMA must also contain, among other things, a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities and controls used for manufacturing and proposed labelling. Following receipt of a PMA submission, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of a PMA, although in practice, the FDA’s review often takes significantly longer, and can take up to several years.
 
On December 20, 2019, the FDA issued new rulings related to CES devices for the treatment of anxiety, depression, and insomnia. As a result of these rulings, depression treatment with CES devices remained a Class III medical device and will require a full PMA that provides definitive clinical trial evidence of effectiveness and safety. A PMA is the most extensive application and process at the FDA. All CES manufacturers had one year to prepare and file intentions for the depression treatment with a PMA. CES devices that treat anxiety and insomnia were reclassified as Class II devices and required a new application in the form of a special control trial, a summary version of a PMA, requiring safety data and mild efficacy response. All CES manufacturers had one year to complete special control trials for anxiety and insomnia. We are presently analyzing our previous 510(k) Application for such treatment of anxiety and insomnia in accordance with the FDA reclassification ruling in December 2019. Our intent is to move forward with our new 15 milliamp waveform given its success in the China studies. We have also completed 2 prototypes of a Nexalin headset which can be used at home or in a clinical setting. The new headset will utilize the new 15 milliamp waveform. Final prototypes and design for manufacturing is expected in the third quarter of 2023.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, special control trials according to the December 2019 ruling were delayed. In January 2023, we filed a new 510k pre-sub with the FDA for treatment of anxiety and insomnia with the new 15 milliamp Gen-3. Responses from the FDA are expected in the second or third quarter of 2023.
 
After comments from the FDA on the January 2023 pre-sub, we will begin pilot and pivotal trials for anxiety and insomnia which will take an estimated 9-18 months to complete patient recruitment and data collection. After data sets are complete and statisticians have reviewed and created a reporting matrix, members of the executive team will prepare final reports for submission to the FDA.
 
We have made a strategic decision to file a new PMA for the treatment of depression with the Gen-2 and Gen-3 devices that administer the new advanced Nexalin waveform at 15 milliamps. The Gen-1 device was previously cleared by the FDA at 4 milliamps and the re-classification does not prevent us from servicing previously sold or leased devices. Providers may continue to use these devices for treatment purposes. Servicing consists of warranty coverage, electrode sales, and patient cable replacement. This servicing is included in the monthly lease payment. We continue to derive revenue from devices which we sold or leased prior to the FDA’s December 2019 reclassification announcements. This revenue consists of monthly license fees and payment for the sale of electrodes to clinical providers of our technology. As we are in the process of evaluating our new Gen-2 15 milliamp waveform for our technology, a strategic decision was made to not pursue a PMA for the treatment of depression on our existing Gen-1 device. Strategy development has begun for a full PMA for the treatment of depression for our next generation Gen-2 and Gen-3 devices.
 
China
 
The NMPA is the governmental authority principally responsible for the supervision and administration of medical devices in the PRC. Medical devices in the PRC (including manufacturing, marketing, and sale) are subject to a mandatory filing/registration regime regulated by the NMPA. The exact filing pathways are mainly determined by the classification of such devices — like the United States, a three-class classification system, from Class I (lowest risk) to Class III (highest risk). Local testing and clinical trials are generally required for Class II and Class III devices. Some imported devices may need to be registered with a higher-level government authority than domestic devices.
 
As determined by the NMPA the three classes for devices are:
 
Class I — Medical devices for which routine administration can ensure safety for users and the effectiveness of the device.
 
Class II — Medical devices that can only be safe and effective with further control in addition to routine administration.
 
Class III — Medical devices that are implanted into the patient’s body, pose a threat to the patient’s health, or provide sustenance or life support.
 
All medical devices must be registered with the NMPA. An overseas device company must submit product samples to test with the NMPA. In addition, all included product information, packaging, and labels, and related material need to be translated into simplified Chinese. For a Class I device, simple product filing to NMPA are required. However, for Class II and Class III medical devices, the manufacturing company must meet all the requirements in the latest regulation, guidelines, and standards.
 
The NMPA approved the new Gen-2 15 milliamp device for the treatment of insomnia and depression. These treatment indications and clearances from the NMPA have allowed us to market and sell the Gen-2 device in China. Wider will be responsible for obtaining future NMPA registrations and approvals related to the marketing and sales of our devices in China.
 
Recent statements and regulatory actions by the Chinese government have targeted those companies whose operations involve cross-border data security or anti-monopoly concerns. Regarding data security, China has promulgated several important laws recently. Among them, on June 10, 2021, China promulgated the PRC Data Security Law (“DSL”), which became effective on September 1, 2021. The legislative intent for this law mainly includes regulating data processing activities, ensuring data security, promoting data development and utilization, protecting the data related legitimate rights and

interests of individuals and organizations, and safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests. Article 36 provides that any Chinese entity that provides the data to foreign judicial or law enforcement agencies (regardless of whether directly or through a foreign entity) without approval from the Chinese authority would likely be deemed to be in violation of DSL. In addition, pursuant to Article 2 of Measures for Cybersecurity Reviews, the procurement of any network product or service by an operator of critical information infrastructure that affects or may affect national security shall be subjected to a cybersecurity review under the Measures. Pursuant to Article 35 of Cybersecurity Law of the People’s Republic of China, where “critical information infrastructure operators” purchase network products and services, which may influence national security, the operators are required to be subjected to a cybersecurity review. We do not operate any critical information infrastructure. As a result, we do not believe that these new legal requirements in China are applicable to us, including sales made to date by Wider as a distributor. However, the exact scope of the term “critical information infrastructure operator” remains unclear, so there can be no assurance that the potential Joint Venture when formed will not be subjected to critical information infrastructure operator review in the future. Furthermore, in the event that the potential Joint Venture becomes an operator of critical information infrastructure in the future it may be subjected to the above-described regulation.
 
With regard to anti-monopoly concerns, Article 3 of Anti-Monopoly Law of the People’s Republic of China prohibits “monopolistic practices,” which include: a) the conclusion of monopoly agreements between operators; b) the abuse of dominant market position by operators; c) concentration of undertakings which has or may have the effect of eliminating or restricting market competition. Also, according to Article 19, the operator(s) will be assumed to have a dominant market position if it has following situation: a) an operator has 50% or higher market share in a relevant market; b) two operators have 66% or higher market share in a relevant market; c) three operators have 75% or higher market share in a relevant market. We believe that we have not conducted any monopolistic practices in China, and that recent statements and regulatory actions by the Chinese government do not impact our ability to conduct business, accept foreign investments, or list on a U.S. or other foreign stock exchange. However, there can be no assurance that regulators in China will not promulgate new laws and regulations or adopt new series of interpretations or regulatory actions which may require the potential Joint Venture to meet new requirements on the issues mentioned above.
 
Currently, these statements and regulatory actions of China authorities have had no impact on our daily business operation, including the sales and marketing efforts made to date of our Gen-2 devices in China through Wider. We do not believe that these statements and regulatory actions will have any impact on the potential Joint Venture when it is formed. Further, we are a United States’ company with no physical presence in China, and we do not believe that the formation of the potential Joint Venture in Hong Kong and any resultant exposure to China regulatory actions will adversely impact our ability to accept foreign investments or list our securities on a United States or other foreign exchange. However, since these statements and regulatory actions from China authorities are relatively recent, it is highly uncertain how soon legislative or administrative regulation making bodies will respond and what existing or new laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations will be modified or promulgated, if any, and the potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our daily business operation, the ability to accept foreign investments and list our securities on a United States or other foreign exchange. In the event any existing or new laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations are modified or promulgated, we and the potential Joint Venture will take any and all actions to remain in compliance with any such laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations thereof. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Doing Business in China.”
 
Following the formation of the potential Joint Venture, we intend to conduct a portion of our clinical research and implement a business distribution plan for our devices in China and elsewhere through the potential Joint Venture, which we believe confers clinical, commercial, and regulatory advantages, but may subject us to significant regulatory, liquidity, and enforcement risks. Although we do not intend to have any physical presence in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, the potential Joint Venture agreements between us and Wider contemplate that the potential Joint Venture will have a physical presence for the potential Joint Venture in Hong Kong. Wider, as a China formed entity with its physical presence in China may be subject to regulatory actions and prohibitions from China regulatory entities and required to obtain certain approvals.
 
The PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike the common law system, prior court decisions under the civil law system may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. Uncertainties in the interpretation and enforcement of Chinese laws and regulations could limit the legal protections available to us.

Market and Industry Background
 
General
 
Historically, pharmaceutical solutions have been the first line of treatment for those who suffer from anxiety, insomnia, depression, and other mental health disorders. Beginning in 1950, for patients that were not responding to medication, ECT, also called “shock therapy,” became available. Over time, researchers began to look at alternative ways to inject electricity into the human brain. One such method was via implantable neurostimulators that required invasive surgery procedures associated with high cost and high risk. Implantable devices became the potential solution for those who would not take or could no longer take pharmaceuticals. The interest in electricity continued with the creation of small handheld devices powered by a direct current (DC) battery that the consumer could buy without any medical supervision. Clinical versions of DC stimulators, known as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), were developed by researchers; many of these devices are still in research settings without industry support.
 
In 1992, a new neurostimulation technique emerged called trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). This technique evolved into repetitive trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which utilized repetitive magnetic pulse energy to stimulate the brain of patients struggling with depression. The American pharmaceutical industry embraced and funded this technology. The FDA cleared rTMS only for patients who had failed to respond to anti-depressants. Side effects, high cost and moderate efficacy continue to burden this technology sector.
 
Both insurance companies and healthcare providers are looking for alternative ways to decrease costs while still providing safe and effective treatments.
 
We believe that our new marketing and growth strategy in combination with our advanced 15 milliamp waveform, technological upgrades and the development of a modern headset monitored with our IT management platform, will position us for the opportunity to disrupt the traditional mental health treatment model. Our mission is to remove the stigma of expensive psychotherapy or pharmaceuticals with the attendant side effects and dependency issues and replace it with clinically proven and cost-effective technology that is easily accessible in the privacy of the patient’s home and monitored by licensed healthcare providers.
 
Anxiety Market
 
Anxiety disorders are considered the most prevalent of psychiatric disorders. Anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and phobias.
Insomnia Market
 
Insomnia is a common sleep disorder considered to be responsible for at least $63 billion in direct and indirect healthcare costs each year, according to the Harvard American Insomnia Study. A frightening number of insomnia cases are undiagnosed and untreated, even as the condition becomes a mounting financial burden on America’s employers and the healthcare system. Data surrounding sleep disorders demonstrate that insomnia is a growing problem that shows no signs of slowing down. Current market conditions present an opportunity to introduce a technology that provides a safe, effective and drug-free alternative for those suffering from insomnia. We believe we have the ability to decrease the number of potentially addictive insomnia prescriptions needed by patients and offer physicians a non-pharmaceutical option to provide their patients. Additionally, we are developing a solution for home-based treatment for chronic insomnia and to improve sleep hygiene for its user.
Depression Market
 
Depression continues to be the leading cause of medical disability around the world. Poor efficacy, risk and adverse side effects of current anti-depressants are driving the preference for non-pharmacological therapies, which will limit growth for the pharmaceutical sector of the depression treatment market. This limitation will enhance the research and development of novel therapies that treat depression safely and effectively without adverse side effects. Historically, according to the CDC, only one-third of people with severe depression have taken anti-depressants.

Any decline in the depression medication market should indirectly accelerate the growth of the neurostimulator market. Management believes that, based on the market data and current trends, the depression market — like the anxiety and insomnia market — creates enormous potential for our products.
 
Prior to December 2019, our Gen-1 device was considered a Class III device. Treatment of depression in the United States is limited to Class III devices only. Prior to 2019, our existing Gen-1 4 milliamp medical device had been used to successfully treat depression in the U.S. The Gen-2 15 milliamp version of our device when introduced into the United States will be subject to approximately eighteen months of clinical study before our PMA application for depression will be accepted. Assuming we will be able to obtain successful classification from the FDA, we expect to market our device in the United States as a treatment for depression.
 
Substance Use Disorders (Opioid Addiction) Market
 
According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA,) substance use, and substance use disorders cost the United States more than $740 billion a year in healthcare, crime and lost productivity costs; but dollars barely capture the devastating human cost of addiction to individuals, families and communities. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 19.7 million adults in the United States suffered from a substance use disorder in 2017.
 
The current success rate of the best drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities is minimal. We believe that this represents a significant market opportunity for our company. The disease of addiction is brain-based in its nature. Currently brain-based treatments for the disease are only available to patients who can afford long-term expensive boutique treatment centers. We intend to demonstrate that a brain-based approach to addiction treatment will enhance a patient’s success at long-term recovery. Our hypothesis is that the current pilot study design at the University California San Diego (see below) will provide a source of validation for this treatment modality in addiction treatment.
 
Chronic Pain Market
 
Originally, our waveform was designed as an electro-analgesic for pain. This refers to the ability to electrically interrupt the pain signalling process in the brain. By interrupting the pain signalling process in the brain, our products can reduce symptoms and discomfort associated with chronic pain. By reducing the symptoms and discomfort associated with chronic pain, physicians can reduce medications and avoid dependency issues related to opiate-based medications.
 
According to Research and Markets, the global chronic pain treatment market is predicted to progress at a CAGR of 6.5% from 2020 to 2030 and generate revenue of $151.7 billion in 2030.
 
Currently, we own an electrostimulation patent for a device that will apply electrodes to the brain, spine, and the place of injury. The placement of these electrodes in conjunction with our various waveforms creates an opportunity for us to treat chronic pain without medication. The Nexalin executive team is preparing strategies to develop a prototype of our existing patented design and introduce it into clinical trials for the treatment of chronic pain. In previous pilot studies, our existing Gen-1 product reduced pain in patients suffering from injuries originating in industrial accidents. However, we plan to use the new advanced waveform emitted at 15 milliamps into the new prototype pain device for new clinical trials for the treatment of chronic pain.
 
Alzheimer’s Disease and Dementia Market
 
Alzheimer’s disease is a degenerative brain disease and the most common form of dementia. Dementia is not a specific disease, but rather an overall term that describes a group of symptoms. According to the WHO, there are around 50 million people living with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias worldwide.
 
According to Reports and Data, the global Alzheimer’s therapeutics market is projected to reach $13.57 billion by 2027 from $7.42 billion in 2019 with a substantial compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.2% through the forecast period.
 
We believe our products could be leveraged to extend the quality of life for millions of people who are diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.

Marketing and Sales Efforts
 
We believe that our marketing and sales plan provides a long-term scalable business model. Our team is preparing the foundation and marketing assets necessary to launch the new virtual clinic model that will complement the traditional clinic model. Our sales model is to place more than 1,000 Gen-2 and Gen-3 devices on the global stage. The momentum and branding strategies of Nexalin providers will be leveraged to enhance the launch of a global sales plan. The Gen-2 device at 15 milliamps supported by the Gen-3 outpatient headset and our virtual digital management platform is intended to disrupt the current mental healthcare model. The Gen-2 and Gen-3 device at 15 milliamps will offer patients a cost effective and efficient treatment model for day-to-day mental health challenges. We believe those devices, with their advanced waveform, can treat existing mental health disorders associated with anxiety and insomnia. Additionally, new strategies are in research and development for FDA treatment indications of depression, substance use disorder, opioid addiction, alcoholism and chronic pain. Additional research and treatment efficacy are being investigated for the Alzheimer’s community for patient care and management.
 
Our plan is designed to triangulate and stimulate the physician, consumer, and manufacturer relationship. Trends in healthcare indicate consumers are involved in treatment decisions that concern their mental health. Because of the advancement in healthcare technologies, home-based care with medical supervision provides patients with a cost-effective and efficient treatment option. Home-based care also avoids the stigma associated with treatment for mental health disorders. In our current sales plan, we intend to launch with a physician provider in each state. These physicians will lead the Nexalin campaign in each state as that states primary provider. These preferred state providers will begin with the virtual clinic. Our marketing team will drive consumers with quality-of-life struggles related to mental health issues into the virtual clinic and then to the provider in the consumer’s state of residence. These initial state physicians providing mental health services in the virtual clinic, will also have ability to offer treatment in their clinic. The in-clinic model will use the Gen-2 clinical device while the virtual clinic will use the Gen-3 headset. This initial launch plan with state providers will develop and support multiple marketing verticals to drive the Nexalin brand and treatment as an alternative to medications and psychotherapy. We will leverage this physician / patient community to establish a national network of physicians that offer mental health evaluations and the Nexalin treatment in either a clinical setting or in the privacy of the patient home with medical supervision through the future Nexalin app.
 
Most, if not all, patients treated in the Nexalin virtual clinic would be part of a digital community that supports brand awareness and the sharing of anonymous treatment outcomes in a social media setting. The Patient Activation Program will include a robust data gathering system on providers and patients (opt-in) that enhances our marketing strategies.
 
Insurance Reimbursement for Our Products
 
In January 2020, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in conjunction with the Durable Medical Equipment for Medicare Administrative Contractors issued a code for Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulators (CES). CMS issues codes that are used by medical practitioners to obtain Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance reimbursement. The issuance of this code is the first time that a reimbursement code from CMS has been designated specifically for CES. The code does not guarantee reimbursement and is considered at this time, experimental. The Nexalin consulting team plans to continue preparing clinical data and durability data to pursue long term clinical reimbursement.
 
Reimbursement strategies for this type of technology are complex and vary from one diagnosis to another. We utilize an RFID system that will track doses delivered. This will simplify comparing our devices to pharmaceutical interventions. Beginning in 2023, a complete reimbursement assessment is being conducted and evaluated to develop a strategy to acquire reimbursement. We will employ a two-prong approach for eventual reimbursement. The first prong will evaluate the clinic-based product offered by physicians. The second prong will focus on tracking usage and response from the outpatient headset model that is tracked through the virtual platform. Frequently therapies that are used in the home are not classified as durable medical equipment and will fall into a reimbursement gap without coverage. We intend to work to successfully achieve a Level 2 code under the healthcare common procedure coding system. We will work to seek reimbursement for conditions in sequence with the home based and the clinic-based unit that will maximize value of treatment from a financial standpoint as well as monitoring the response by the patient community.

Research
 
Research is the fundamental core of any pharmaceutical or medical device company. Although small trials, with limited patients, can show promise for a treatment, they are generally not acceptable to the FDA for product approval. To commercialize a product for widespread use, multiple large-scale trials are required to demonstrate both efficacy and safety. In the past two decades, the cost of conducting such trials has more than doubled, with many small start-up companies unable to raise the necessary capital to complete these vital projects. The increase in cost reflects several variables which are required for successful clinical trial completion.
 
The various costs can include patient recruitment and retention expenses, physician, and nurse expenses, as well as the expenses of other healthcare providers. Various regulations, each more complex than the next, also have added significant cost to the process. Data collection, as well as data analysis, is also a significant portion of the study cost. Additionally, almost all studies are conducted through either a large university, with its underlying overhead for administrative costs and institutional review board approval, or through a contract research organization, which also adds significant overhead costs in addition to the hard cost of the study itself. Latest estimates for the cost per patient for an average trial is approximately $41,000.
 
In 2019, we began a research partnership with the University California San Diego (UCSD). Prior to the pandemic, two pilot clinical studies were undertaken with UCSD, however, these trials were paused due to the shutdown of college campuses in California. In the summer of 2022, new contract negotiations began to explore strategies for PTSD and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Timelines, contracts, study design and research strategies are in progress and are waiting for new pilot data sets.
 
Currently, a pilot trial at UCSD is focused on veterans suffering from mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and is funded by the United States Department of Defense. One of the primary symptoms associated with mTBI is PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). The primary endpoint associated with this study is the assessment and reduction of post-concussion symptoms associated with PTSD. A secondary endpoint for the study will be improvement in Magnetoencephalography (MEG) slow-wave abnormalities.
 
In addition to UCSD, we are developing strategies to initiate further trials to address new FDA guidelines. These new strategies and pivotal trials will support new 510(k)s for anxiety and insomnia at 15 milliamps. These trials are in addition to the special control trials required by the FDA. Final trial designs are due to be executed after recommendations are reviewed from the FDA pre-sub meetings projected to take place in Q2 2023. Other areas of research that will be designed and funded relate to the treatment of substance use disorders, Alzheimer’s disease, and dementia.
 
Additional research in China is being performed with the goal of publishing the findings in a peer reviewed journal. All research will be controlled by our team, with all trial designs requiring written final approval by our Chief Medical Officer. Clinical updates will be required every 30-days. Frequent in-person WeChat meetings will also be performed to ensure the integrity of the research efforts.
 
In addition to clinical trial work in China and current studies in the United States required by the FDA, an additional study is planned with the 15 milliamp Gen-2 and Gen-3 devices to evaluate a large cohort of patients with depression. This trial will include a double-blind study design with active and sham groups. Patient selection screening will evaluate 200-250 subjects to acquire the number of patients needed for a successful trial. Each patient, upon enrollment, will be evaluated extensively prior to initiation of therapy. Patients will be treated a minimum of 20 separate times, with pre- and post-test screening. Moreover, upon completion of therapy, post-test examination will be performed not only immediately thereafter but also over the course of one to three months to establish not only efficacy but durability of the treatment. The results of this study will provide the basis of the PMA with the FDA for the treatment of Depression.

At the start of 2021, an Alzheimer’s specific clinical trial was underway in China: “Transcranial alternating current stimulation for patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease.” Extensive cognitive pre- and post-evaluations are being performed at the beginning and conclusion of the study, with less rigorous evaluations before and after each therapy session. Because of issues related to Covid-19 in China, this trial was paused. Additionally, results of this trial will dictate additional testing strategies to determine specific treatment protocols for complex Alzheimer’s and dementia patients.
 
A final area of study includes the evaluation of chemical changes within the brain following transcranial stimulation. Chemicals, which are naturally formed in the brain, control many of our moods and thoughts, modulating feelings of pain, depression and generalized mood. These substances also drive cravings in substance use disorders. One of the specific areas of research is to validate changes of serotonin levels in the brain. Serotonin is a “feel good” chemical which has also been associated with learning. Other chemicals, such as dopamine, act in a reward center mechanism. Additionally, certain other neurons require specific chemicals to either fire or be inhibited from firing. These areas can be explored with specific radioactive markers in the brain for evaluation with PET MRI scans.
 
Virtual Clinic Digital Management Platform
 
We expect to capitalize on the post pandemic digital health model. Our team began researching IT digital development firms at the beginning of the pandemic. We have now completed our research and bidding process and have begun contract negotiations with a leading IT design team to begin work on an advanced, proprietary IT management platform that will eventually manage all aspects of the Nexalin virtual clinic model. The vision is to implement a virtual clinic model that will enable providers and clinics to integrate remote outpatients into an overall treatment process. Our IT platform goes well beyond telehealth and is designed to support all aspects of the treatment model in conjunction with various data sets to support marketing, data collection and patient monitoring. Our digital management platform will manage the entire clinical and outpatient headset business model. The proprietary IT platform will manage all aspects of a new virtual health center related to treatment for mental health. As the development of the new generations of our devices and the outpatient headset are developed, the digital platform will eventually manage and triangulate the relationship between the medical professional, the patient, and the manufacturer. The digital platform will handle logistics, data collection and user experience data for clinical evaluation. Additionally, there will be an app that the patients will install on their phones that will communicate with the outpatient headset. The app will upload user information that is HIPAA compliant to the IT management platform. Modules will be designed and implemented in the platform to collect biometric data. The biometric data will be utilized to evaluate patient response. A symptom exam for additional clinical validation will also be offered in the app. All data and user information will be stored in a secure, HIPAA compliant cloud computing center and access to the information will be managed through a secure and compliant dashboard management system. The medical professional will have access to all data to monitor outpatient experience, client response and general health and wellness information.
 
We will leverage our IT investment to create a lead management system for mental health physicians connecting prospective patients with providers. The medical professional will be able to engage in a telehealth virtual appointment with prospective patients to complete an evaluation and assess whether the patient is a candidate for the outpatient headset program. After the professional approves the device for the patient, we will automatically prepare shipment of the device directly to the outpatient consumer from the manufacturer. We will have an internal department to monitor shipment, and to answer questions through a help desk on how to set up and use the device. The medical professional can be reimbursed for the virtual appointment via the outpatient’s insurance for telehealth care which is becoming part of the new normal in the post-pandemic, digital-health world.
 
Additional design and implementation of modules related to social media marketing, bio-metric data collection and user experience will eventually complete the design of the IT management platform.
 
Manufacturing
 
In December 2021, we entered into a quality assurance agreement with Apical Instruments, an FDA-registered manufacturer, to ensure quality assurance of our products. We currently have enough design and manufacturing support to meet all projected company design and sales goals. Our regulatory team works closely with the Apical quality team to ensure all current compliance and testing standards are adhered to. All distribution channels will rely on a collaboration between the Apical and Nexalin teams.

Intellectual Property
 
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to: obtain and maintain proprietary or intellectual property protection for our products, our core technologies and other know-how; operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others; and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary or intellectual property rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary and intellectual property position by, among other methods, filing United States and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on the skills, knowledge, and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how that is not patentable, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. As part of our hiring practices and as described in out Code of Ethics which is binding on all employees, our employees, consultants, and advisors are prohibited from disclosing confidential information and are required to assign to us the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.
 
We file patent applications directed to our key products to establish intellectual property positions. These patent applications are intended to protect these products as well as their uses in the treatment of diseases. We are the owner and inventor of two existing patent and five pending patents related to the electro-stimulation techniques related to our products and services. Our current patents cover a therapeutic electro-stimulation apparatus (the medical device) and the software used to create and administer the stimulation to the patient. We expect to file additional provisional and non-provisional patent applications and copyright protection pertaining to future Generation technology, proprietary software, and trademarks. The patent claims associated with the non-provisional patent applications will be defined and prepared in the filings. The intention is to build an intellectual property portfolio asset. Future research and development projects related to advancements in neurostimulation and neuromodulation technology will be identified and investigated for future patent filings.
 
Our trademark portfolio currently consists of registered trademark rights for the mark, NEXALIN TECHNOLOGY, in the United States. In connection with the ongoing development and advancement of our products and services in the United States and various international jurisdictions, we routinely seek to create protection for our marks and enhance their value by pursuing trademarks and service marks where available and when appropriate. In addition to patents and trademark protection, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 
Competition
 
We plan to be the leader in brain-based health. We compete with traditional pharmaceutical therapies. All of these have side effects, such as drug dependency as well as adverse health risks.
 
We also compete with several neurostimulators at the high and low end of the market as well as implanted devices. All have either a high-risk profile or uncomfortable side effects with moderate efficacy. Our products were designed as a cost-effective option to all current reimbursed treatments available to the patient.
 
We believe that existing neurostimulation products are either high risk, high cost and difficult to administer. In addition, they are invasive, frequently requiring surgery and multiple visits to a physician. Since many of the conditions requiring ongoing treatments, the difficulty and cost of administering them make them of limited utility for broad application.
 
Corporate Information; Recent Initial Public Offering; Employees
 
We were originally formed as a Nevada corporation on October 19, 2010 as Nexalin Technology, Inc. On December 1, 2021, we completed the corporate reorganization described under the sub-section titled “Corporate Reorganization,” pursuant to which Nexalin Nevada merged with and into a newly incorporated Delaware company of the same name, Nexalin and, as a result, Nexalin succeeded Nexalin Nevada and our existing shareholders exchanged each of their shares in Nexalin Nevada for one twentieth (1/20th) of a common share of the newly formed Delaware corporation. Nexalin had nominal assets and liabilities and did not conduct any operations prior to the reorganization other than its incorporation.

We completed the closing of our initial public offering on September 16, 2022. The initial public offering consisted of 2,315,000 units consisting of 2,315,000 shares of its Common Stock and 2,315,000 accompanying warrants to purchase up to 2,315,000 shares of common stock. Each share of common stock was sold together with one warrant, each to purchase one share of common stock with an exercise price of $4.15 per share at a combined offering price of $4.15, for gross proceeds of $9,607,250, before deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses. In addition, Nexalin granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 347,250 shares of common stock and/or warrants to purchase up to 347,250 shares of common stock to cover over-allotments at the initial public offering price, less the underwriting discount. The underwriters exercised their option to purchase 347,250 warrants for net proceeds of $3,473.
 
A registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-261989) was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which became effective on September 15, 2022. A final prospectus relating to the offering was filed with the SEC and is available on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov.
 
Our shares and warrants began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market tier of the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) on September 16, 2022, under the symbols “NXL” and “NXLIW”, respectively.
 
Properties
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 1776 Yorktown, Suite 550, Houston, Texas 77056. Our phone number is (832) 260-0222. Our website address is www.nexalin.com. We do not incorporate the information on or accessible through our website into this Report on Form 10-K. We have included our website address in this Annual Report on Form 10-K solely as an inactive textual reference.
Human Capital Resources
 
We currently have 6 full time employees and approximately 7 consultants at different times working on various projects. These consultants, and our legal and financial advisors assist us in various areas related to regulatory, engineering, research and development, sales and marketing, legal, financial and other miscellaneous tasks necessary to run our business on day-to-day basis and to facilitate the development of new products.
 
None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. We have historically utilized contractors to perform many of our services. Through this process, we believe that we have attracted highly qualified professionals.
 
Compensation and Benefits
 
We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. Medical device companies both large and small compete for a limited number of qualified applicants to fill specialized positions. To attract qualified applicants as we attempt to scale our business, we will need to offer a total rewards package consisting of base salary and cash target bonus, a comprehensive benefit package and equity compensation to select employees. Bonus opportunity and equity compensation is expected to increase as a percentage of total compensation based on level of responsibility, and actual bonus pay-out would be based on performance.
Health, Wellness and Safety
 
We believe that the safety and health of our employees and their families is essential to our business. Our culture is driven by a desire to do what is right, and we strive to support the well-being of our employees. We prioritize the safety and well-being of our employees even after they have faced both mental and physical challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company and a Smaller Reporting Company
 
We qualify as an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Start-ups Act of 2012, as amended, or the JOBS Act. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from some of the reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include:

● | being permitted to present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations disclosures; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | not being required to comply with any requirements that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We may take advantage of these exemptions until the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO which was completed on September 16, 2022. However, if any of the following events occur prior to the end of such five-year period, (i) our annual gross revenue exceeds $1.07 billion, (ii) we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period or (iii) we become a “large accelerated filer,” (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), we will cease to be an emerging growth company prior to the end of such five-year period. We will be deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” at such time that we (a) have an aggregate worldwide market value of common equity securities held by non-affiliates of $700 million or more as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, (b) have been required to file annual and quarterly reports under the Exchange Act, for a period of at least twelve months and (c) have filed at least one annual report pursuant to the Exchange Act. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a “smaller reporting company,” which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements.
 
The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period.
 
We are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined in the Exchange Act. We may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies until the fiscal year following the determination that our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is more than $250 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenues are less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter.
