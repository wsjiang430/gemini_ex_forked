Item 1. Business
Background
 
Business Overview
 
Sigyn Therapeutics, Inc. (“Sigyn”, the “Company”, “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a development-stage company focused on creating therapeutic solutions that address unmet needs in global health. Our corporate address is 2468 Historic Decatur Road, Suite 140, San Diego, California, 92106.
 
Sigyn Therapy™, our lead product candidate, is a broad-spectrum blood purification technology designed to treat pathogen-associated inflammatory disorders that are not addressed with approved drug therapies. Candidate treatment indications include endotoxemia and inflammation in end-stage renal disease (dialysis) patients, sepsis (a leading cause of hospital deaths), community acquired pneumonia (a leading cause of death among infectious diseases), and emerging pandemic threats.
 
Our development pipeline includes a cancer treatment system comprised of ChemoPrep™ to enhance the tumor site delivery of chemotherapy, and ChemoPure™ to reduce treatment toxicity and inhibit the spread of cancer metastasis.
 
Merger Transaction
 
On October 19, 2020, Sigyn Therapeutics, Inc, a Delaware corporation (the “Registrant”) formerly known as Reign Resources Corporation, completed a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Sigyn Therapeutics, Inc., a private entity incorporated in the State of Delaware on October 19, 2019.
 
In the Share Exchange Agreement, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of privately held Sigyn Therapeutics common stock in exchange for 75% of the fully paid and nonassessable shares of our common stock outstanding (the “Acquisition”). In conjunction with the transaction, we changed our name from Reign Resources Corporation to Sigyn Therapeutics, Inc. pursuant to an amendment to our articles of incorporation that was filed with the State of Delaware. Subsequently, our trading symbol was changed to SIGY. The Acquisition was treated by the Company as a reverse merger in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). For accounting purposes, Sigyn is considered to have acquired Reign Resources Corporation as the accounting acquirer because: (i) Sigyn stockholders own 75% of the combined company, on an as-converted basis, immediately following the Closing Date, (ii) Sigyn directors hold a majority of board seats in the combined company and (iii) Sigyn management held all key positions in the management of the combined company. Accordingly, Sigyn’s historical results of operations will replace Reign Resources Corporation’s historical results of operations for all periods prior to the Acquisition and, for all periods following the Acquisition, the results of operations of the combined company will be included in the Company’s financial statements. The Acquisition was treated as a “tax-free exchange” under Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and resulted in the private Sigyn Therapeutics corporate entity (established on October 29, 2019) to become a wholly owned subsidiary of Reign Resources Corporation. Among the conditions for closing the acquisition, the Reign Resources Corporation extinguished all previously reported liabilities, its preferred class of shares, and all stock purchase options. As a result, the reported liabilities totalling $3,429,516 were converted into a total of 7,907,351 common shares. Additionally, assets held on the books of Reign Resources Corporation, such as Gem inventory, was kept in the Company and therefore recorded as assets on the Share Exchange date. Upon the closing of the Acquisition, we appointed James A. Joyce and Craig P. Roberts to serve as members of our Board of Directors.
 
As of March 31, 2023, we had a total 42,713,325 shares issued and outstanding, of which 17,073,325 shares are held by non-affiliate shareholders.

Post-Merger Developments
 
Since the consummation of the Acquisition on October 19, 2020, we have advanced Sigyn Therapy from conceptual design through completion of in vitro studies that have quantified the reduction of relevant therapeutic targets from human blood plasma with small-scale versions of Sigyn Therapy. These include endotoxin (gram-negative bacterial toxin); peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acid (gram-positive bacterial toxins); viral pathogens (including SARS-CoV-2); hepatic toxins (ammonia, bile acid, and bilirubin); and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1b), and interleukin 6 (IL-6), which are pro-inflammatory cytokines whose dysregulated production (the cytokine storm) precipitate sepsis and play a prominent role in each of our therapeutic opportunities.
 
Subsequent to these studies, we disclosed the completion of in vivo animal studies. In these studies, Sigyn Therapy was administered via standard dialysis machines utilizing conventional blood-tubing sets, for periods of up to six hours in eight (8) porcine (pig) subjects, each weighing approximately 40-45 kilograms. The studies were comprised of a pilot phase (two subjects), which evaluated the feasibility of the study protocol in the first-in-mammal use of Sigyn Therapy; and an expansion phase (six subjects) to further assess treatment feasibility and refine pre-treatment set-up and operating procedures. There were no serious adverse events reported in any of the treated animal subjects. Of the eight treatments, seven were administered for the entire six-hour treatment period. One treatment was halted early due to the observation of a clot in the device, which was believed to be the result of a procedural deviation in the pre-treatment set-up. Important criteria for treatment feasibility – including hemodynamic parameters, serum chemistries and hematologic measurements – were stable across all subjects.
 
The studies were conducted by a clinical team at Innovative BioTherapies, Inc. (“IBT”), under a contract with the University of Michigan to utilize animal care, associated institutional review oversight, as well as surgical suite facilities located within the North Campus Research Complex. The treatment protocol of the study was reviewed and approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
 
The animal studies were conducted to correspond with FDA’s best practice guidance. The number of animals enrolled in our study and the amount of data collected was based on the ethical and least burdensome principles that underly the FDA goal of using the minimum number of animals necessary to generate valid scientific data to demonstrate reasonable feasibility and performance of a medical device prior to human study consideration. A porcine animal model is a generally accepted model for the study of extracorporeal blood purification devices intended to treat infectious disease and inflammatory disorders. Regardless of these factors, FDA may require that we conduct additional animal studies.
 
The data resulting from our in vivo and in vitro studies is being incorporated into an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) that we are drafting for submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to support the potential initiation of a human feasibility study in End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients with endotoxemia and elevated inflammatory cytokine production. As per the study protocol, Sigyn Therapy is to be administered in combination with the regularly scheduled dialysis treatments of enrolled subjects. The primary study objective will be to evaluate the safety of Sigyn Therapy in health compromised ESRD patients. A secondary objective will be to quantify changes in circulating levels of endotoxin, tumour necrosis factor-αlpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) before and after each Sigyn Therapy administration. Endotoxin and excess TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 production are commonly associated with each of our candidate treatment indications, including sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia.
 
Based on our previous experience in developing extracorporeal blood purification therapies, we believe that we have collected sufficient data to support first-in-human studies of Sigyn Therapy. In this regard, we plan to submit an IDE application to FDA related to the potential initiation of a human feasibility study during the 2023 calendar year. However, there is no assurance that FDA will approve the initiation of our feasibility study. Additionally, while we believe the data from our in vivo and in vitro studies provides support for our IDE submission, FDA may request that we conduct additional animal or pre-clinical studies prior to approving our IDE. Among our previous experiences in developing extracorporeal blood purification therapies, our CEO oversaw the development of the Aethlon Hemopurifier, a first-in-industry device that received an FDA “Breakthrough Device” designation for the treatment of life-threatening viruses and was awarded a second FDA “Breakthrough Device” designation related to the treatment of cancer.

Sigyn Therapy Mechanism of Action
 
We designed Sigyn Therapy to be a candidate to treat pathogen-associated inflammatory conditions that are life-threatening. To date, pre-clinical in vitro studies have quantified the reduction of viral pathogens, bacterial toxins, and inflammatory mediators from human blood plasma with small-scale versions of Sigyn Therapy. Such capabilities establish Sigyn Therapy as a candidate to treat pathogen-associated conditions that precipitate Sepsis, Community Acquired Pneumonia, Emerging Bioterror and Pandemic threats, and End-Stage Renal Disease patients with endotoxemia and elevated inflammatory cytokine production.
 
To support widespread implementation, Sigyn Therapy is a single-use disposable device that is deployable on the global infrastructure of hemodialysis and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) machines already located in hospitals and clinics. To reduce the risk of blood clotting and hemolysis, the anticoagulant heparin is administered, which is the standard-of-care drug administered in dialysis and CRRT therapies. During animal studies conducted at the University of Michigan, Sigyn Therapy was deployed for use on a hemodialysis machine manufactured by Fresenius Medical Care, the global leader in the dialysis industry.
 
Incorporated within Sigyn Therapy is a “cocktail” of adsorbent components formulated to optimize the broad-spectrum reduction of therapeutic targets from the bloodstream. In the medical field, the term “cocktail” is a reference to the simultaneous administration of multiple drugs (a drug cocktail) with differing mechanisms of actions. While drug cocktails are emerging as potential mechanisms to treat cancer, they are life-saving countermeasures to treat HIV and Hepatitis-C viral infections. However, dosing of multi-drug agent cocktails is limited by toxicity and adverse events that can result from deleterious drug interactions.
 
Sigyn Therapy is not constrained by such limitations as active adsorbent components are maintained within Sigyn Therapy and not introduced into the body. As a result, we are able to incorporate a substantial quantity of adsorbent components to capture therapeutic targets outside of the body as they circulate through Sigyn Therapy. Each adsorbent component has differing capture characteristics that contribute to optimizing the potential of Sigyn Therapy to reduce the presence of pathogenic and inflammatory targets that precipitate the cytokine storm that underlies sepsis and other life-threatening inflammatory disorders.
 
The adsorbent components incorporated within Sigyn Therapy provide more than 200,000 square meters (~50 acres) of surface area on which to adsorb and remove circulating viruses, bacterial toxins, and inflammatory mediators. Beyond a potential capacity to reduce therapeutic targets from human blood plasma, we believe that Sigyn Therapy offers an efficient treatment methodology. Based on targeted blood flow rates of 350ml/min, a patient’s entire bloodstream can pass through Sigyn Therapy more than fifteen times during a single four-hour treatment period.
 
From a technical perspective, Sigyn Therapy is a 325mm long polycarbonate column that internally contains polyethersulphone hollow fibers that have porous walls with a median pore size of ~200 nanometers (nm). As blood flows into Sigyn Therapy, plasma and therapeutic targets below 200nm travel through the porous walls as a result of blood-side pressure. As the hollow fiber bundle within Sigyn Therapy creates a resistance to the flow of blood, a pressure drop is created along the length of the device such that the blood-side pressure is higher at the blood inlet and lower at the blood outlet. This allows for plasma and therapeutic targets to flow away from the blood and into the extra-lumen space (inside the polycarbonate shell, yet outside the hollow-fiber bundle) to interact with Sigyn Therapy’s adsorbent components in a low shear force environment. In the distal third of the fiber bundle, the pressure gradient is reversed, which allows for plasma to flow back through the fiber walls to be reconvened into the bloodstream without the presence of therapeutic targets that were captured or bound by adsorbent components housed in the extra-lumen space of Sigyn Therapy.
 
Overview of Candidate Treatment Indications
 
Based on data resulting from in vitro blood purification studies, our candidate treatment indications include, but are not limited to; pathogen-associated inflammatory conditions that precipitate Sepsis (leading cause of hospital deaths worldwide), Community Acquired Pneumonia (a leading cause of death among infectious diseases), Emerging Bioterror and Pandemic threats, and endotoxemia and inflammation in End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients. However, there is no assurance that human feasibility and pivotal studies will demonstrate Sigyn Therapy to be a safe and efficacious treatment for any treatment indications.

End-Stage Renal Disease, Endotoxemia and Inflammation
 
According to the United States Renal Data System (USRDS), more than 550,000 individuals suffer from end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which results in approximately 85 million kidney dialysis treatments being administered in the United States each year. Persistent inflammation is a hallmark feature of ESRD as reflected by the excess production of inflammatory cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which contribute to increased all-cause mortality. ESRD inflammation also induces intestinal permeability, which allows endotoxin (gram-negative bacterial toxin) to translocate from the gut and into the bloodstream. Beyond fuelling further inflammation, endotoxin is potent activator of sepsis, which can lead to multiple organ failure and ultimately death.
 
Sigyn Therapy establishes a candidate strategy to improve the health and quality-of-life of ESRD patients. Beyond its potential to reduce endotoxin, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 from human blood plasma, Sigyn Therapy can be administered in series with regularly scheduled dialysis therapy.
 
We are currently preparing an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) for submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) related to a human feasibility study of Sigyn Therapy in ESRD patients with endotoxemia and elevated inflammatory cytokine production. As per the study protocol, Sigyn Therapy will be administered in combination with the regularly scheduled dialysis treatments of enrolled subjects. The primary study objective will be to evaluate the safety of Sigyn Therapy in health compromised ESRD patients. A secondary objective is to quantify changes in circulating levels of endotoxin, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) before and after each Sigyn Therapy administration. Endotoxin and excess TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 production are commonly associated with each of our candidate treatment indications, including sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia.
 
Sepsis
 
Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. In January of 2020, a report entitled; “Global, Regional, and National Sepsis Incidence and Mortality, 1990-2017: Analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study,” was published in the Journal Lancet. The publication reported 48.9 million cases of sepsis and 11 million deaths in 2017. In that same year, an estimated 20.3 million sepsis cases and 2.9 million deaths were among children younger than 5-years old. The report included a reference that sepsis kills more people around the world than all forms of cancer combined. In the United States, sepsis was reported to be the most common cause of hospital deaths with an annual financial burden that exceeds $24 billion.
 
To date, more than 100 human studies have been conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of candidate drugs to treat sepsis. With one brief exception (Xigris, Eli Lilly), none of these studies resulted in a market cleared therapy. As sepsis remains beyond the reach of single-target drugs, there is an emerging interest in multi-mechanism therapies that can target both inflammatory and pathogen associated targets. Sigyn Therapy addresses a broad-spectrum of pathogen sources and the resulting dysregulated cytokine production (the cytokine storm) that is the hallmark of sepsis. Additionally, we believe that inflammatory cytokine cargos transported by CytoVesicles may represent a novel, yet important therapeutic target.
 
Community Acquired Pneumonia
 
Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) represents a significant opportunity for Sigyn Therapy to reduce the occurrence of sepsis. CAP is a leading cause of death among infectious diseases, the leading cause of death in children under five years of age, and a catalyst for approximately 50% of sepsis and septic shock cases.
 
In the United States, more than 1.5 million individuals are hospitalized with CAP each year, resulting in an annual financial burden that exceeds $10 billion.

-

 

Statistically, a therapeutic strategy that reduced the incidence of CAP related sepsis and septic shock would save thousands of lives each year. In a study of 4,222 patients, the all-cause mortality for adult patients with CAP was reported to be 6.5% during hospitalization. However, the mortality of patients with CAP related sepsis and septic shock rose to 51% during hospitalization.
 
CAP is further complicated by the fact that the pathogen sources of CAP are identified in only 38% of patients, based on a study of 2,259 subjects whose pneumonia diagnosis was confirmed by chest x-ray. Of the source pathogens identified in the study, ninety seven percent (97%) were either viral or bacterial in origin.
 
To reduce the occurrence of CAP related sepsis and septic shock, Sigyn Therapy offers a broad-spectrum mechanism to reduce the circulating presence of viral pathogens and bacterial toxins before and if they are identified as the CAP pathogen source. Additionally, Sigyn Therapy may help to control the excess production of inflammatory cytokines (the cytokine storm) that precipitate sepsis and septic shock.
 
Emerging Pandemic Threats
 
Covid-19 affirmed the use of extracorporeal blood purification as a first-line countermeasures to treat an emerging pandemic threat not addressed with an approved drug or vaccine at the outset of an outbreak. On March 24, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) declared that the emergence of COVID-19 justified the Emergency-Use Authorization (EUA) of drugs, biological products, and medical devices to combat the pandemic. Within a month of this HHS declaration, FDA awarded an EUA to blood purification therapies from Terumo BCT, ExThera Medical Corporation, CytoSorbents, Inc., and Baxter Healthcare Corporation. In connection with these authorizations, FDA published a statement that blood purification devices may be effective at treating patients with confirmed COVID-19 by reducing various pathogens, cytokines, and other inflammatory mediators from the bloodstream.
 
Consistent with FDA’s statement, small-scale versions of Sigyn Therapy have been quantified to reduce the presence of various pathogens, cytokines, and other inflammatory mediators from human blood plasma during in vitro studies. As such, we believe that Sigyn Therapy could provide a candidate strategy to treat future pandemic outbreaks, which are increasingly being fuelled by a confluence of global warming, urban crowding, and intercontinental travel.
 
Additionally, as a majority of infectious human viruses are not addressed with a corresponding drug or vaccine, there may be an ongoing need for blood purification technologies that offer to reduce the severity of infection and mitigate the excess production of inflammatory cytokines (the cytokine storm) associated with high mortality in non-pandemic viral infections. In this regard, we believe Sigyn Therapy aligns with HHS initiatives established through the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise (PHEMCE) that support the development of broad-spectrum medical countermeasures that can mitigate the impact of an emerging pandemic or bioterror threat, yet also have viability in established disease indications.
 
Candidate Pipeline Product
 
Beyond our focus to clinically advance Sigyn Therapy, we intend to develop a pipeline of extracorporeal blood purification therapies. In this regard, we have designed a therapeutic system to enhance the benefit of cancer chemotherapy. To support this endeavor, we disclosed on October 6, 2022, that a patent application entitled: “SYSTEM AND METHODS TO ENHANCE CHEMOTHERAPY DELIVERY AND REDUCE TOXICITY” had been filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”). On October 13, 2022, we subsequently disclosed that trademark applications to register ChemoPrepTM and ChemoPureTM were filed with the USPTO”.
 
Chemotherapeutic agents are the most commonly administered drugs to treat cancer, which is the second leading cause of death in the United States. Despite therapeutic advances, treatment toxicity, drug resistance and inadequate tumour site delivery restrict the benefit of chemotherapy. To overcome these challenges, our patent submission describes a therapeutic device system whose primary objective is to enhance tumour site delivery of chemotherapy and reduce its toxicity. A secondary objective of the system is to reduce treatment dosing without sacrificing patient benefit, or conversely increase chemotherapy dosing without added toxicity. In concert with these objectives, our candidate therapeutic system offers to inhibit the spread of cancer metastasis that can be induced by the administration of chemotherapy.

Our proposed chemotherapy enhancement system is comprised of two blood purification technologies. ChemoPrepTM, administered prior to chemotherapy to optimize tumour site delivery and improve the benefit of ChemoPureTM, which is deployed post-chemotherapy to reduce treatment toxicity and inhibit the potential spread of cancer metastasis.
 
To improve the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents, we designed ChemoPrepTM with an objective to reduce the bloodstream presence of tumour-derived extracellular vesicles or exosomes (Tumor-EXs) that diminish the efficacy of chemotherapy. As compared to non-cancer subjects, Tumor-EXs are highly concentrated in the bloodstream of those suffering from cancer. Tumor-EXs decoy and directly inhibit chemotherapeutic agents from reaching tumour cell targets. Tumor-EXs have also been reported to export chemotherapeutic agents out of cancer cells. Based on these factors, we believe the pre-chemo depletion of circulating Tumor-EXs could establish a novel, yet practical strategy to increase tumour-site saturation of chemotherapy, which in turn may permit for lower doses of chemotherapy to be administered without diminishing patient benefit.
 
ChemoPrepTM may also improve the performance of ChemoPureTM as a reduced bloodstream presence of Tumor-EXs, which are competitive binding and adsorption factors based on similar size and structural characteristics, would likely increase the efficiency of ChemoPureTM to reduce the presence of off-target chemotherapeutic agents that remain circulating in the bloodstream.
 
ChemoPureTM was designed to perform two critical functions after chemotherapy administration. To reduce treatment toxicity by lowering the bloodstream presence of chemotherapeutic agents that are not delivered to the target tumour site, and to reduce the circulating presence of chemotherapy-induced Tumor-EXs that may promote the spread of cancer metastases.
 
Unlike Sigyn TherapyTM, which is a candidate to treat life-threatening conditions that are not addressed with approved drug therapies, the intent of the ChemoPrepTM and ChemoPureTM is to enhance the delivery of market-cleared chemotherapeutic drugs and reduce their toxicity. Additionally, while Sigyn TherapyTM is a hollow-fiber based device designed for use on dialysis and continuous renal replacement machines, ChemoPrepTM and ChemoPureTM do not contain hollow-fibers and are intended for use on portable blood processing systems that can be located within the clinical sites where chemotherapy is administered. During treatment, the functionality of the blood processing system allows for patient blood plasma to flow through our devices, which contain formulations of adsorbent and binding components intended deplete Tumor-EXs and chemotherapeutic agents from the bloodstream.
 
In an in vitro study conducted by researchers at Innovative Biotherapies, we obtained pre-clinical insight that liposomal nanoparticles, commonly used to deliver chemotherapeutic agents, can be reduced from human blood plasma with a formulation of adsorbent components. In the study, liposome concentrations in human blood plasma were reduced by 92.5% after a two-hour interaction with the adsorbent components. Beyond providing initial support for our candidate strategy to remove liposomal drug agents, the study established the possibility that Tumor-EXs may also be reduced from blood plasma as liposomes have previously served as a research model system for isolating extracellular vesicles and exosomes based on a similarity of size and structural characteristics.

Government Regulation
 
In the United States, Sigyn Therapy is subject to regulation by the FDA. Should we seek to commercialize Sigyn Therapy outside the United States, we expect to face comparable international regulatory oversight. The U.S. regulatory jurisdiction for extracorporeal blood purification therapies is the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (“CDRH”), the FDA branch that oversees the market approval of medical devices.
 
Based on published CDRH guidance, we believe that Sigyn Therapy will be classified as a Class III medical device that is subject to a Pre-Market Approval (“PMA”) submission pathway. A PMA pathway requires extensive data, including but not limited to technical documents, preclinical studies, animal studies, human clinical trials, the establishment of Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”) standards and labelling that fulfils FDA’s requirement to demonstrate reasonable evidence of safety and effectiveness of a medical device product. However, as Sigyn Therapy does not emit electronic product radiation, it will not be subject to regulatory challenges associated with medical devices that emit electronic radiation.

The commercialization of medical devices in the United States requires either a prior 510(k) clearance, unless it is exempt, or a PMA from the FDA. Generally, if a new device has a predicate that is already on the market under a 510(k) clearance, the FDA will allow that new device to be marketed under a 510(k) clearance; otherwise, a premarket approval, or PMA, is required. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes; Class I, Class II or Class III which are determined by the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are deemed to be low risk and are subject to the general controls of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, such as provisions that relate to: adulteration; misbranding; registration and listing; notification, including repair, replacement, or refund; records and reports; and good manufacturing practices. Most Class I devices are classified as exempt from pre-market notification under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act, and therefore may be commercially distributed without obtaining 510(k) clearance from the FDA. Class II devices are subject to both general controls and special controls to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Special controls include performance standards, post market surveillance, patient registries and guidance documents. A manufacturer may be required to submit to the FDA a pre-market notification requesting permission to commercially distribute some Class II devices. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III. A Class III device cannot be marketed in the United States unless the FDA approves the device after submission of a PMA. We believe that Sigyn Therapy will be classified as a Class III device and as such will be subject to a PMA submission and approval.
 
Should Sigyn Therapy receive market clearance from FDA, we would need to comply with applicable laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, storage, distribution, advertising and promotion, and post-marketing surveillance reporting for medical devices. Failure to comply with these applicable requirements may subject a device and/or its manufacturer to a variety of administrative sanctions, such as issuance of warning letters, import detentions, civil monetary penalties and/or judicial sanctions, such as product seizures, injunctions and criminal prosecution. Our failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
 
The Pre-market Approval Pathway
 
A pre-market approval (PMA) application must be submitted to the FDA for Class III devices for which FDA requires a PMA. The PMA application process is much more demanding than the 510(k)-pre-market notification process. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data, including but not limited to technical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction reasonable evidence of safety and effectiveness of the device.
 
After a PMA application is submitted, the FDA has 45 days to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review and thus whether the FDA will file the application for review. The FDA has 180 days to review a filed PMA application, although the review of an application generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of the information already provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device.
 
Although the FDA is not bound by the advisory panel decision, the panel’s recommendations are important to the FDA decision making process. In addition, the FDA may conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR. The agency also may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with FDA’s regulations.
 
Upon completion of the PMA review, the FDA may: (i) approve the PMA which authorizes commercial marketing with specific prescribing information for one or more indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought; (ii) issue an approvable letter which indicates the FDA’s belief that the PMA is approvable and states what additional information the FDA requires, or the post-approval commitments that must be agreed to prior to approval; issue a not approvable letter which outlines steps required for approval, but which are typically more onerous than those in an approvable letter, and may require additional clinical trials that are often expensive and time consuming and can delay approval for months or even years; or (iv) deny the application. If the FDA issues an approvable or not approvable letter, the applicant has 180 days to respond, after which the FDA’s review clock is reset.

Clinical Trials
 
Clinical trials are almost always required to support PMA market clearance and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. In the United States, for significant risk Class III devices, these trials require submission of an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specific number of patients at specified study sites. During the trial, the sponsor must comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements for investigator selection, trial monitoring, reporting and record keeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices and comply with all reporting and record keeping requirements. Clinical trials for Class III devices may not begin until the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards, or IRBs, at the clinical trial sites. An IRB is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor medical research involving subjects and which has the authority to approve, require modifications in, or disapprove research to protect the rights, safety and welfare of human research subjects. The FDA or the IRB at each site at which a clinical trial is being performed may withdraw approval of a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the benefits or a failure to comply with FDA or IRB requirements. Even if a trial is completed, there is no assurance that clinical testing will demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of Sigyn Therapy or other pipeline devices.
Manufacturing and Procurement
 
We are advancing a manufacturing relationship with an FDA registered Contract Manufacturing Organization (CMO) to establish cGMPs compliant manufacturing to support human clinical studies and potential commercialization should we receive clearance to market Sigyn Therapy. We plan to establish manufacturing procedure specifications that define each stage of our manufacturing, inspection and testing processes and the control parameters or acceptance criteria that apply to each activity that result in the production of our technology.
 
We have also established relationships with industry vendors that provide components necessary to manufacture our device. Should the relationship with an industry vendor be interrupted or discontinued, we believe that alternate component suppliers can be identified to support the continued manufacturing of our product. However, delays related to interrupted or discontinued vendor relationships could adversely impact our business.
 
Research and Product Development
 
To date, we have outsourced our research and product development activities, which include the performance of in vitro blood plasma validation studies, animal studies, pre-cGMPs product assembly and manufacturing through third party organizations with experience in advancing extracorporeal blood purification technologies. Our pre-clinical in vitro blood plasma studies we each performed under an agreement with Innovative BioTherapies, Inc. (IBT) and our animal clinical studies were conducted by IBT team members through a contract with the University of Michigan to utilize animal care, associated institutional review oversight, as well as surgical suite facilities located within the North Campus Research Complex. While we maintain ownership rights to all study data collected by IBT, we do permit for IBT to publish or present the results of our contracted studies. At present, we do not have plans to build and staff our own research and product development facility.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
 
At present, our operations are not subject to any environmental laws or regulations.
 
Employees
 
As of the date of this filing, we have 4 salaried employees, whose benefits include paid medical, dental, and vision coverage. We also provide our employees with access to a 401(k) plan, and we anticipate the establishment of an employee equity-stock option plan during the 2023 calendar year. To maintain a manageable employee headcount, we utilize non-employee consultants to perform as-needed services and we contract with third party research organizations to perform studies designed to support the potential clinical advancement of Sigyn Therapy.
