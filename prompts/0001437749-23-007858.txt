Recent Developments
 
Entry into Arrangement Agreement
 
On December 4, 2022, FitLife entered into an Arrangement Agreement (the “Arrangement Agreement”) with 1000374984 Ontario Inc. (“Subsidiary”, and collectively with FitLife, the “Company”), and Mimi’s Rock Corp. (“MRC”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire MRC for a total cash purchase price of approximately $17.0 million (CAD $23.2 million), of which approximately $10.4 million (CAD $14.2 million) would be used to retire all of MRC’s outstanding indebtedness, and approximately $6.6 million (CAD $9.0 million) would be used to purchase all issued and outstanding shares of MRC from its current shareholders (collectively, the “Purchase Price”) (the “Acquisition”).
 
The Arrangement Agreement was subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan of Arrangement, attached to the Arrangement Agreement as Schedule A (“Plan”), which Plan was made in accordance with Section 182 of the Ontario Business Corporations Act and required a court order approving the Plan.  Further, to finance the acquisition of MRC, which amount was paid in all cash, the Company’s principal bank, First Citizens Bank (the “Bank”), agreed to provide up to $12.5 million in debt financing. The obligations of the Company and MRC to consummate the Acquisition were subject to certain closing conditions, including, but not limited to, (i) the taking of all steps set forth in the Interim Order (as defined in the Arrangement Agreement) and Final Order (as defined in the Arrangement Agreement); (ii) the approval of MRC’s shareholders, and (iii) receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals.

Subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, the Acquisition was consummated on February 28, 2023.
 
Entry into Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
 
On February 23, 2023 (the “Loan Closing Date”), the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with the Bank (the “Credit Agreement”), amending and restating that certain Credit Agreement, dated September 24, 2019, between the Company and the Bank. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Bank provided the Company with a term loan for the principal amount of $12.5 million (“Term Loan”), and a revolving line of credit of $3.5 million (the “Credit Line”, and collectively with the Term Loan, the “Loan”). The Company used the proceeds from the Loan to fund the consummation of the Acquisition (as defined below), and for general working capital purposes, including those of MRC (as defined below).
 
Pursuant to the Credit Agreement: (A) the Term Loan (i) accrues interest at a per annum rate equal to 2.75% above the one-month forward-looking term rate (the “Applicable Rate”), based on the secured overnight financing rate published for such day by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (“Term SOFR Rate”), as in effect two banking days, subject to certain limitations, prior to (a) the Loan Closing Date, in the case of the initial Term SOFR Rate, and, (b) thereafter, the applicable first day of each calendar month (“Rate Adjustment Date”), adjusted for any reserve requirement and any subsequent costs arising from a change in government regulation; and (ii) and the Company shall make payments on March 10th, June 10th, September 10th, and December 10th of each calendar year, commencing on June 10, 2023, of principal plus accrued interest on the Term Loan in amounts sufficient to fully amortize the Term Loan through February 28, 2028 (the “Term Loan Maturity Date”), with all principal and accrued interest on the Term Loan being due and payable in full on the Term Loan Maturity Date; and (B) outstanding advances under the Line of Credit (“Advances”) will accrue interest at the Applicable Rate, and commencing on April 1, 2023, and continuing on the 1st day of each calendar month thereafter until December 23, 2023, or the date of the termination in whole of the Line of Credit as otherwise set forth in the Amended and Restated Agreement (the “LOC Termination Date”), the Company shall make payments of accrued interest on Advances, and all principal and accrued interest on outstanding Advances shall be due and payable in full on the LOC Termination Date. The Company may prepay amounts borrowed under the Loan, in whole or in part with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the amount prepaid, by written notice to Bank at least one business day prior to the proposed prepayment.
 
The Agreement contains customary events of default (each an “Event of Default”), which upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, among other things, interest will accrue at the Applicable Rate plus 2% per annum, and the Bank may declare all Obligations, with interest thereon, immediately due and payable. The Credit Agreement further contains: (X) customary representations and warranties of the Company; (Y) customary indemnification provisions whereby the Company will indemnify Bank for certain losses arising out of inaccuracies in, or breaches of, the representations, warranties and covenants of the Company, and certain other matters; and (Z) customary affirmative and negative covenants, including, without limitation, covenants: (i) to maintain a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not less than 1.25 to 1.00 as tested quarterly on a trailing twelve-month basis, starting with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2023; (ii) to maintain a Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not more than 2.50 to 1.00 as tested quarterly on a trailing twelve-month basis, starting with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2024; (iii) not to incur any indebtedness, except indebtedness already incurred on the date of the Credit Agreement, incurred for capital leases and purchase money obligations for fixed assets less than $100,000 without the Bank’s prior approval, and payable to trade creditors in the ordinary course of business; (iv) not to undertake certain fundamental or corporate changes; and (v) not to make certain Dispositions (as defined in the Credit Agreement).
 
Also on the Loan Closing Date, in connection with the Credit Agreement, the Company: (A) entered into a term note evidencing the Term Loan (the “Term Note”); (B) entered into a Security Agreement, by and between the Company, NDS Nutrition Products, Inc. (“NDS”), iSatori, Inc. (“IS”), Subsidiary (Subsidiary is collectively with the Company, NDS, and IS, the “Debtors”), and the Bank (the “Security Agreement”), pursuant to which all of the Company’s obligations arising from or related to the Loan (the “Obligations”) will be secured by the following assets of each of the Debtors: (i) accounts, contract rights, documents, documents of title, payment intangibles, investment property, chattel paper, instruments, deposit accounts and letter of credit right; (ii) inventory; (iii) equipment; (iv) general intangibles, including any intellectual property, consisting of any licenses, patents, copyrights, trademarks, proprietary source code or domain names; (v) accessions, attachments and other additions to the collateral; (vi) substitutes or replacements for any collateral, all proceeds, products, rents and profits of any collateral, all rights under warranties and insurance contracts covering the collateral, and any causes of action relating to the collateral; and (vii) books and records pertaining to any Collateral, including but not limited to any computer-readable memory and any computer hardware or software necessary to process such memory; and (C) approved that NDS, IS, and Ontario (collectively, the “Subsidiaries”) entered into a Guaranty Agreement with the Bank (the “Guaranty Agreement”), pursuant to which satisfaction of the Obligations by the Company are guaranteed by each of the Subsidiaries.
 
COVID-19 Pandemic
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has had an effect on the Company’s employees, business and operations and those of its customers, vendors and business partners. In this respect, the temporary or permanent closure of some of our retail partners’ store locations and the stay-at-home orders that occurred early in the pandemic negatively affected our results from operations, although much of the impact has been offset by an increase in revenue attributable to online sales, and increased sales during the more recent quarters. Our future financial position and operating results could be materially and adversely affected in the event that a resurgence of COVID-19 cases leads to new stay-at-home orders and/or further disruptions in both our supply chain and manufacturing lead-times, which could lower demand for the Company’s products and/or prevent the Company from producing and delivering its products in a timely manner, although the extent of these effects cannot be determined at this time. The Company expects to continue to assess the evolving impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and intends to make adjustments to its business and operations accordingly. 
Inflation
 
The Company has experienced inflationary pressure with regard to the procurement of many of its products.  Thus far, the Company has been able to offset the impact of inflation through price increases to its customers.  In the future, however, further inflationary pressure could adversely affect the Company's operating performance if market conditions no longer permit the Company to pass through price increases to its customers.

Manufacturing, Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
All of the Company’s products are manufactured by FDA-regulated contract manufacturers within the United States and Canada. Each contract manufacturer is required by the Company to abide by current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”) to ensure quality and consistency, and to manufacture its products according to the Company’s strict specifications, and nearly all our contract manufacturers are certified through a governing body such as the NPA (“Natural Products Association”) or NSF International. In most cases, contract manufacturers purchase the raw materials based on the Company’s specifications; however, from time to time, the Company will license particular raw material ingredients and supply its own source to the manufacturer. Once produced, in addition to in-house testing performed by the contract manufacturer, the Company may also perform independent analysis and testing. The contract manufacturer either ships the finished product to one of our fulfillment centers or directly to our customers. The Company has implemented vendor qualification programs for all of its suppliers and manufacturers, including analytical testing of purchased products. As part of the vendor program, the Company also periodically inspects vendors’ facilities to monitor quality control and assurance procedures.
Product Reformulations and New Product Identification
 
From time to time we reformulate existing products to address market developments and trends, and to respond to customer requests. We also continually expand our product line through the development of new products. New product ideas are derived from a number of sources including trade publications, scientific and health journals, consultants, distributors, and other third parties. Prior to reformulating existing products or introducing new products, we investigate product formulations as they relate to regulatory compliance and other issues. We introduced a total of 10 new products during the year ended December 31, 2022, which included 3 completely new products and 7 product reformulations and flavor extensions, and we introduced a total of 15 new products during the year ended December 31, 2021, which included 4 completely new products and 11 product reformulations and flavor extensions.
 
Management continually assesses and analyzes developing market trends to detect and proactively address what they believe are areas of unmet or growing demand that represent an opportunity for the Company and, where deemed appropriate, attempt to introduce new products and/or packaging solutions in direct response to meet that demand.
 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 
NDS Products
 
NDS Products are sold through more than 770 GNC franchise locations located throughout the United States. The Company also distributes NDS Products to additional franchise locations in other countries. In 2014, the Company transitioned distribution of NDS Products to GNC’s centralized distribution platform. Prior to the change, the majority of the Company’s revenue was realized upon direct shipment of NDS Products to individual franchise locations. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the majority of NDS Product sales were through GNC’s centralized distribution platform.
 
Our sales and marketing efforts are designed to expand sales of NDS Products to additional GNC franchise locations both domestically and internationally. In addition, we relaunched our Core Active brand as a new online-exclusive brand. The GNC domestic franchise market remains the core of our operations. Management is committed to continue to work collaboratively with GNC and its franchisees to build on our established track record of growth and innovation.
 
iSatori Products
 
iSatori Products are distributed directly to consumers through the Company's own websites and through other e-commerce platforms such as Amazon.com, Inc. ("Amazon"), as well as through the specialty, drug and mass-market distribution channels. iSatori products are currently sold in over 17,000 retail locations.
 
    -4- 

  

In some cases, iSatori utilizes independent brokers, who work in conjunction with iSatori’s sales employees and management to oversee the drug and mass-market channels. iSatori sells its products to mass-market merchandisers either directly or through distributors of nutritional supplement products. In addition to the Company’s online distribution channels for direct-to-consumer sales, major iSatori customers include CVS, Rite Aid, Vitamin Shoppe, Walgreens and Wal-Mart.
 
iSatori’s core strategy is to build and strengthen brands among consumers seeking nutritional supplement products with a reputation for quality and innovation. iSatori utilizes social media campaigns, coupons, and online advertising, plus cooperative and other incentive programs, to build consumer awareness and generate trial and repeat purchases to drive sales revenue. Our marketing team regularly reviews the media mix for its effectiveness in creating consumer demand and the highest return on investment dollars.
 
Product Returns
 
We currently have a 30-day product return policy for NDS Products, which allows for a 100% sales price refund for the return of unopened and undamaged products purchased from us online through one of our websites. Product sold to GNC may be returned from store shelves or the distribution center in the event the product is damaged, short dated, expired or recalled. GNC maintains a customer satisfaction program that allows customers to return product to the store for credit or refund. Subject to certain terms and restrictions, GNC may require reimbursement from vendors for unsaleable returned product through either direct payment or credit against a future invoice. We also support a product return policy for iSatori Products, whereby customers can return product for credit or refund. Product returns can and do occur from time to time and can be material.
Competition
 
The nutrition industry is highly competitive, and the Company has many competitors that sell products similar to the Company’s products. Many of the Company’s competitors have significantly greater financial and human resources than our own. The Company seeks to differentiate its products and marketing from its competitors based on product quality, benefits, and functional ingredients. Patent and trademark applications that protect brands, product names, and new technologies are pursued whenever possible. While we cannot assure that such measures will block competitive products, we believe our continued emphasis on innovation and new product development targeted at the needs of the consumer will enable the Company to effectively compete in the marketplace.
Regulatory Matters
 
Our business is subject to varying degrees of regulation by a number of government authorities in the U.S., including the Federal Drug Administration (“FDA”), the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Various agencies of the states and localities in which we operate and in which our products are sold also regulate our business, such as the California Department of Health Services, Food and Drug Branch. The areas of our business that these and other authorities regulate include, among others:

● | product claims and advertising;
--+--------------------------------


● | product labels;
--+----------------


● | product ingredients; and
--+-------------------------


● | how we manufacture, package, distribute, import, export, sell, and store our products.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    -5- 

  

The FDA, in particular, regulates the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, storage, labeling, promotion, distribution and sale of vitamins and other nutritional supplements in the U.S., while the FTC regulates marketing and advertising claims. In August 2007, a new rule issued by the FDA went into effect requiring companies that manufacture, package, label, distribute or hold nutritional supplements to meet cGMPs to ensure such products are of the quality specified and are properly packaged and labeled. We are committed to meeting or exceeding the standards set by the FDA and believe we are currently operating within the FDA mandated cGMPs.
 
The FDA also regulates the labeling and marketing of dietary supplements and nutritional products, including the following:
 

● | the identification of dietary supplements or nutritional products and their nutrition and ingredient labeling;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | requirements related to the wording used for claims about nutrients, health claims, and statements of nutritional support;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | labeling requirements for dietary supplements or nutritional products for which “high potency” and “antioxidant” claims are made;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | notification procedures for statements on dietary supplements or nutritional products; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | premarket notification procedures for new dietary ingredients in nutritional supplements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (“DSHEA”) revised the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) concerning the composition and labeling of dietary supplements, and defined dietary supplements to include vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids and other dietary substances used to supplement diets. DSHEA generally provides a regulatory framework to help ensure safe, quality dietary supplements and the dissemination of accurate information about such products. The FDA is generally prohibited from regulating active ingredients in dietary supplements as drugs unless product claims, such as claims that a product may heal, mitigate, cure or prevent an illness, disease or malady, trigger drug status.
 
DSHEA also permits statements of nutritional support to be included in labeling for nutritional supplements without FDA premarket approval. These statements must be submitted to the FDA within 30 days of marketing and must bear a label disclosure that includes the following: “This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.” These statements may describe a benefit related to a nutrient deficiency disease, the role of a nutrient or nutritional ingredient intended to affect the structure or function in humans, the documented mechanism by which a nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain such structure or function, or the general well-being from consumption of a nutrient or dietary ingredient, but may not expressly or implicitly represent that a nutritional supplement will diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent a disease. An entity that uses a statement of nutritional support in labeling must possess scientific evidence substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading. If the FDA determines that a particular statement of nutritional support is an unacceptable drug claim or an unauthorized version of a disease claim for a food product, or if the FDA determines that a particular claim is not adequately supported by existing scientific data or is false or misleading, we will be prevented from using the claim. 
 
In addition, DSHEA provides that so-called “third-party literature”, for example a reprint of a peer-reviewed scientific publication linking a particular nutritional ingredient with health benefits, may be used in connection with the sale of a nutritional supplement to consumers without the literature being subject to regulation as labeling. Such literature must not be false or misleading; the literature may not promote a particular manufacturer or brand of nutritional supplement; the literature must present a balanced view of the available scientific information on the nutritional supplement; if displayed in an establishment, the literature must be physically separate from the nutritional supplement; and the literature may not have appended to it any information by sticker or any other method. If the literature fails to satisfy each of these requirements, we may be prevented from disseminating it with our products, and any dissemination could subject our products to regulatory action as an illegal drug. Moreover, any written or verbal representation by us that would associate a nutrient in a product that we sell with an effect on a disease will be deemed evidence of intent to sell the product as an unapproved new drug, a violation of the FDCA. 
 
In December 2006, the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act (“DSNDCPA”) was passed, which further revised the provisions of the FDCA. Under the act, manufacturers, packers or distributors whose name appears on the product label of a dietary supplement or nonprescription drug are required to include contact information on the product label for consumers to use in reporting adverse events associated with the product’s use and are required to notify the FDA of any serious adverse event report within 15 business days of receiving such report. Events reported to the FDA would not be considered an admission from a company that its product caused or contributed to the reported event. We are committed to meeting or exceeding the requirements of the DSNDCPA.
 
    -6- 

  

We are also subject to a variety of other regulations in the U.S., including those relating to bioterrorism, taxes, labor and employment, import and export, the environment, and intellectual property. All of these regulations require significant financial and operational resources to ensure compliance, and we cannot assure that we will always be in compliance despite our best efforts to do so.
 
Our operations outside the U.S. are similarly regulated by various agencies and entities in the countries in which we operate and in which our products are sold. The regulations of these countries may conflict with those in the U.S. and may vary from country to country. The sale of our products in certain European countries is subject to the rules and regulations of the European Union, which may be interpreted differently among the countries within the European Union. In other markets outside the U.S., we may be required to obtain approvals, licenses or certifications from a country’s ministry of health or comparable agency before we begin operations or the marketing of products in that country. Approvals or licenses may be conditioned on the reformulation of our products for a particular market or may be unavailable for certain products or product ingredients. These regulations may limit our ability to enter certain markets outside the U.S. Similar to the costs of regulatory compliance in the U.S., foreign regulations require significant financial and operational resources to ensure compliance, and we cannot assure that we will always be in compliance despite our best efforts to do so. Our failure to maintain regulatory compliance within and outside the U.S. could impact our ability to sell our products, and thus, materially impact our financial position and results of operations.
 
Patents, Trademarks and Proprietary Rights
 
The Company regards intellectual property, including its trademarks, service marks, website URLs (domains) and other proprietary rights, as valuable assets and part of its brand equity. The Company believes that protecting such intellectual property is crucial to its business strategy. The Company pursues registration of the registrable trademarks, service marks and patents, associated with its key products in the United States, Canada, Europe and other places it distributes its products.
 
The Company formulates its products using proprietary ingredient formulations, flavorings and delivery systems. To further protect its product formulations and flavors, the Company may enter into agreements with manufacturers that provide exclusivity to certain products formulations and delivery technologies. When appropriate, the Company will seek to protect its research and development efforts by filing patent applications for proprietary product technologies or ingredient combinations. We have abandoned or not pursued efforts to register certain other patents and marks identifying other items in our product line for various reasons, including the inability of some names to qualify for registration or patent applications to qualify for patent protection, and due to our abandonment of certain such products. All trademark registrations are protected for a period of ten years and then are renewable thereafter if still in use.
 
Employees
 
We had 27 and 25 full-time employees as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In addition, the Company retains consultants for certain services on an as-needed basis. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Cost of Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
We have not incurred any costs associated with compliance with environmental regulations, nor do we anticipate any future costs associated with environmental compliance; however, no assurances can be given that we will not incur such costs in the future.
Available Information
 
As a public company, we are required to file our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements on Schedule 14A and other information (including any amendments) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
