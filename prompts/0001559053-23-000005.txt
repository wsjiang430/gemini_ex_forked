ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Prothena is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company with expertise in protein dysregulation and a pipeline of investigational therapeutics with the potential to change the course of devastating neurodegenerative and rare peripheral amyloid diseases.
Fueled by our deep scientific expertise built over decades of research, we are advancing a pipeline of therapeutic candidates for a number of indications and novel targets for which our ability to integrate scientific insights around neurological dysfunction and the biology of misfolded proteins can be leveraged. Our wholly-owned programs include birtamimab for the potential treatment of AL amyloidosis and a portfolio of programs for the potential treatment of Alzheimer’s disease including PRX012, which targets Amyloid beta (Aβ), and PRX123, a novel dual Aβ-tau vaccine. Our partnered programs include prasinezumab, in collaboration with Roche for the potential treatment of Parkinson’s disease and other related synucleinopathies, and programs that target tau (PRX005), TDP-43, and an undisclosed target (PRX019) in collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) for the potential treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and other neurodegenerative diseases. We are also entitled to certain potential milestone payments pursuant to our share purchase agreement with Novo Nordisk pertaining to our ATTR amyloidosis business (NNC6019, formerly PRX004).
We were formed on September 26, 2012, under the laws of Ireland and re-registered as an Irish public limited company on October 25, 2012. Our ordinary shares began trading on The Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “PRTA” on December 21, 2012, and currently trade on The Nasdaq Global Select Market.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to be a leading biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of novel therapies to treat diseases caused by protein dysregulation. 
Under certain pathological conditions, the process by which proteins fold into specific conformations to carry out their intended biological activities becomes dysregulated. When this happens, proteins misfold and propagate many diseases that are not adequately addressed by current therapies. Proteins that misfold and aggregate to form amyloid are associated with a multitude of common and rare human diseases that can gravely damage vital organs. Amyloid can affect any organ in the body. Our pipeline reflects our deep understanding of the contribution of these toxic proteins to the cause and progression of disease. For example, the misfolding and aggregation of the amyloid beta (Aβ) protein leads to a build-up of amyloid in the brain, which scientists believe is the primary cause of Alzheimer’s disease. Parkinson’s disease is characterized by neuronal dysfunction and loss caused by the cell-to-cell spreading of toxic forms of aggregated alpha-synuclein protein. Transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR amyloidosis), and AL amyloidosis are rare, progressive and fatal diseases, characterized by deposition of aggregated misfolded transthyretin and light chain proteins, respectively, in vital organs such as the heart. 
We leverage pioneering protein dysregulation science to develop novel therapeutic solutions that directly target pathogenic proteins in order to change the course of devastating neurodegenerative and rare peripheral amyloid diseases. We are advancing a broad pipeline of therapies with novel mechanisms of action that are uniquely suited to address unmet medical needs in targeted patient populations.
Our plan is to become a fully integrated research, development, and commercial biotechnology company. Three late-stage programs in our pipeline are ongoing, including AFFIRM-AL, a registration-enabling Phase 3 study of birtamimab in Mayo Stage IV patients with AL amyloidosis being conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) agreement with FDA with significance level of p ≤ 0.10, a Phase 2b PADOVA study of prasinezumab in patients with early Parkinson’s disease being conducted by Roche, and a Phase 2 study of NNC6019 (formerly PRX004) in patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy being conducted by Novo Nordisk. In addition, we are advancing a robust portfolio of Alzheimer’s disease programs designed to target the underlying disease pathology. These programs include PRX012, an anti-Aβ antibody designed to be best-in-class and dosed subcutaneously; PRX005, an investigational antibody that specifically targets a key epitope within the microtubule binding region (MTBR) of tau, and a potential best-in-class treatment, which is partnered with BMS; and PRX123, a dual Aβ-tau vaccine for the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer’s disease.
Key elements of our strategy to achieve our goal are to:
•Concentrate our discovery and development efforts in areas where we have decades of scientific expertise and experience.
We leverage our core scientific expertise and proven protein dysregulation platform to develop novel therapeutics for the potential treatment of neurodegenerative and rare peripheral amyloid diseases. 
Our pipeline is advanced by a team with scientific expertise and a track record of discovering and developing innovative, and often first-in-class programs. Our legacy includes fundamental discoveries in the understanding of Alzheimer’s disease biology including identifying and elucidating the role Aβ plays in Alzheimer’s disease pathology and discovering the biological cause of amyloid related imaging abnormalities (“ARIA”). These findings led to the development of a drug discovery and development organization that generated first-in-class clinical candidates in Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and AL and ATTR amyloidosis.
Key elements of our biology-directed discovery engine include:
•A focus on pathophysiology-directed targeting focused on targeting proteins with the greatest effect on disease;
•Expert epitope mapping with deep expertise in determining optimal epitopes to be targeted for maximal efficacy; and 
•Disease driven antibody engineering for therapeutics engineered to optimally eliminate pathogenic proteins while preserving normal biology
Once we formulate a novel hypothesis or approach, we determine how to optimally intervene against a known target. We employ a combination of our understanding of normal protein structure, computational antibody design technologies, and an empirical and unbiased screening process to determine the optimal epitope to target on a pathogenic protein. Through our detailed screening process, we attempted to define critical regions of the protein involved in the pathological progression of a particular disease to elucidate key epitopes that are hidden when a protein is normally folded but exposed when a protein misfolds and remains exposed in all of its pathogenic aggregation states, inclusive of deposited amyloid. We engineer our molecules to interact with that epitope in a way that is most likely to intercept or halt the underlying disease process. We do this by designing molecules with a bias toward the pathogenic forms of the protein. We then develop a multitude of antibodies against the target, characterize specific and selective antibodies in vitro, and then use them to test the initial hypothesis in vivo using animal models of disease, assuming such models exist or can be successfully developed. We often rely on the use of preclinical models that have been extensively developed to establish early proof of concept for our programs. We leverage our insight of disease pathology and, when possible, employ biomarker endpoints as a way to detect signals of biological activity. We may elect to start clinical testing in indications that have well-established endpoints in order to demonstrate proof of concept as a basis for further investment in clinical trials, either by us or by potential partners.
Our biology-directed engine aims to produce molecules that specifically and selectively target the toxic, or pathogenic, protein species in order to alleviate their detrimental effects, while - to the furthest extent possible - leaving the native, or healthy, form of the protein unaffected. 
We have employed our discovery engine to optimally target key epitopes on misfolded proteins including Aβ, tau, alpha-synuclein, light chain, and transthyretin to relevantly influence biology and achieve clinical benefit across a number of indications. 
As a result, decades of our own investigation augmented by the work of others have elucidated that targeting the appropriate epitope, with the optimal binding strength (affinity) in the context of the right clinical design with appropriate endpoints in the right patient population can result in meaningful clinical benefit. Our track record of combining these elements to discover and develop novel therapeutic candidates has resulted in a robust pipeline advancing multiple late-stage programs.
Today, one of the elements that distinguishes Prothena is that our pipeline has matured beyond demonstrating target engagement via downstream biomarkers. Instead, our internally discovered pipeline has generated multiple proof points that our molecules have successfully influenced biology in a manner that translates into clinical benefit. We’ve most recently demonstrated this in AL amyloidosis, ATTR amyloidosis, and Parkinson’s disease where preclinical findings in our programs have translated to positive clinical data. 
•Focus on diseases that lack effective therapies.
We focus on the development of therapies for serious and/or life-threatening diseases that currently lack effective therapies or in areas where current therapies have known limitations. Our efforts in AL amyloidosis, ATTR amyloidosis, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and other neurological or peripheral amyloid diseases are examples of this.
In Parkinson’s disease, currently approved therapies focus on the alleviation of early motor symptoms without addressing the underlying cause of the disease. We are focusing our efforts to develop a therapeutic with the potential to slow the progression of Parkinson’s disease by targeting α-synuclein protein. Synucleins are a family of proteins, of which there are three known members: α-synuclein, β-synuclein, and γ-synuclein. The α- and β-synuclein proteins are found primarily in brain tissue. There is genetic evidence that α-synuclein plays a fundamental role in Parkinson’s disease, and an increasing body of evidence demonstrates that pathogenic forms of α-synuclein can be propagated and transmitted from cell to cell. Our scientists have developed prasinezumab, an investigational monoclonal antibody targeting the pathogenic aggregated form of α-synuclein, that is designed to slow or reduce the neurodegeneration associated with α-synuclein misfolding and/or its transmission. We are developing prasinezumab, in collaboration with Roche, for the potential treatment of Parkinson’s disease and other related synucleinopathies.
AL amyloidosis and ATTR amyloidosis are diseases caused by misfolded, pathogenic forms of light chain (AL) or transthyretin (ATTR) protein that deposit as amyloid in vital organs such as the heart. Current therapeutic approaches seek to reduce the production of new pathogenic AL or ATTR protein in order to slow the formation of new amyloid deposits. However, simply reducing new pathogenic protein production may not be adequate for patients who are at high risk of early mortality due to the substantial existing amyloid deposition in their vital organs. The therapeutic approaches we are developing with birtamimab for AL amyloidosis and NNC6019 (formerly PRX004) for ATTR amyloidosis, are investigational monoclonal antibodies designed to clear the pathogenic amyloid deposits. Birtamimab and NNC6019 are designed to target and clear amyloid deposited in organs in order to improve organ function. Current therapies do not adequately address the needs of patients with AL and ATTR amyloidosis who have advanced stages of cardiac disease due to amyloid deposition. Improving survival for these patients is an area of urgent need which directly aligns with birtamimab and NNC6019’s differentiated depleter mechanism that targets the amyloid that causes organ dysfunction and failure and puts patients at risk for early mortality. 
Moving forward, we intend to advance new discovery-stage therapeutics for other diseases of protein dysregulation with unmet medical needs. Our discovery effort targeting TDP-43 for the potential treatment of amyotropic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an example of this.
•Pursue strategic business development opportunities and collaborations and leverage external resources.
We capitalize on a foundation of internal discovery efforts augmented by collaborations with academic and industry partners and business development activities to build upon our internally generated pipeline.
Our robust discovery engine generates new targets and compounds that have the potential to treat unmet medical needs. For investigational therapeutic programs targeting broad patient populations that may require large clinical trials and development investment, we may seek to collaborate or license these programs to pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for development and/or commercialization. Our collaboration with Roche to develop prasinezumab for the potential treatment of Parkinson’s disease and other related synucleinopathies and our global neuroscience R&D collaboration with BMS focused on three proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases are examples of this, as is the acquisition of our ATTR amyloidosis business by Novo Nordisk. Within these types of collaborations, we will evaluate several strategic options for designing and operationalizing early to late-stage development programs. This includes evaluating the option of designing and operationalizing clinical programs ourselves or with a partner. 
We also consider opportunities to acquire or license rights or invest in differentiated product candidates or technologies to complement our existing R&D pipeline.
We rely on, and will expand as appropriate, strong internal talent with expertise in our core areas of focus. We also rely on external resources, as needed, to execute efficiently on our clinical development and other business objectives. We engage and collaborate with consultants and advisors with certain scientific, clinical or other functional and/or disease area expertise to help us execute specific activities related to our programs. This may include activities such as testing and characterizing our potential therapeutic candidates and gaining feedback and guidance on our programs through advisory boards.
•Pursue commercialization strategies to maximize the value of our product candidates or future potential products.
As we move our drug candidates through development toward regulatory approval, we will evaluate several strategic options for commercialization. These options include building our own internal sales force; forging partnerships with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, to jointly sell and market the product; pursuing regional licensing agreements in markets where we do not have expertise or infrastructure; and out-licensing or selling the product, whereby another pharmaceutical or biotechnology company sells and markets the product and pays us a royalty on sales. We evaluate options for each product based on a number of factors including commercial synergies and expertise, capital necessary to execute on each option, size of the market to be addressed, and the expertise and terms of potential offers from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Our collaboration with Roche for the potential commercialization of prasinezumab is an example of this strategy, as is the acquisition of our ATTR amyloidosis business by Novo Nordisk.
Our Research and Development Pipeline
Our clinical research and development pipeline includes five therapeutic antibody programs in clinical development: birtamimab for the potential treatment of AL amyloidosis; prasinezumab, in collaboration with Roche, for the potential treatment of Parkinson’s disease and other related synucleinopathies; NNC6019, which is being developed by Novo Nordisk, for the potential treatment of ATTR amyloidosis; PRX012 for the potential treatment of Alzheimer’s disease; and PRX005, in collaboration with BMS, for the potential treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.
In addition to our clinical development pipeline, we have a number of discovery- and late-preclinical-stage programs targeting proteins implicated in neurological diseases including Aβ and tau for the potential treatment and prevention of Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders, and TDP-43 for the potential treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. TDP-43 and a third undisclosed neurodegenerative target are the focus of our collaboration with BMS. We have also prioritized and selected the lead candidate for our Alzheimer’s disease vaccine program, PRX123.
While we are modality agnostic, we have deep expertise in antibody targeting and have developed a diverse pipeline that includes antibody as well as small molecule and vaccine approaches. We believe a diverse portfolio positions us to make an impact on a broad spectrum of diseases and we may also pursue opportunities in other modalities such as gene and cell therapies.
The following table summarizes the status of our research and development pipeline:
Birtamimab for the Potential Treatment of AL Amyloidosis
About Birtamimab and AL Amyloidosis
Birtamimab is an investigational humanized antibody that targets toxic misfolded light chain that causes organ dysfunction and failure in patients with AL amyloidosis. AL amyloidosis is a rare, progressive, and typically fatal disease where immunoglobulin light chain proteins produced by clonal plasma cells misfold, aggregate, and deposit as amyloid in vital organs. These toxic aggregates and amyloid deposits cause progressive damage and failure of vital organs, including the heart. 
Birtamimab binds to both soluble and insoluble amyloid aggregates in multiple organs and promotes the clearance of amyloid deposits via phagocytosis. This depleter mechanism of action broadly targets misfolded kappa and lambda light chain to clear deposited amyloid that causes organ dysfunction and failure in patients with AL amyloidosis. Birtamimab is the only investigational therapeutic that has demonstrated a significant survival benefit in patients with Mayo Stage IV AL amyloidosis. Birtamimab has been granted Fast Track Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of Mayo Stage IV patients with AL amyloidosis to reduce the risk of mortality and has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by both the FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA).
It is estimated that 200,000 to 400,000 patients globally suffer from this rare disease, with approximately 60,000 to 120,000 (or 30%) of those patients being categorized as Mayo Stage IV. Patients categorized at diagnosis as Mayo Stage IV have poor outcomes with current standard-of-care that aims to reduce the production of new protein but does not directly target and clear the toxic amyloid that deposits in organs. There are currently no approved treatments for AL amyloidosis that have demonstrated a survival benefit, and there is an urgent unmet medical need for therapies that improve survival in patients at risk for early mortality due to amyloid deposition.
Clinical Development Program for Birtamimab
Early Development 
Birtamimab reacts with a “cryptic” epitope that is exposed on misfolded kappa and lambda light chains that misfold and form amyloid. The epitope is well defined and highly conserved in light chains and exposed from early stages of aggregation throughout amyloid. Preclinical research has demonstrated that birtamimab binds to both soluble and insoluble aggregated kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chain by recognizing this epitope that is exposed at the earliest stages of abnormal light chain misfolding and through aggregation of deposited amyloid. Our extensive preclinical findings and publications describe two proposed mechanisms of action for birtamimab: binding and neutralization of soluble toxic light chain aggregates, and clearance of amyloid deposits by phagocytosis. 
In multiple clinical studies, birtamimab has been shown to be generally safe and well tolerated and has been evaluated in 302 patients receiving monthly intravenous infusions (including 294 patients who received the recommended 24 mg/kg dose), for an average of approximately 15 months. 
On December 12, 2022, we presented in an oral presentation at the 64th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition in New Orleans, Louisiana, data from the completed VITAL study demonstrating that in a post hoc analysis of patients with Mayo Stage IV AL amyloidosis, a statistically significant survival benefit was observed through 9-months for those treated with birtamimab. The survival benefit of birtamimab in VITAL remained consistent when adjusted for key baseline variables in patients with Mayo Stage IV AL amyloidosis.
Confirmatory Phase 3 AFFIRM-AL Study Design under SPA Agreement with the FDA
Based on further analyses of data from the VITAL study and multiple in-depth discussions with the FDA, Prothena announced plans on February 1, 2021, to advance birtamimab into the confirmatory Phase 3 AFFIRM-AL study in patients with Mayo Stage IV AL amyloidosis. AFFIRM-AL is a registration-enabling Phase 3 study that is being conducted with a primary endpoint of all-cause mortality at p<0.10 under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) agreement with the FDA. Topline data from AFFIRM-AL is expected in 2024.
AFFIRM-AL is an ongoing global, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2:1 randomized, time-to-event study expected to enroll approximately 150 newly diagnosed, treatment naïve patients with AL amyloidosis categorized as Mayo Stage IV. It has been designed to evaluate the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality with a significance level of p<0.10. 
Secondary endpoints will assess change from baseline to month 9 in quality of life as measured by SF-36v2 PCS and functional capacity as measured by 6MWT distance.
An interim analysis will be conducted when approximately 50% of the events have occurred, allowing the independent data monitoring committee to recommend either continuing the study or stopping early for overwhelming efficacy. Patients will receive 24 mg/kg of birtamimab or placebo by intravenous infusion every 28 days, with all patients receiving concurrent standard of care therapy consisting of a first line bortezomib-containing regimen.
Prasinezumab for the Potential Treatment of Parkinson’s Disease and Other Synucleinopathies
Prasinezumab is an investigational humanized monoclonal antibody that targets alpha-synuclein, a protein found in neurons that can aggregate and spread from cell to cell, resulting in the neuronal dysfunction and loss that causes Parkinson’s disease and other synucleinopathies. Prasinezumab is the focus of our worldwide collaboration with Roche.
The protein α-synuclein is found extensively in neurons and is a major component of pathological inclusions that characterize several neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy, which collectively are termed synucleinopathies. While the normal function of α-synuclein is not well understood, the protein normally occurs in a soluble form. In synucleinopathies, the α-synuclein protein can misfold and aggregate to form soluble aggregates and insoluble fibrils that contribute to the pathology of the disease.
There is genetic evidence for a causal role of α-synuclein in Parkinson’s disease. In rare cases of familial forms of Parkinson’s disease, there are mutations in the synuclein protein sequence, or duplication and triplications of the relevant gene leading to overproduction of α-synuclein, which may cause α-synuclein protein to aggregate and form amyloid-like fibrils that contribute to the disease. There is also increasing evidence that this disease-causing α-synuclein can be propagated and transmitted from neuron to neuron, resulting in a spreading of neuronal death. Recent studies in cellular and animal models suggest that the spread of α-synuclein-associated neurodegeneration can be disrupted by targeting aberrant forms of α-synuclein.
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive degenerative disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) that affects approximately one in 100 people over the age of 60, with incidence increasing based on an aging population. With an estimated 10 million people living with Parkinson’s disease worldwide today, it is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder and fastest growing neurological disorder. The disease is characterized by the neuronal accumulation of aggregated α-synuclein in the CNS and peripheral nervous system that results in a wide spectrum of worsening progressive motor and non-motor symptoms. While diagnosis currently relies on motor symptoms classically associated with Parkinson's disease, non-motor symptoms may present many years earlier. Current treatments for Parkinson’s disease are symptomatic and only address a subset of symptoms such as motor impairment, dementia or psychosis. Symptomatic therapies do not target the underlying cause of the disease and as the disease progresses and dopaminergic neurons continue to be lost, these drugs lose effectiveness, often leading to debilitating side effects as the disease progresses. There are currently no treatments available that target the underlying cause of the disease. Prasinezumab is designed to block the cell-to-cell transmission of the aggregated, pathogenic forms of alpha-synuclein in Parkinson's disease, thereby slowing clinical decline. The goal of our approach is to slow the progressive neurodegenerative consequences of disease, a current unmet need.
Clinical Development Program for Prasinezumab
Prior to initiating clinical trials, we tested the efficacy of prasinezumab in various cellular and animal models of α-synuclein-related disease. In transgenic mouse models of Parkinson’s disease, passive immunization with 9E4, the murine version of prasinezumab, reduced the appearance of α-synuclein pathology, protected synapses and improved performance by the mice in behavioral testing.
Phase 2b PADOVA Study 
A Phase 2b study (PADOVA) to further assess the efficacy of prasinezumab in an expanded patient population is being conducted by Roche. PADOVA is a Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of prasinezumab in patients with early Parkinson’s disease who are on stable symptomatic (levodopa) medication. The study intends to enroll 575 patients randomized to receive either prasinezumab or placebo via intravenous infusion every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint is time to meaningful progression on motor signs of the disease, as assessed by ≥5 point increase in Movement Disorder Society – Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III score from baseline. Topline data from PADOVA is expected in 2024.
Prasinezumab is the first anti-alpha synuclein antibody to advance into late-stage development. In March 2022, results from the analysis of part 2 of the Phase 2 PASADENA study of prasinezumab were presented in an oral presentation by Roche at the International Conference on Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Diseases (“AD/PD 2022”). Results showed that participants with Parkinson’s disease who were treated with prasinezumab for two years (early-start group) showed slower decline of MDS-UPDRS Part III scores relative to participants treated with placebo in the first year and prasinezumab in the second year (delayed-start group), further supporting a potential effect on delaying motor progression in patients. 
Phase 2 PASADENA Study
The results from the Phase 1 study further supported advancing prasinezumab into the Phase 2 PASADENA Study. PASADENA is a two-part Phase 2 clinical study in early Parkinson's disease patients that is being conducted by Roche. Part 1 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-arm study and enrolled 316 patients to evaluate the efficacy and safety of prasinezumab in patients over 52 weeks. In part 1, patients were randomized on a 1:1:1 basis to receive one of two active doses (1500 mg or depending on body weight either 3500 mg or 4500 mg) of prasinezumab or placebo via intravenous infusion once every 4 weeks. Patients enrolled in the study must not have been on dopaminergic therapy and were not be expected to require dopaminergic therapy for at least 52 weeks. Part 2 of the study was a 52-week blinded extension phase in which patients from the placebo arm of the study were re-randomized onto one of two active doses on a 1:1 basis, so that all participants were on active treatment. Patients who were originally randomized to an active dose will continued at that dose level for the additional 52 weeks. In part 2, patients were allowed to use concomitant dopaminergic therapy. Any patient who medically required initiation of dopaminergic therapy during part 1 had their subsequent data censored for the primary endpoint analysis.
Results from Part 1 of the PASADENA study were presented in a Top Abstract oral presentation at the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society’s MDS Virtual Conference 2020. While the study did not meet the primary objective, signals of efficacy on multiple pre-specified secondary and exploratory clinical endpoints, including measures of motor function and biomarkers, were demonstrated in both of the prasinezumab arms when compared to placebo. In the PASADENA study, prasinezumab significantly reduced decline in motor function by 35% (pooled dose levels) vs. placebo after one year of treatment on the centrally rated assessment of Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III, a clinical examination of motor function. Motor symptoms associated with Parkinson’s disease include slowness of movement (bradykinesia), tremor, rigidity, and gait. Prasinezumab-treated patients also demonstrated a significant delay in time to clinically meaningful worsening of motor progression on the site rated assessment of time to at least a 5-point progression on MDS-UPDRS Part III vs. placebo over one year, with a hazard ratio of 0.82 (pooled dose levels). The study was designed with 80% power and a one-sided alpha of 0.10 to detect a 37.5% relative between group reduction from baseline to week 52.
The primary endpoint of the study was the change from baseline in the MDS-UPDRS total score (Parts I, II and III) at 52 weeks in each treatment group vs. the placebo group (pooled dose levels: –14.0%, –1.30, 80% CI=(–3.18, 0.58), p=0.38; low dose level: –21.5%, –2.02, 80% CI=(–4.21, 0.18); and high dose level: –6.6%, –0.62, 80% CI=(–2.82, 1.58)). Signals of efficacy were observed on multiple pre-specified secondary and exploratory clinical endpoints including change from baseline in MDS-UPDRS Part III in prasinezumab-treated patients vs. placebo at 52 weeks by central rating (pooled dose levels: –35.0%, –1.88, 80% CI=(–3.31, –0.45), p=0.09; low dose level: –45.4%, –2.44, 80% CI=(–4.09, –0.78); and high dose level: –24.7%, –1.33, 80% CI=(–2.99, 0.34)) and by site rating (pooled dose levels: –25.0%, –1.44, 80% CI=(–2.83, –0.06), p=0.18; low dose level: –33.8%, –1.88, 80% CI=(–3.49, –0.27); and high dose level: –18.2%, –1.02, 80% CI=(–2.64, 0.61)). MDS-UPDRS Part III is a clinical examination of motor function that assesses motor symptoms associated with Parkinson’s disease. Prasinezumab also delayed time to clinically meaningful worsening of motor progression in prasinezumab-treated patients vs. placebo over 52 weeks as demonstrated by site rating of time to at least a 5-point progression in MDS-UPDRS Part III (pooled dose levels: HR=0.82, 80% CI=0.64 to 0.99, p=0.17; low dose level: HR=0.77, 80% CI=0.63 to 0.96; and high dose level: HR=0.87, CI=0.70 to 1.07).
Additional signals of efficacy on bradykinesia and, separately, a digital motor score developed by Roche using a novel smartphone technology further extended the results shown on MDS-UPDRS Part III. 
In an analysis of cerebral blood flow, assessed by changes in magnetic resonance-arterial spin labeling (MRI-ASL) in a subset of patients, prasinezumab-treated patients showed improvement in cerebral blood flow in the putamen, an area of the brain associated with the loss of dopaminergic terminals and presence of alpha-synuclein pathology in Parkinson’s disease, suggesting an impact on the underlying biology implicated in disease progression. 
Prasinezumab was found to be generally safe and well tolerated, with the majority of adverse events reported as mild or moderate and similar across placebo and both treatment arms. 
In October 2020, we announced that Roche and Prothena will advance prasinezumab into a late-stage Phase 2b study in patients with early Parkinson’s disease. The study is designed to further assess the efficacy of prasinezumab by expanding upon the patient population enrolled in PASADENA to include patients with early Parkinson’s disease on stable levodopa therapy. 
Prasinezumab is the first potentially disease-modifying, anti-alpha-synuclein antibody to demonstrate signals of efficacy on multiple pre-specified secondary and exploratory clinical endpoints in patients with early Parkinson’s disease and advance into late-stage development. 
Phase 1 Studies
During 2014, together with Roche, we advanced prasinezumab into clinical development with the initiation of two Phase 1 studies. Results of the first study, a Phase 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose trial demonstrated that prasinezumab was safe and well-tolerated in healthy volunteers, meeting the primary objective of the study. Results of the second study, a Phase 1b double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose study demonstrated an acceptable safety and tolerability profile at all dose levels tested in patients with Parkinson’s disease, meeting the primary objective of the study. CNS penetration was demonstrated by a dose-dependent increase in prasinezumab levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and a mean concentration of prasinezumab in CSF of 0.3% relative to serum across all dose levels, which exceeded our expectations based on our preclinical experience. Data from the study also demonstrated rapid, dose- and time-dependent mean reduction in levels of free serum α-synuclein of up to 97% after a single dose, which were statistically significant (p < 0.0001), and maintained following two additional monthly doses. 
In June 2018, we published results from the Phase 1b multiple ascending dose study of prasinezumab in patients with Parkinson’s disease in JAMA Neurology. The paper is entitled “Safety and Tolerability of Multiple Ascending Doses of PRX002/RG7935, an Anti-α-Synuclein Monoclonal Antibody, in Patients with Parkinson Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial.”
License, Development, and Commercialization Agreement with Roche
In December 2013, we entered into the License Agreement with Roche to develop and commercialize certain antibodies that target α-synuclein, including prasinezumab, which are referred to in this report collectively as “Licensed Products.” The License Agreement became effective on January 17, 2014, which triggered an upfront payment to us of $30.0 million from Roche, which we received in February 2014. In July 2017, we announced that the first patient had been enrolled in PASADENA, a global Phase 2 study of prasinezumab in patients with early Parkinson’s disease. The start of the Phase 2 PASADENA study triggered a $30.0 million milestone payment from Roche to Prothena, which was earned in the second quarter of 2017. In May 2021, we announced that the first patient had been enrolled in PADOVA, a global Phase 2b study of prasinezumab in patients with early Parkinson’s disease. The start of the Phase 2b PADOVA study triggered a $60.0 million  milestone payment from Roche to Prothena, which was earned in the second quarter of 2021. 
Pursuant to the License Agreement, we are collaborating with Roche to develop antibody products targeting α-synuclein. Roche is primarily responsible for developing, obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for, and commercializing Licensed Products under the collaboration, including prasinezumab. Roche is responsible for the clinical and commercial manufacture and supply of Licensed Products within a defined time period following the effective date of the License Agreement.
We have so far earned $135 million of a total $755 million in potential clinical, regulatory and sales milestones. In addition to the $30.0 million upfront payment and clinical milestone payment of $15.0 million (both in 2014), the clinical milestone payment of $30.0 million in 2017, and the clinical milestone payment of $60 million in 2021, Roche is also obligated to pay:
•up to $290.0 million upon the achievement of additional development, regulatory and various first commercial sales milestones;
•up to $155.0 million upon the achievement of U.S. commercial sales milestones;
•up to $175.0 million upon achievement of ex-U.S. commercial sales milestones; and
•tiered, high single-digit to high double-digit royalties in the teens based on U.S. and ex-U.S. annual net sales, subject to certain adjustments, with respect to the applicable Licensed Product.
Roche bore 100% of the cost of conducting the research collaboration under the License Agreement during the research term, which expired December 31, 2017. In May 2021, the Company exercised its rights under the terms of License Agreement to receive potential U.S. commercial sales milestone and royalties, in lieu of a U.S. profit and loss share for prasinezumab in 
Parkinson’s disease. Thus in the U.S. through May 28, 2021, the parties shared all development costs, all of which were allocated 70% to Roche and 30% to the Company, for prasinezumab in the Parkinson’s disease indication. If the Company opts in to participate in co-development and co-funding for any other Licensed Products and/or indications, the parties will share all development and commercialization costs, as well as profits, all of which will be allocated 70% to Roche and 30% to the Company. In addition, we have an option under the License Agreement to co-promote prasinezumab in the U.S. in the Parkinson’s disease indication. If we exercise such option, we may also elect to co-promote additional licensed products in the U.S. approved for Parkinson’s disease or other indications calling on the same prescriber. Outside the U.S., Roche has responsibility for developing and commercializing the licensed products.
Under the License Agreement with Roche, we granted to Roche an exclusive, worldwide license to develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import and export the Licensed Products. The License Agreement continues on a country-by-country basis until the expiration of all payment obligations thereunder. The License Agreement may also be terminated (i) by Roche at will after the first anniversary of the effective date of the License Agreement, either in its entirety or on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product basis, upon 90 days’ prior written notice to us prior to first commercial sale and 180 days’ prior written notice to us after first commercial sale, (ii) by either party, either in its entirety or on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product or region-by-region basis, upon written notice in connection with a material breach uncured 90 days after initial written notice, and (iii) by either party, in its entirety, upon insolvency of the other party. The License Agreement may be terminated by either party on a patent-by-patent and country-by-country basis if the other party challenges a given patent in a given country. Our rights to co-develop licensed products under the License Agreement will terminate if we commence certain studies for certain types of competitive products. Our rights to co-promote licensed products under the License Agreement will terminate if we commence a Phase 3 study for such competitive products.
NNC6019 (formerly PRX004) for the Potential Treatment of ATTR Amyloidosis
NNC6019 (formerly PRX004) is an investigational antibody designed to deplete amyloid associated with disease pathology in hereditary and wild type ATTR amyloidosis, without affecting the native, normal tetrameric form of the protein.
ATTR amyloidosis is a rare, progressive and fatal disease characterized by deposition of abnormal, non-native forms of TTR protein (amyloid) in vital organs. ATTR amyloidosis can be hereditary (hATTR) when caused by a mutation in the TTR gene, or wild-type (wtATTR) when it occurs sporadically. In both forms of the disease, patients can experience a spectrum of clinical manifestations due to deposition of amyloid that can affect multiple organs, most commonly the heart and/or nervous system. The TTR protein is produced primarily in the liver and in its normal tetrameric form serves as a carrier for thyroxin and retinol binding protein (a transporter for vitamin A) and is also implicated in neuroprotective functions. 
Wild-type ATTR (wtATTR) occurs sporadically and primarily involves cardiomyopathy. It is estimated that between 400,000 to 1.4 million patients suffer from ATTR-cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM). Within this population, between 130,000 to 490,000 patients are estimated to be moderate-to-advanced and categorized as New York Heart Association Class III and IV. 
In hereditary ATTR amyloidosis, mutations in the TTR gene causes non-native TTR to accumulate and damage body organs and tissue, such as the peripheral nerves and heart. This results in predominant symptoms of neuropathy (hATTR-PN) and/or cardiomyopathy (hATTR-CM), as well as other disease manifestations. It is estimated that there are approximately 50,000 patients with hATTR worldwide, with approximately 10,000 characterized as hATTR-PN and 40,000 characterized as hATTR-CM.
It is generally accepted that, at the time of diagnosis, affected organs in ATTR amyloidosis patients (both hATTR and wtATTR amyloidosis) contain extracellular amyloid deposits. These deposits, together with prefibrillar species, are believed to cause organ dysfunction and failure. 
Current therapeutic approaches for ATTR amyloidosis have demonstrated benefit to patients by impacting the biological pathway leading to the formation of amyloid deposits. These approaches are designed to either reduce production of native forms of the TTR protein or bind to TTR and prevent tetramer dissociation but do not target the non-native, pathogenic form of TTR directly.
NNC6019’s proposed mechanism of action is to deplete both circulating non-native TTR to prevent further deposition and deposited amyloid to improve organ function. NNC6019 has been shown in preclinical studies to inhibit amyloid fibril formation, neutralize soluble aggregate forms of non-native TTR, and promote clearance of insoluble amyloid fibrils through antibody-mediated phagocytosis. This differentiated depleter mechanism of action could be developed as a monotherapy 
approach to ATTR amyloidosis and might also complement existing therapeutic approaches which either stabilize or reduce production of the native TTR tetramer.
We completed a Phase 1 study with NNC6019 in patients with hereditary forms of ATTR amyloidosis, in which NNC6019 was demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated.
ATTR Amyloidosis Business Acquired by Novo Nordisk
On July 12, 2021, we announced that we and Novo Nordisk entered into a definitive purchase agreement under which Novo Nordisk acquired our clinical stage antibody NNC6019 (formerly PRX004) and broader ATTR amyloidosis business. 
Under the terms of the definitive purchase agreement, Novo Nordisk acquired our wholly-owned subsidiary and gained full worldwide rights to the intellectual property and related rights of our ATTR amyloidosis business and pipeline. The aggregate purchase price consists of an upfront payment  and development and sales milestone payments totaling up to $1.23 billion. We have earned approximately $100 million to date, including a $40 million clinical milestone payment that we announced on November 21, 2022.
A Phase 2 study of NNC6019 in patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy is being conducted by Novo Nordisk (NCT05442047). Topline data is expected in 2024.
PRX005 for the Potential Treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease 
PRX005 is designed to be a best-in-class anti-tau antibody that specifically binds with high affinity the R1, R2, and R3 repeats within the microtubule binding region (“MTBR”) of tau and targets both 3R and 4R tau isoforms. MTBR-tau has been shown in preclinical studies to be involved in the pathological spread of tau. Neurofibrillary tangles composed of misfolded tau proteins, along with amyloid beta plaques, are pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease. Cell-to-cell transmission of pathogenic extracellular tau and the accumulation of pathogenic tau also correlate with the progression of symptomatology and clinical decline in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Recent publications suggest that during the course of Alzheimer’s disease progression, tau appears to spread throughout the brain via synaptically-connected pathways; this propagation of pathology is thought to be mediated by tau “seeds” containing the MTBR of tau. Additionally, it has been recently reported that the presence of MTBR fragments in cerebrospinal fluid correlate with dementia stages and tau tangles in Alzheimer’s disease to a higher degree than fragments of other tau regions. In preclinical research, antibodies targeting this region of tau were superior in blocking tau uptake and neurotoxicity, which has been associated with efficacy in relevant animal models. In these preclinical models, PRX005 demonstrated significant reduction of intraneuronal tau pathology and progression protection against behavioral deficit in a tau transgenic mouse model and complete blockade of neuronal tau internalization in vitro. 
In June 2021, we announced that BMS exercised its option under the global neuroscience research and development collaboration to enter into an exclusive U.S. license for PRX005. BMS paid Prothena $80 million for this option following the execution of a US License Agreement for PRX005 and transfer of the underlying license. 
Phase 1 Studies
In this first-in-human, randomized, placebo controlled, single ascending dose (SAD) study, healthy volunteers (n=19) were enrolled into three PRX005 dose level cohorts (low, medium or high dose) and randomized in a 3:1 drug to placebo ratio. Study participants received a single dose of PRX0005 or placebo intravenously (IV) and were followed for up to two months. The results of the study found all three dose level cohorts of PRX005 to be generally safe and well tolerated, meeting the Phase 1 SAD study primary objective. None of the treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) were serious. No clinically relevant changes were observed in other safety parameters. PRX005 also met key pharmacokinetic (PK) and immunogenicity secondary endpoints. Plasma drug concentrations of PRX005 increased in a dose-proportional manner. Furthermore, PRX005 exposure in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was measured in the high dose cohort and based on the robust exposure of PRX005 in the CSF (day 29 CSF:Plasma ratio=0.2%), substantial target engagement is expected in the CNS. PRX005 had a desirable immunogenicity profile with no persistent PRX005-induced antidrug antibodies (ADAs) observed. A multiple ascending dose portion of the Phase 1 study is ongoing. Topline data from the Phase 1 study is expected in 2023.
Global Neuroscience Research and Development Collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb 
This global neuroscience research and development collaboration is focused on three proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, including tau, TDP-43, and an undisclosed target. PRX005 is designed to 
be a best-in-class anti-tau, MTBR-specific antibody for the potential treatment of AD and, with the initiation of the Phase 1 study, is the first program to advance to the clinic from this collaboration. After receiving the $80 million payment described above, we have received a total of $230 million pursuant to the collaboration and we are eligible to receive up to an additional $160 million for U.S. rights, up to $165 million for global rights, and up to $1.7 billion for regulatory and commercial milestone payments for a total of up to $2.2 billion plus potential tiered commercial sales royalties across multiple programs. 
In March 2018, we entered into the Master Collaboration Agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with Celgene (which was acquired by BMS in November 2019), under which Celgene (now BMS) may elect in its sole discretion to exclusively license rights to develop and commercialize antibodies targeting tau, TDP-43 and an undisclosed target. The Collaboration Agreement became effective on March 20, 2018, which triggered an upfront payment to us of $100 million, as well as a further payment of approximately $50 million to subscribe for 1,174,536 of the Company’s ordinary shares at a price of $42.57 per share, pursuant to a Share Subscription Agreement (the “SSA”) as described further below.
In June 2021, we announced that BMS exercised its option under the global neuroscience research and development collaboration to enter into an exclusive U.S. license for PRX005. BMS paid Prothena $80.0 million following the execution of a US License Agreement for PRX005 and transfer of the underlying license. 
On a program-by-program basis, following Prothena’s filing of an investigational new drug application (IND) for the additional two collaboration programs, BMS may elect in its sole discretion to exercise its right to receive an exclusive license to develop and commercialize antibodies targeting the applicable Collaboration Target in the U.S. (the “US Rights”). If BMS exercises the US Rights for a collaboration program, it is obligated to pay Prothena an exercise fee of approximately $80 million per program. Thereafter, BMS would have decision making authority over development activities, and all regulatory, manufacturing and commercialization activities, for antibody products targeting the relevant Collaboration Target (the “Collaboration Products”) in the U.S.
On a program-by-program basis, following completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial for a collaboration program for which BMS has previously exercised its US Rights, BMS may elect in its sole discretion to exercise its right with respect to such collaboration program to receive a worldwide, exclusive license to develop and commercialize antibodies targeting the applicable Collaboration Target (the “Global Rights”). If BMS exercises its Global Rights, BMS would be obligated to pay Prothena an additional exercise fee of $55 million for such collaboration program. The Global Rights would then replace the US Rights for that collaboration program, and BMS would have decision making authority over developing, obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for, manufacturing and commercializing the Collaboration Products worldwide.
After exercise of Global Rights for a collaboration program, Prothena is eligible to receive up to $562.5 million in regulatory and commercial milestones per program. For obtaining either US Rights or Global Rights for such collaboration program, Prothena will also be eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales of Collaboration Products ranging from high single digit to high teen percentages, on a weighted average basis depending on the achieving of certain net sales thresholds. Such exercise fees, milestones and royalty payments are subject to certain reductions as specified in the Collaboration Agreement, the agreement for US Rights and the agreement for Global Rights.
BMS will continue to pay royalties on a Collaboration Product-by-Collaboration Product and country-by-country basis, until the latest of (i) expiration of certain patents covering the Collaboration Product, (ii) expiration of all regulatory exclusivity for the Collaboration Product, and (iii) an agreed period of time after the first commercial sale of the Collaboration Product in the applicable country (the “Royalty Term”).
The research term under the Collaboration Agreement continues for a period of six (6) years, which BMS may extend for up to two additional 12-month periods by paying an extension fee of $10 million per extension period. The term of Collaboration Agreement continues until the last to occur of the following: (i) expiration of the research term, (ii) expiration of all US Rights terms, and (iii) expiration of all Global Rights terms.
The term of any agreement for US Rights or Global Rights would continue on a Collaboration Product-by-Collaboration Product and country-by-country basis until the expiration of all Royalty Terms under such agreement.
The Collaboration Agreement may be terminated (i) by either party on a program-by-program basis if the other party remains in material breach of the Collaboration Agreement following a cure period to remedy the material breach, (ii) by BMS at will on a program-by-program basis or in its entirety, (iii) by either party, in its entirety, upon insolvency of the other party, or (iv) by Prothena, in its entirety, if BMS challenges a patent licensed by Prothena to BMS under the Collaboration Agreement.
Under the SSA, BMS is subject to certain transfer and standstill restrictions, including a restriction on acquiring more than 9.9% of the Company’s share capital for a specified period of time following the closing of the subscription of 1,174,536 of the Company’s ordinary shares (Shares), or earlier upon announcement of the intent to consummate a change of control of the Company by the Company or a third party, or expiration or termination of the Collaboration Agreement. In addition, BMS will be entitled to request the registration of the Shares on Form S-3ASR or Form S-3 following termination of the transfer restrictions if the Shares cannot be resold without restriction pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
PRX012 for the Potential Treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease
PRX012 is an investigational antibody that targets Aβ, or Amyloid Beta, a protein implicated in Alzheimer’s disease. Our scientists have advanced the understanding of the biology of Alzheimer’s disease and made particularly impactful and fundamental discoveries that elucidated the role amyloid plays in the disease. 
Monoclonal antibodies targeting key epitopes within the N-terminus of Aβ have demonstrated that reducing amyloid plaque burden is associated with the slowing of clinical decline in Alzheimer’s disease. To address the growing prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease with a therapeutic that can be made widely accessible to patients, we have developed highly potent anti-Aβ antibodies that retain or improve key attributes that are thought to underlie the observed efficacy of N-terminally directed therapeutics such as aducanumab, with the aim of offering similar or improved efficacy with convenient subcutaneous dosing regimens. In preclinical studies, our antibodies demonstrated a higher binding strength to amyloid than aducanumab; specifically, our lead candidate with an approximately 10-fold greater affinity/avidity for fibrillar Aβ than aducanumab that also neutralized soluble, toxic (i.e., oligomeric) Aβ species. Preclinical studies also showed that our antibodies recognize Aβ pathology to a greater extent than aducanumab, demonstrating more extensive plaque area binding at lower antibody concentrations, which are estimated to be clinically relevant exposures in the central nervous system following systemic dosing.
We are advancing our lead candidate, PRX012, as a next-generation approach for subcutaneous administration to improve access for patients with Alzheimer’s disease. In March 2022, we announced the FDA clearance of the IND for PRX012 and the initiation of a Phase 1 single ascending dose study to investigate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetics of PRX012 in both healthy volunteers and patients with Alzheimer’s disease. In April 2022, we announced that the FDA granted Fast Track designation for PRX012 for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. The FDA’s Fast Track designation program is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs intended to treat a serious condition, such as Alzheimer’s disease, with evidence demonstrating the potential to address an unmet medical need. A multiple ascending dose portion of the Phase 1 study is ongoing. Topline data from the Phase 1 study is expected in 2023.
Our Discovery and Preclinical Programs
We are also advancing several discovery and preclinical-stage programs for neurological diseases with significant unmet medical needs such as Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Our discovery and pre-clinical pipeline includes our proprietary dual Aβ-tau vaccine program, as well as two programs (TDP-43 and an undisclosed target (PRX019)) that are the focus of our collaboration with BMS. 
If promising, we expect to advance our discovery programs into preclinical development. New target discovery will focus on areas where we can bring potential new therapies to patients expeditiously through our internal expertise and resources. Existing late discovery-stage or preclinical-stage programs may be partnered or out-licensed. 
PRX123, a Dual Aβ-Tau Vaccine for the Potential Treatment and Prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease 
We are developing a dual vaccine, PRX123, which concomitantly targets key epitopes within both the Aβ and tau proteins. Preclinical models suggest that Aβ and tau act synergistically in the development of Alzheimer’s disease; however, the majority of vaccines and passive immunotherapies under development today target only one of these two pathological features. 
PRX123 is being developed for the potential prevention and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. In preclinical studies, PRX123 has generated polyclonal responses against key epitopes within the N-terminal of Aβ and a key region of tau to promote amyloid clearance and blockade of tau transmission. Immunohistochemistry using sera from immunized animals demonstrated an appropriate and balanced immune response with antibodies that react to both Aβ plaques and tau tangles at concentrations expected to be reached in CNS following immunization and resultant titer generation. 
In March 2022, we delivered an oral presentation at AD/PD 2022 on preclinical data demonstrating that PRX123 generated anti-Aβ and anti-tau antibodies to enable phagocytosis of Aβ and to neutralize tau. These findings provided proof of concept in multiple preclinical species. We expect to file an IND for PRX123 with the FDA in 2023.
Regulation 
We anticipate that if we commercialize any products, the U.S. market will ultimately be our most important market. For this reason, the laws and regulations discussed below focus on the requirements applicable to biologic products in the U.S.
Government Regulation
Governmental authorities, including the FDA, the EMA and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries, regulate the development, testing, use, labeling, manufacturing, storage, record-keeping, reporting, marketing, advertising, promotion, tracking and tracing of pharmaceutical and biological products. The FDA does so under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations and guidance for industry, and the U.S. Public Health Service Act and its implementing regulations. Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in warning and untitled letters, civil and criminal fines and other judicially imposed sanctions, including product seizures, import restrictions, injunctive actions and criminal prosecutions of both companies and individuals. In addition, administrative remedies can involve requests to recall violative products, the refusal of the government to enter into supply contracts; or the refusal to approve pending applications for product approval until manufacturing or other alleged deficiencies are brought into compliance. The FDA and other comparable regulatory authorities also have the authority to cause the withdrawal of approval of a marketed product or to impose additional labeling or distribution restrictions.
The pricing of pharmaceutical and biological products is regulated in many countries and the mechanism of price regulation varies. In the U.S., while there are limited indirect federal government price controls over private sector purchases of drugs, it is not possible to predict future regulatory action or private sector initiatives on the pricing of pharmaceutical products.
Product Approval
United States. In the U.S., our current drug candidates are regulated as biological products, or biologics. The FDA regulates biologics under the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act, the Public Health Service Act and their implementing regulations. Biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves, and is not limited to, the following:
•completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies, performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the efficacy and safety of the product for each proposed indication, all performed in accordance with FDA’s current good clinical practices (“cGCP”) requirements;
•completion of chemistry, manufacturing and control (“CMC”) processes and procedures to establish the safety and quality of the product in accordance with FDA’s current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) regulations;
•submission to the FDA of a Biological License Application (“BLA”) for a new biologic, after completion of all required clinical trials;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is produced and tested to assess compliance with regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations; 
•referral of the BLA to an advisory committee for review, if deemed necessary; and
•FDA review and approval of a BLA for a new biologic, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the U.S.
Nonclinical tests assess the potential safety and pharmacologic effects of a product candidate in in vitro and/or in vivo studies. The results of these studies must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND before human testing may proceed. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to manufacture and administer an investigational drug or biologic product to 
humans. The IND includes the proposed protocol(s) and general investigational plan for human studies. The IND also includes results of nonclinical studies and other human studies, as appropriate, as well as manufacturing information, analytical data and any other available data or literature to support the use of the investigational new drug. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may be initiated. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises full or partial concerns or questions related to initiation of the proposed clinical trial(s). In such a case, the IND may be placed on a full or partial clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial(s) may begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing a clinical trial(s) to commence as planned.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with cGCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent prior to their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site’s Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) before the trials may be initiated, and the IRB must provide oversight of the trials until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
The clinical investigation of a pharmaceutical, including a biologic, is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The three phases of an investigation are as follows:
•Phase 1. Phase 1 includes the initial introduction of an investigational product into humans. Phase 1 clinical trials are typically more closely monitored and may be conducted in patients with the target disease or condition or in healthy volunteers. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, appropriate dosage, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational product’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. The total number of participants included in Phase 1 clinical trials varies, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80;
•Phase 2. Phase 2 includes controlled clinical trials conducted to preliminarily or further evaluate the efficacy and safety of the investigational product for a specific indication(s) in patients with the disease or condition under study, to determine dosage(s) for further studies, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the product. Phase 2 clinical trials are typically well-controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a patient population, usually involving no more than several hundred participants; and
•Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are generally well controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded patient population generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness and safety of the product has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate efficacy and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. Phase 3 clinical trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand participants.
The clinical trial process can take many years to complete, and there can be no assurance that the data collected will support FDA approval of the product. During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring of clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA may place clinical trials on hold at any point in this process if, among other reasons, it concludes that clinical subjects are being exposed to an unreasonable and significant health risk or illness or injury. Trials may also be terminated by IRBs, which must review and approve all research involving human subjects. Side effects or adverse events that are reported during clinical trials can delay, impede or prevent further clinical testing and/or marketing authorization.
Information including the results of the nonclinical and clinical testing, and the chemistry, manufacturing and controls of the product are evaluated and, if determined to be adequate, submitted to the FDA to support the proposed product labeling through a BLA. The application includes all relevant data available from nonclinical and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other required information. Data from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the efficacy and safety of a proposed use of a product, and/or from alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators may be included in a BLA.
Once the BLA submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review applications within ten months from the 60 day filing date for Standard Review (for a total of twelve months) or, in the case of Priority Review, six months from the 60 day-filing date (for a total of eight months). 
The review process often may be significantly extended by the FDA’s requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective, which includes determining whether it is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations.
In certain cases, the FDA may issue a SPA, which is a written agreement between a sponsor and the FDA that indicates concurrence between the parties regarding the adequacy and acceptability of specific design elements and planned analysis for a clinical trial intended to form the basis of a licensing application. An SPA does not indicate FDA concurrence on every detail in a particular trial protocol, and final marketing approval depends upon factors including the efficacy and safety results from the trial, the overall safety profile and an evaluation of the benefit/risk profile for the product candidate as demonstrated across clinical trials for the target patient population. 
The FDA has four expedited program designations for serious conditions - Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Accelerated Approval and Priority Review - to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical needs or provide substantial improvements in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions. 
The Fast Track designation provides pharmaceutical manufacturers with opportunities for frequent interactions with FDA during the product’s development and for a rolling review of the BLA. A rolling review allows for completed portions of the application to be submitted and reviewed by the FDA prior to submission of the complete application. 
The Breakthrough Therapy designation provides sponsors with all of the features of Fast Track designation as well as intensive guidance on implementing an efficient development program for the product and a commitment by the FDA to involve senior managers and experienced review staff in the review. This FDA designation requires preliminary clinical evidence that a product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition, alone or in combination with other drugs or biologics, demonstrates substantial improvement over currently available therapy on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. 
FDA may grant Accelerated Approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening condition, upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate or intermediate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA has required the sponsor to conduct post-approval confirmatory trials to verify the clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA requires pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
After the FDA evaluates the BLA and conducts pre-approval inspections of manufacturing facilities where the candidate product and/or its active pharmaceutical ingredient will be produced, of clinical sites and of the sponsor, if deemed necessary, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific labeling for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. 
The FDA may also require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) plan as a condition of approval to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. A REMS or a separate medication guide, if required, must be submitted to the FDA for review and approval.
The FDA also may impose other conditions for approval including but not limited to, changes to proposed labeling, changes to manufacturing controls and specifications, or a commitment or requirement to conduct one or more post-marketing studies or additional clinical trials. Such post-marketing commitments or requirements may include Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
European Union. In the EU, there are several pathways for marketing approval, depending on the type of product for which approval is sought. Under the centralized procedure, a sponsor submits a single application to the EMA. The marketing application is similar to the BLA submitted to FDA in the U.S. and is evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (the “CHMP”), the expert scientific committee of the EMA. If the CHMP determines that the marketing application fulfills the requirements for efficacy, safety and quality (equivalent to chemistry, manufacturing and controls in the US), it will submit a favorable opinion to the European Commission (the “EC”). The CHMP opinion is not binding, but is typically adopted by the EC. A marketing application approved by the EC is valid in all EU member states.
In addition to the centralized procedure, the EU also has: (i) national authorization procedures, which requires a separate application in and approval determination by each country; (ii) a decentralized procedure, whereby applicants submit identical applications to several countries and receive simultaneous approval; and (iii) a mutual recognition procedure, where applicants submit an application to one country for review and approval, and other countries may accept or reject the decision in the initial country. Regardless of the approval process employed, various regulatory authorities share responsibilities for the monitoring, detection, and evaluation of adverse events post-approval, including national authorities, the EMA, the EC, and the marketing authorization holder.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed by us or on our behalf pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including requirements for record-keeping, reporting of adverse events, and submitting product deviation reports to notify the FDA of unanticipated changes in distributed products. Additionally, any significant change in the approved product or in how it is manufactured, including changes in formulation or the site of manufacture, generally require prior FDA approval of a supplemental BLA. The packaging and labeling of all products developed by us are also subject to FDA approval and ongoing regulation and oversight.
Sponsors are required to register their facilities with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP standards, which impose, among other things, certain quality processes, manufacturing controls and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers in order to ensure that the product is safe, and has the identity, strength, quality, purity and potency characteristics that it purports to have. Certain states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Noncompliance with cGMP or other requirements can result in issuance of warning or untitled letters, civil and criminal penalties, seizures, and injunctive action, as well as FDA not approving pending supplemental applications or withdrawing prior approvals, and product recalls.
FDA regulations also require, among other things, investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers and sponsors must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
The FDA and other federal and state agencies closely regulate the labeling, marketing and promotion of drugs. While doctors are free to prescribe any product approved by the FDA for any use, a company can only make claims relating to safety and efficacy of a product that are consistent with the FDA approved labeling, and the company is allowed to market a drug only for the particular use(s) approved by the FDA. In addition, any claims we make for our products in advertising or promotion must be appropriately balanced with important safety information and otherwise be adequately substantiated. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning or untitled letters, corrective advertising, injunctions, potential civil and criminal penalties, criminal prosecution, and agreements with governmental agencies that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. Government regulators, including the Department of Justice and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities, have increased their scrutiny of the promotion and marketing of drugs.
The FDA also enforces the requirements of the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act, which, among other things, imposes various requirements in connection with the distribution of product samples to physicians. Sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute, the U.S. False Claims Act, and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. We may also be subject to the U.S. Physician Payment Sunshine Act (the “Sunshine Act”) which regulates disclosure of payments to healthcare professionals and providers.
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), the Irish Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018 (the “Irish Corruption Act”) and the U.K. Bribery Act prohibit companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to governmental officials (and certain private individuals under the Irish Corruption Act and the U.K. Bribery Act) for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad. In many countries, the healthcare professionals we interact with may meet the definition of a government official for purposes of the FCPA. Failure to comply with domestic or non-domestic laws could result in various adverse consequences, including possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures, withdrawal of an approved product from the market, the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions and the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations.
Orphan Drugs
Under the U.S. Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. In the U.S., orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user fee waivers. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, except in limited circumstances, such as demonstration of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or if FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. As a result, even if one of our drug candidates receives orphan exclusivity, the FDA can still approve other drugs that have a different active ingredient for use in treating the same indication or disease. In addition, another company may obtain orphan exclusivity for the same drug for the same use before we do, which would block FDA from approving our product until the end of the exclusivity period unless we can demonstrate clinical superiority or the first-approved company is unable to assure supply. Furthermore, the FDA can waive orphan exclusivity if we are unable to manufacture sufficient supply of our product.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and other government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products, drugs and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and other governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost- containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our drug candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our drug candidates could reduce physician usage of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
Other Healthcare Laws
Although we currently do not have any products on the market, if our drug candidates are approved and we begin commercialization, we may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and other jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
Intellectual Property
We seek to protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property that we believe is important to our business, including by seeking, maintaining and defending patents. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how to protect our business. We may seek licenses from others as appropriate to enhance or maintain our competitive position.
Our intellectual property is primarily directed to therapeutic product candidates and related methods for the treatment of diseases that involve protein dysregulation, amyloidosis, or neurodegeneration, and other proprietary technologies and processes related to our lead product development candidates.
We own or hold exclusive licenses to a number of issued patents and pending patent applications in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, including Patent Cooperation Treaty applications. As of December 31, 2022, our patent portfolio included the following families of patents or patent applications that we own or have exclusively licensed from other parties:
•Approximately 8 patent families related to AL or AA amyloidosis, including our birtamimab program, including a composition of matter patent anticipated to expire 2029 (subject to potential adjustments in patent term as described below);
•Approximately 16 patent families related to Parkinson’s disease and other synucleinopathies, including our prasinezumab program, including a composition of matter patent anticipated to expire in 2032 (subject to potential adjustments in patent term as described below);
•Approximately 10 patent families related to passive immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease, including our PRX005 and PRX012 programs; and
•Approximately 17 patent families related to other potential targets of intervention and diseases, including PRX019, and other product candidates including vaccines.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. In the U.S., a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent.
The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during diligent clinical development and the FDA regulatory review process, which together are the regulatory review period. The U.S. Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under a regulatory review period. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent can be extended for each first regulatory review period for a product. Moreover, a patent can only be extended once, and thus, if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a BLA or NDA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use.
University of Tennessee License Agreement: Under a License Agreement with the University of Tennessee Research Foundation, we have exclusively licensed from the University of Tennessee its joint ownership interest in certain patents jointly owned with us. Those patents relate to our program targeting amyloidosis (birtamimab). Under that sublicensable, worldwide license, we are required to pay to the University of Tennessee an amount equal to 1% of net sales of any product covered by any licensed patent, plus certain additional payments in the event that all or a portion of the license is sublicensed. To date, we have not paid or incurred any royalties to the University of Tennessee under our agreement. The agreement is effective on a country-by-country basis for the longer of (i) a period of twenty years from the effective date of the agreement, or (ii) in each country in which a valid claim for any licensed patent or patent application exists, expiration of such valid claim. The agreement will terminate prior to the end of its term if we become insolvent unless the University of Tennessee elects to allow the agreement to remain in effect. The University of Tennessee may terminate the agreement prior to the end of its term upon our failure to make payment under the agreement within 120 days of notice of such failure or upon our material breach of the agreement, which breach has not been cured within 60 days of written notice of such breach. We may terminate the agreement prior to the end of its term if we have paid all amounts due to the University of Tennessee through the effective date of the termination and provide three months’ written notice to the University of Tennessee or upon material breach of the agreement by the University of Tennessee, which breach has not been cured within 60 days of written notice of such breach.
University of California License Agreement: Under a License Agreement with The Regents of the University of California, we have exclusively licensed from the University of California its joint ownership interest in certain patents jointly 
owned with us. Those patents relate to our program targeting Parkinson’s disease and other synucleinopathies (prasinezumab). Under that sublicensable, worldwide license, we are required to pay to the University of California an amount equal to 1% of net sales of any product covered by any licensed patent, plus certain additional payments for milestones achieved and sublicense revenue. To date, we have not paid or incurred any royalties to the University of California under our agreement. The agreement is effective until the expiration date of the last to expire licensed patent. The obligation to pay royalties continues on a country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last to expire patent containing a valid claim covering the applicable product. The agreement will terminate prior to the end of its term without prior written notice if (i) we, or third parties on our behalf or at our written urging, file a claim including an assertion that any portion of the licensed patents is invalid or unenforceable, or (ii) upon the filing of a petition for relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code by or against us as a debtor or alleged debtor. The University of California may terminate the agreement prior to the end of its term upon our default, if we fail to cure the default within 60 days of written notice of such default. We may terminate the agreement prior to the end of its term upon a 90 day written notice to the University of California.
Elan License Agreement: Under an Amended and Restated Intellectual Property License and Contribution Agreement with Elan and certain of its affiliates, we have exclusively licensed from Elan and those affiliates certain patents and patent applications owned by them, and exclusively sublicensed from Elan and those affiliates certain patents and patent applications owned by Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy. Those licenses are worldwide, fully paid, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable, and relate to our program targeting α-synuclein. Subsequent to entering into this Agreement, Elan was acquired by Perrigo Company plc. 
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors consist of major international companies, all of which are larger and have greater financial resources, technical staff, manufacturing, R&D and marketing capabilities than we have. We also compete with smaller research companies and generic drug and biosimilar manufacturers. The degree of competition varies for each of our programs.
A drug may be subject to competition from alternative therapies during the period of patent protection or regulatory exclusivity and thereafter it may be subject to further competition from generic products or biosimilars. Governmental and other pressures toward the dispensing of generic products or biosimilars may rapidly and significantly reduce, slow or reverse the growth, sales and profitability of any product not protected by patents or regulatory exclusivity, and may adversely affect our future results and financial condition. If we successfully discover, develop and commercialize any products, the launch of competitive products, including generic or biosimilar versions of any such products, may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.
Our competitive position depends in part upon our ability to discover and develop innovative and cost-effective new products. If we fail to discover and develop new products, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.
Manufacturing 
Prasinezumab - Boehringer Ingelheim Biopharmaceuticals GmbH (“BI”) manufactured clinical supplies of our drug candidate prasinezumab for our completed Phase 1a single ascending dose and Phase 1b multiple ascending dose clinical trials. Roche, with whom we are collaborating on development of prasinezumab, is manufacturing clinical supplies for the ongoing Phase 2 and any subsequent clinical trials for prasinezumab. We are dependent on Roche to manufacture these clinical supplies.
NNC6019 (formerly PRX004) - Rentschler Biopharma SE (“Rentschler”) manufactured clinical supplies of our drug candidate NNC6019 for our completed Phase 1 clinical trial.

Research and Development
Our research and development expenses totaled $135.6 million, $82.3 million, and $74.9 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. For more information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Employees and Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2022, we had 127 employees, including 19 holding M.D. and/or Ph.D. degrees. Of our employees, 92 were engaged in research and development activities and the remainder were working in general and administrative areas. 
To attract and retain qualified employees, we offer a total rewards package consisting of base salary and cash target bonus, a comprehensive benefit and wellness package, and equity compensation for every employee. An objective of our equity incentive program has been, and continues to be, to align the interests of equity incentive plan participants with those of our shareholders. We benchmark and survey the market to ensure we maintain competitive compensation and benefits programs for our employees. We believe in a geographically-diverse workforce to ensure we can hire the best talent where they are located.
Our human capital management strategy also embraces diversity, equity, and inclusion. As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 63% women and 37% men, and approximately 45% of our employees are racially or ethnically diverse. Our executive team, including employees at or above the vice president level, includes approximately 45% women, and approximately 28% who are racially or ethnically diverse. These figures were estimated by our human resources department.
The well-being, health, and safety of our employees are integral to the success of our business. We utilize numerous policies and strategies to ensure a safe workplace and laboratory environment, and also provide programs for employee wellness. In addition, specifically in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented masking and social distancing policies, and other safety measures at our facilities. Additionally, because we enabled remote working arrangements, we have efforts focused on engagement and integration of our existing and new employees. 
Our Board of Directors has delegated to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee the responsibility to oversee and monitor our strategies and policies related to human capital management within our workforce, including with respect to policies on diversity, equity, and inclusion; workplace environment and safety; and corporate culture.
