Overview
Q2 is a leading provider of secure, cloud-based digital solutions that transform the ways in which traditional and emerging financial services providers engage with account holders and end users, or End Users. We sell our solutions to regional and community financial institutions, or RCFIs, alternative finance and leasing companies, or Alt-FIs, and financial technology companies, or FinTechs. Our solutions enable our customers to deliver robust suites of digital banking, lending, leasing, and banking as a service, or BaaS, services that make it possible for End Users to transact and engage anytime, anywhere and on any device. Our solutions are often the most frequent point of engagement between our customers and their End Users. As such, we purpose-build our solutions to deliver compelling and consistent End User experiences across digital channels and to drive the success of our customers by optimizing their digital brands and enhancing End User acquisition, retention and engagement.
Our founding team has over 25 years of experience developing and delivering secure, advanced digital solutions designed to help our customers compete in the complex and heavily-regulated financial services industry. Q2 began by providing digital banking solutions to RCFIs with the mission of empowering them to leverage technology to compete more effectively and to strengthen the communities and End Users they serve. Through investment in innovation and acquisitions, our solutions have grown to include a broader range of services and experiences, including corporate banking, regulatory and compliance, digital lending and leasing, BaaS and digital account opening and sales and marketing solutions, further serving the needs of RCFIs as well as Alt-FIs and FinTechs. 
The RCFI market includes approximately 11,000 banks and credit unions with less than $100 billion in assets according to data compiled by BauerFinancial as of September 30, 2018. To date, a substantial majority of our revenues continue to come from sales of our digital banking platform to RCFIs, and we continue to be focused on our founding mission of building stronger communities by strengthening their financial institutions.
The growth and adoption of digital financial services creates challenges and opportunities in the markets served by RCFIs as well as emerging providers such as Alt-FIs and FinTechs. The proliferation and ubiquity of mobile and tablet devices and End Users' increasing expectations for digital services have driven increases in the number of providers, greater fragmentation of financial services markets and a broadening set of new and innovative digital services. End Users increasingly expect to transact and engage with financial services providers anytime, anywhere and on any device, and seamlessly across devices. End Users also select digital solutions based on the quality and intuitiveness of the digital user experience.
RCFIs, Alt-FIs and FinTechs are seeking to address these challenges and opportunities and capture End User engagement by providing new, innovative digital financial services, solutions and experiences. Traditional financial services providers such

as banks and credit unions are experiencing reduced End User engagement in their physical branches and increased End User engagement with their digital services and thus they are increasing their investment in digital services. Emerging providers such as Alt-FIs and FinTechs are leveraging their digital focus and expertise and capitalizing on increased End User demand for digital financial services by creating new and expanding existing digital service offerings. This combined investment by traditional and emerging financial services providers is driving further competition, segmentation and innovation. 
Despite the competition between traditional and emerging financial service providers, the digital solutions offered by emerging financial services providers are often dependent upon core banking functions, creating an interdependency between them. Financial institutions of all sizes provide two fundamental banking functions among others - they hold NCUA-insured or FDIC-insured deposits and they transfer money. Providing these critical banking functions generally requires a federal or state banking charter, as well as specialized expertise and infrastructure, and subjects the provider to complex regulatory oversight by various authorities, which requires financial institutions to implement and maintain complex and costly operating policies, procedures and infrastructure to protect End Users, their deposits and their personal information. As emerging financial services providers explore new digital services offerings, they often utilize the banking services of financial institutions in partnership rather than making the significant investments in expertise and infrastructure necessary to obtain a banking charter and otherwise become regulatory-compliant.
The Alt-FI and FinTech markets consist of thousands of emerging financial services providers all over the world seeking to provide End Users with financial services, experiences and solutions that can be competitive with, but also complimentary to and dependent upon banking. Alt-FIs and FinTechs are typically less constrained than traditional financial services providers are by legacy technology solutions, physical branch locations and regulation. Alt-FIs and FinTechs have received substantial investment, estimated to be greater than $100 billion from 2008 through 2017, according to a September 2017 report published by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, or Deloitte, citing Venture Scanner source data entitled "FinTech by the Numbers - Incumbents, startups, investors adapt to maturing ecosystem." 
We have continuously invested in expanding and improving our digital banking platform since its introduction in 2005. In addition, over the past three years we have acquired or developed new solutions and additional functions that serve a broader range of needs of RCFIs as well as the needs of Alt-FIs and FinTechs. Our solutions now include a broad range of services and experiences including corporate banking, regulatory and compliance, digital lending and leasing, BaaS and digital account opening and sales and marketing solutions. We believe our expanded solution offerings and the corresponding growth of our customer base and market opportunity have increased the addressable market for our solutions to greater than $8.0 billion.
Our solutions utilize a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, delivery model, designed to scale with our customers as they grow their business, add End Users on our solutions and expand the breadth of digital services and solutions they offer. Our SaaS delivery model is also designed to reduce the cost and complexity of implementing, maintaining and enhancing the digital services and solutions our customers provide to their End Users. 
We design and develop our solutions with an open platform approach intended to provide comprehensive integration among our solution offerings and our customers' internal and third-party systems. This integrated approach allows our customers to deliver unified and robust financial experiences across digital channels. Our solutions provide our customers the flexibility to configure their digital services in a manner that is consistent with each customer's specific workflows, processes and controls. Our solutions also allow our customers to personalize the digital experiences they deliver to their End Users by extending their individual services and brand requirements across digital channels. Our solutions and our data center infrastructure and resources are designed to comply with the stringent security and technical regulations applicable to financial institutions and financial services providers and to safeguard our customers' data and that of their End Users. 
We believe that financial services providers are best served by a broad integrated portfolio of digital solutions that provide rapid, flexible and comprehensive integration with internal and third-party systems allowing them to provide modern, intuitive digital financial services in a secure, regulatory-compliant manner. We also believe that the breadth and depth of our solution offerings across the RCFI, Alt-FI and FinTech markets, our open and flexible platform approach, our position as a leading provider of digital banking solutions to a large network of RCFIs, and our expertise in delivering new, innovative, secure and regulatory-compliant digital solutions uniquely position us in the market for digital financial services solutions. 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 401 installed digital banking platform customers located in 48 states, and those customers had approximately 12.8 million consumer and commercial users registered on our digital banking platform. Registered users of our digital banking platform, or Registered Users, executed over $762 billion in financial transactions on our digital banking platform during 2018. Please see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operationsâ€”Key Operation Measures" for additional detail on how we define "Installed Customers" and "Registered Users."

We primarily sell subscriptions to our solutions through our direct sales organization and recognize the related revenues over the terms of our customer agreements. The initial term of our digital banking platform agreements averages over five years, although it varies by customer. Our digital banking platform revenues generally increase as we add new customers, sell additional solutions to existing customers, the number of End Users on our solutions grows and the number of transactions that End Users perform on our solutions increases. The structure and terms of our newer lending and leasing and BaaS solution arrangements are varied, but generally are also sold on a subscription basis through our direct sales organization, and the related revenues are recognized over the terms of the customer agreements.
We have achieved significant growth since our inception. We had total revenues of $241.1 million, $194.0 million, and $150.2 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, to grow our business by expanding our sales and marketing activities, developing and acquiring new solutions, enhancing our existing solutions and technical infrastructure and scaling our operations. We incurred net losses of $35.4 million, $26.2 million and $36.4 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had total assets of $463.7 million and $212.8 million, respectively.
We were incorporated in March 2005 in the state of Delaware under the name CBG Holdings, Inc. We changed our name to Q2 Holdings, Inc. in March 2013. We are headquartered in Austin, Texas, and our principal executive offices are located at 13785 Research Blvd, Suite 150, Austin, Texas 78750. Our telephone number is (512) 275-0072. 
Industry Background
The financial services market is intensely competitive. The growth and adoption of digital financial services has and continues to create challenges and opportunities for both traditional providers such as RCFIs as well as emerging providers such as Alt-FIs and FinTechs. 
The proliferation and adoption of mobile and tablet devices and digital services are dramatically changing the financial services market
The proliferation and ubiquity of mobile and tablet devices and End Users' increasing expectations for digital services have driven increases in the number of financial services providers, greater fragmentation of the financial services market and a broadening set of new and innovative digital financial services. End Users increasingly expect to transact and engage with financial services providers anytime, anywhere and on any device, and seamlessly across devices. These changes in the financial services market and in End User expectations create challenges and opportunities for RCFIs as well as emerging financial services providers such as Alt-FIs and FinTechs.
RCFIs, Alt-FIs and FinTechs are seeking to address these challenges and opportunities and capture End User engagement by providing an ever-broadening set of new and innovative digital financial services, solutions and experiences which better align with End Users' increasingly digital lives, experiences and interactions. These services, experiences and solutions include, among other things, account opening, deposits, investments, payments, money transfers, credit card management and loan applications.
The digital solutions offered by emerging financial services providers are often dependent upon core banking functions, creating an interdependency between emerging and traditional financial services providers. Financial institutions of all sizes provide two fundamental banking functions among others - they hold NCUA-insured or FDIC-insured deposits and they transfer money. Providing these critical banking functions generally requires a federal or state banking charter, as well as specialized expertise and infrastructure, and subjects the provider to complex regulatory oversight by various authorities. As an example, electronic payment transactions in the United States, other than wire transfers, are conducted as automated clearinghouse, or ACH, transactions, which settle through the Federal Reserve System in most cases, and generally, only financial institutions can obtain the necessary master account with a Federal Reserve Bank to settle transactions. These laws and regulations have existed for decades, are extremely burdensome and constantly evolving, and require financial institutions to implement and maintain complex and costly operating policies, procedures and infrastructure to protect End Users, their deposits and their personal information. As emerging financial services providers explore new digital services offerings, they often utilize the banking services of financial institutions in partnership rather than making the significant investments in expertise and infrastructure necessary to obtain a banking charter and otherwise become regulatory-compliant.
Security is paramount for digital financial services
The risks of theft and fraud have always existed in banking and financial services. However, as the adoption, use, and breadth of digital financial services offerings has increased, the incidence of fraud and theft in digital channels has grown substantially. The methods by which criminals seek to commit fraud are constantly changing, requiring financial services providers and their technology providers to continually modify their security strategies. In addition, safeguarding the funds and 
5

information of financial service providers and their End Users becomes increasingly complex as digital financial services grow and extend across new channels, devices, and services not previously contemplated.
Digital financial services are highly regulated
Financial services providers and their solutions are subject to extensive and complex regulations and oversight by federal, state and other regulatory authorities. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and affect the conduct of financial service providers' operations and, as a result, the business of their technology providers. The compliance of digital financial solutions with these regulatory requirements depends on a variety of factors, including functionality and design, the classification of the financial service provider and its services, and the manner in which the financial service provider and its End Users utilize the solutions. In order to comply with and assist financial service providers in complying with these laws, technology providers to financial service providers may be required to implement operating policies and procedures to protect the privacy and security of their, the financial service providers' and their End Users' information, and to undergo periodic audits and examinations. Maintaining such regulatory compliance becomes increasingly complex as digital financial services grow and extend across new channels, devices, and services not previously contemplated.
Digital financial services are complex and often have limitations
The continued proliferation of mobile and tablet devices and digital solutions offered through open development platforms makes it increasingly difficult to provide a consistent, intuitive and personalized End User experience and requires digital solutions to support new and rapidly changing mobile operating systems and device types. The technical and operational complexities of delivering integrated digital solutions across multiple operating systems, devices, channels, and complex functionality increase the difficulty of providing a consistent, intuitive and personalized End User experience. Aging or increasingly complex solutions can create the following challenges for financial services providers:

â€¢ | integrating applications and systems from multiple vendors may increase costs and time-to-market;


â€¢ | managing relationships with multiple vendors can be time consuming and require greater management infrastructure;


â€¢ | building, maintaining and upgrading regulatory-compliant and secure solutions and infrastructure can be expensive and time-consuming and require special expertise that can be hard to find and retain;


â€¢ | operating, supporting and upgrading systems from multiple vendors can be difficult, costly and less secure and limit the ability to provide a unified End User experience or comprehensive view of End User behavior;


â€¢ | partnering with FinTechs and Alt-FIs and innovating and delivering new solutions can be difficult and cost-prohibitive when integration with dated legacy infrastructure is required; and


â€¢ | training End Users and internal personnel on the use of different point systems can be challenging, time-consuming and costly.

The use of multiple point systems for digital financial services can require End Users to maintain different login credentials across digital channels and learn and understand different systems. Additionally, the disjointed nature of the underlying workflows, data and terminology caused by the implementation of multiple solutions can lead to decreased End User adoption, retention and satisfaction. End Users' adoption, retention and satisfaction can also be adversely impacted by the dated End User interfaces of older legacy systems.
The market for digital financial services is significant
We define RCFIs as federally-insured banks and credit unions with less than $100 billion in assets, which according to data compiled by BauerFinancial as of September 30, 2018, consisted of approximately 11,000 financial institutions with combined assets of $7.3 trillion, representing 38% of assets held by all federally-insured financial institutions. RCFIs have historically sought to differentiate themselves by providing local, personalized banking services that are responsive to the changing needs and circumstances of their communities. Many RCFIs are locally-owned and obtain deposits and make lending decisions on a local basis. RCFIs account for a large portion of small business loans, helping local businesses create jobs and drive economic growth in the communities they serve. RCFIs seek to develop strong, lasting relationships with their End Users and can serve as centers of commerce and influence in their communities.
The Alt-FI and FinTech markets consist of thousands of emerging financial services providers all over the world seeking to provide End Users with new and innovative financial services, experiences and solutions that can be competitive with, but also complimentary to and dependent upon banking. Alt-FIs and FinTechs are typically more nimble and development-focused and less constrained than traditional financial services providers are by legacy technology solutions, physical branch locations and regulation. Alt-FIs and FinTechs have received substantial investment, estimated to be greater than $100 billion from 2008 
6

through 2017, according to a September 2017 report published by Deloitte citing Venture Scanner source data entitled "FinTech by the Numbers - Incumbents, startups, investors adapt to maturing ecosystem."
 We have continuously invested in expanding and improving our digital banking platform since its introduction in 2005. In addition, over the past three years we have acquired or developed new solutions and additional functions that serve a broader range of needs of RCFIs as well as the needs of Alt-FIs and FinTechs. Our solutions now include a broad range of services and experiences including corporate banking, regulatory and compliance, digital lending and leasing, BaaS and digital account opening and sales and marketing solutions. Our expanded solution offerings and the corresponding growth of our customer base and market opportunity have increased our addressable market.
Based on our estimates of the number of target RCFIs for our digital banking solutions and our internal assumptions as to the number and types of digital accounts they serve, the prices for our solutions and the number of transactions processed, we believe that the market for our digital banking solutions, including retail, small business, corporate, digital account opening and Centrix solutions is greater than $5.0 billion. Based on our estimate of the number of target providers of digital lending and leasing services and our internal assumptions as to the number of End Users they serve and the prices for our solutions, we believe that the market for our digital lending and leasing solutions, including the borrower portal, origination, underwriting, servicing and collections modules, is greater than $2.0 billion. The market for our open application programming interface, or API, solutions for financial services generally, including potential customer segments and product use cases, is relatively new, broad and continually evolving. Based on our estimates of the number of target RCFIs, Alt-FIs and FinTechs for our BaaS solutions and our internal assumptions as to the number of End Users they serve, the prices for our solutions and the number of transactions processed, we believe the market for our BaaS solutions is greater than $1.0 billion. In the aggregate, we believe that the worldwide market for our solutions is greater than $8.0 billion.
The continued proliferation of mobile and tablet devices and digital solutions offered through open development platforms makes it increasingly difficult to provide a consistent, intuitive and personalized End User experience and requires digital solutions to support new and rapidly changing mobile operating systems and device types. The technical and operational complexities of delivering secure, regulatory-compliant, integrated digital solutions across multiple operating systems, devices, channels, and complex functionality increases the difficulty of providing a consistent, intuitive and personalized End User experience. 
We believe that financial services providers are best served by a broad integrated portfolio of digital solutions that provide rapid, flexible and comprehensive integration with internal and third-party systems allowing them to provide modern, intuitive digital financial services in a secure, regulatory-compliant manner. We have deep domain expertise in new, innovative, secure and regulatory-compliant digital solutions in the complex and highly-regulated financial services industry and with the technical and operational complexities of delivering integrated financial services solutions across multiple operating systems, devices and channels. As a result, we believe that the breadth and depth of our solution offerings across the RCFI, Alt-FI and FinTech markets, our open and flexible platform approach, our position as a leading provider of digital banking solutions to a large network of RCFIs, and our expertise in delivering new, innovative, secure and regulatory-compliant digital solutions uniquely position us in the market for digital financial services solutions.

Key Benefits
Our solutions provide the following key benefits to our customers and their End Users:

â€¢ | Intuitive design: We designed from inception the features and End User experience of our solutions to be optimized for touch-based devices and then extend that design to other digital channels. This design process and our broad feature offerings enable our solutions to deliver a modern, unified End User experience across digital channels.


â€¢ | Comprehensive view of End Users: Our digital banking platform provides our RCFI customers with a comprehensive view of End User access and activity across devices and channels. The understanding and analysis made possible by a comprehensive view enable an enhanced, personalized End User experience, real-time risk and fraud assessment and other analytic features that improve the function and security of our solutions.


â€¢ | Flexible integration: We have developed a highly flexible set of integration tools, enabling the rapid integration of third-party applications and data sources. These integration tools connect with over 200 third-party applications, allowing us to seamlessly integrate with our customers' internal and third-party systems such as account services, payments and imaging.


â€¢ | SaaS delivery model: We developed our solutions to be cloud-based. Our customers subscribe and pay for their use of our solutions over time, and our solutions do not require our customers to install any significant technical infrastructure. While we host our digital banking platform for substantially all of our RCFI customers, our lending, leasing, and BaaS solutions are hosted with industry leading public cloud services. Our SaaS delivery model can reduce the total cost of ownership of our customers by providing the development, implementation, integration, maintenance, monitoring and support of our cloud-based solutions on a subscription basis. Our solutions are designed to support the rapid addition of new services as well as the introduction of new devices and digital channels. As a result, our customers can easily scale the use of our solutions with their needs as they add End Users and expand the digital services and solutions they offer.


â€¢ | Regulatory compliance: Our solutions leverage our deep domain expertise and the significant investments we have made in the design and development of our data center architecture and other technical infrastructure, including public cloud services, to meet the stringent security and technical requirements on financial institutions and financial services providers. Customers who use our cloud-based solutions are able to satisfy security and technical compliance obligations by relying on the security programs and regulatory certification of our data centers and other technical infrastructure. By doing so, our customers avoid the significant cost and effort associated with building, maintaining and upgrading a regulatory-compliant and secure environment on their own.


â€¢ | Delivery of robust digital financial services across multiple channels: Our solutions enable our customers to deliver robust and integrated digital financial services to their End Users who increasingly expect and appreciate the freedom to transact and engage anytime, anywhere and on any device. Through a single log-in and consistent workflow, End Users are able to seamlessly conduct consumer and commercial transactions across digital channels and devices.


â€¢ | Improved and more frequent engagement with End Users: The breadth of our solutions and quality of the End User experience they provide enable our customers to increase the frequency and effectiveness of their interactions with End Users. We believe the frequency and ease of these interactions can strengthen the relationships between End Users and our customers and help our customers better serve their End Users through a more comprehensive understanding of their behavior and activities.


â€¢ | Drive End User loyalty: We believe our customers are able to drive loyalty by increasing their level of End User engagement. Our customers are able to tailor our solutions by offering individually relevant functionality as well as branded, localized End User experiences. Our digital banking platform provides our RCFI customers with a

8

comprehensive view of operational and End User activity across channels and devices allowing them to look for opportunities to improve End User engagement and grow their End User relationships with targeted offerings based on specific behavior. We believe this further strengthens End User loyalty by enabling our customers to engage End Users through customized and End User-friendly digital experiences.

â€¢ | More effective marketing of products and services: Our customers' marketing of their new and existing products and services through our solutions can be frequent, timely and targeted. The ease and availability of communications within digital channels also make it easier for End Users to find information about products and services. Our solutions also offer a simplified transaction experience, which can help improve sales of products and services.


â€¢ | Real-time security: We employ multi-layered controls to help secure our customers' and End Users' information. Each layer addresses specific areas of possible fraud or data vulnerability. Our customers can use transactional-based controls to reduce fraudulent transactions by allowing them to adjust configurations such as transaction values, payment windows or account suspension. Our digital banking platform customers who leverage our Q2 Sentinel product are able to block suspected fraudulent activity in real-time at the application layer and notify operations staff and End Users of suspect transactions prior to consummation of a transaction. This approach reduces and better manages the security risks in financial services and help protect our customers' reputations.

Our Business Strengths
Since our inception, our mission has been to help financial institutions succeed and strengthen the markets they serve. We are highly committed to this mission, and support it by focusing on designing, developing and acquiring new, innovative digital banking and other financial services solutions to meet transforming End User expectations. We believe we are well positioned to connect and serve traditional and emerging financial services providers as they transform the ways in which they engage, either independently or in partnership, with End Users globally: 

â€¢ | Our purpose-built digital banking platform leads the RCFI digital banking market: We built our digital banking platform to address unique challenges that RCFIs face in providing digital banking services. Our digital banking platform was created to support the proliferation of mobile and tablet devices and the speed at which their use has become a common part of daily life. Our digital banking platform reduces the inefficiencies of traditional point-to-point integration strategies and replaces multiple management consoles with a single unified view of the rules, rights and security involved with operating seamlessly across digital channels. Our digital banking solutions enable our RCFI customers to provide a compelling, unified End User experience to consumer and commercial End Users using a single login anywhere, anytime and on any device. We believe our deep domain experience as a leading provider of digital banking solutions positions us well to provide new, innovative digital banking and other financial services solutions to meet transforming End User expectations.


â€¢ | We have acquired and developed solutions to better serve our RCFI customers and a broader set of global financial service providers including Alt-FIs and FinTechs: Over the past few years, we have expanded our portfolio to include offerings such as our end-to-end lending and leasing, BaaS and digital account opening and sales and marketing solutions. As the financial services landscape has evolved to become more digitized and open, we have strived to ensure our customers can offer a broader range of digital services to their End Users.


â€¢ | We have a proven track record in providing digital solutions to financial services providers: Our founders and management have a track record of successfully delivering technology for financial services providers. We have deep domain expertise in financial services and community banking which we utilize to develop and deliver our solutions and services to our customers.


â€¢ | Our sales model is tailored to our different markets: The RCFI market is well defined and allows us to effectively direct our go-to-market strategy for our sales and marketing efforts. Utilizing the deep industry experience of our management and sales teams, we are able to leverage our relationships with leaders and influencers at many of our RCFI customers as valuable sources of reference and promotion. We have also developed actionable insights into our sales and marketing performance, enabling us to be efficient with our go-to-market investments. The Alt-FI and FinTech markets are relatively new, broad and continually evolving. As a result, we utilize third-party partnerships and insights from our experience with RCFI customers to effectively pursue these markets. 


â€¢ | We grow our customer relationships over time: Throughout our long-term customer relationships, we employ a structured strategy designed to inform, educate and enhance customer confidence and help our customers identify and implement additional solutions to benefit and grow their End User bases.

9


â€¢ | Our revenues are highly predictable: To date, a substantial majority of our revenues continue to result from sales of our digital banking platform to RCFIs. We generally recognize our revenues over the terms of our customer agreements. The initial term of our digital banking platform customer agreements averages over five years, although it varies by customer. Our long-term agreements and our high customer retention, as well as the growth over time in the number of End Users using our solutions, drive the recurring nature of our revenues and provide us with significant visibility into future revenues. Furthermore, we believe our customer services model drives high retention rates and incremental sales of our solutions.


â€¢ | Our award-winning culture drives innovation and customer success: We believe our award-winning, innovation-focused culture and the location of our operations facilitate recruiting and retaining top development, integration and design talent. We are headquartered in Austin, Texas which is a vibrant city that continues to attract an increasing number of young professionals and has close ties to leading research institutions. In each of the past eight years, the Austin American Statesman recognized us as one of Austin's "Top Places to Work." We believe our mission, combined with our focus on delivering leading-edge digital solutions, enables us to attract and retain top talent.

Our Growth Strategy
We believe we are well positioned to connect and serve traditional and emerging financial services providers as they transform the ways in which they engage, either independently or in partnership, with End Users globally. To accomplish this goal, we are pursuing the following growth strategies:

â€¢ | Further penetrate our large market opportunity: We believe RCFIs are increasingly adopting cloud-based digital banking solutions. With the ubiquity of mobile and tablet devices, and resulting proliferation of mobile digital solutions provided through their open developer platforms, End Users are increasingly engaging with RCFIs, Alt-FIs and FinTechs across a variety of digital channels. Over the past three years, in response to the increasing demand for innovative digital banking and other financial services, we have expanded our addressable market by acquiring and developing solutions that serve the needs of a broader, global set of emerging financial services providers such as Alt-FIs and FinTechs and their End Users, which also facilitates partnerships with and integration to the digital solutions of our RCFI customers. We intend to further penetrate our large market opportunity and increase our number of RCFI, Alt-FI and FinTech customers using our broad range of digital solutions through acquiring and developing additional solutions, investments in our sales and marketing organization and related activities.


â€¢ | Grow revenues by expanding our relationships with existing customers: We believe there is significant opportunity to expand our relationships with existing customers by selling additional solutions such as our lending and leasing and digital account opening and sales and marketing solutions. In addition, our revenues from existing customers continue to grow as these customers increase the number of End Users on our solutions and as the number of transactions these End Users perform on our solutions increases. We believe our recent investments in digital lending, leasing, BaaS, digital account opening and sales and marketing, and other innovative solutions will help our customers expand their relationships with us by allowing them to more efficiently sell and market additional services and solutions to their End Users.


â€¢ | Continue to expand our solutions offerings and enhance our platform: We believe our history of innovation distinguishes us in the market, and we intend to continue to invest in our software development efforts and introduce new solutions that are largely informed by and aligned with the business objectives of our existing and new customers. For example, in June 2017, we introduced Q2 Open, a portfolio of open API financial services which are designed to allow RCFIs, Alt-FIs and FinTechs to develop and support their own digital financial services and solutions more quickly and cost-effectively. Q2 Open additionally provides an opportunity for our RCFI customers to partner with Alt-FIs and FinTechs in providing innovative digital services and solutions to meet evolving End User demands. In October of 2018, we acquired Cloud Lending Solutions, or Cloud Lending. With the Cloud Lending acquisition, we added to our portfolio of solutions an end-to-end digital lending and leasing platform which allows RCFIs, Alt-FIs and FinTechs to automate and digitize lending and leasing related activities. In November of 2018, we acquired Gro Solutions, or Gro. With the Gro acquisition, we added Q2 Gro to our portfolio of solutions, a digital online account opening and sales and marketing platform which enables customers to make personalized recommendations and cross-sell banking products, such as deposit accounts and loans.


â€¢ | Selectively pursue acquisitions and strategic investments: In addition to continuing to develop our solutions organically, we regularly evaluate strategic opportunities, such as our acquisitions of Centrix, Social Money, Unbill, Cloud Lending and Gro. We anticipate that we will continue to selectively pursue acquisitions of and strategic investments in technologies that will strengthen and expand the features and functionality of our solutions and provide access to new customers and new markets.

BaaS Solutions
In June 2017, we introduced Q2 Open, a portfolio of open API financial services which are designed to allow RCFIs, Alt-FIs and FinTechs to develop and support their own applications and digital financial services. Q2 Open additionally provides an opportunity for our RCFI customers to partner with Alt-FIs and FinTechs in providing new innovative digital financial services to meet evolving consumer expectations. Q2 Open is an open API portfolio which allows development-capable organizations to build front-end interfaces and experiences on top of Q2 Open API infrastructure:

Solution | Features 
Q2 CorePro API | â€¢ An agile, cloud-based core processor that provides API tools and supporting functionality designed to enable customers to develop applications which leverage ledgering functionality and federally insured checking accounts with branded debit cards integrated into Visa or MasterCard networks and federally insured savings accounts and "for the benefit of", or FBO, accounts 
Q2 Biller Direct | â€¢ Open API tools and supporting functionality designed to enable customers to aggregate End Users' bills and payments into a single view, enabling bill presentment, aggregation and bill pay functionality into the customers' applications 

Implementation and Customer Support 
We seek to deepen and grow our customer relationships by providing consistent, high-quality implementation and customer support services, which we believe drive higher customer retention and incremental sales opportunities within our existing customer base. We structure our implementation teams to effectively collaborate with the management and technology teams of our customers ensuring the rapid deployment and effective utilization of our solutions. Under certain circumstances for our digital lending and leasing solutions, we partner with third-party professional system integrators to support our customers in the installation and configuration process. These implementation teams develop and execute a coordinated implementation plan for our customers centered around five standard phases of IT transformation projects: initiation, configuration, application testing, limited production and production.
Our customer support personnel serve the comprehensive support-related needs of our customers. Due to the highly-regulated and complex nature of the financial services industry, our implementation and customer support service teams, including any third-party professional system integrators with which we partner, must be knowledgeable about our solutions and the regulatory environment in which our customers are required to operate.
Partner Offerings
Our customers are reliant on an ever-growing ecosystem of third-party digital solutions to complement their financial services offerings and we provide a broad range of tools to help our customers efficiently bring them to market. The flexible nature of our solutions, along with an internally developed, highly flexible set of integration tools allows us to build rapid integrations with our customers' internal and third-party systems to support End User activities and customer processes. These integration tools connect with over 200 third-party applications, allowing us to seamlessly integrate with our customers' internal and third-party systems such as account services, payments and imaging. Our ability to integrate with these systems enables our customers to offer a comprehensive set of consumer and commercial functionality to their End Users.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing organization is responsible for growing our customer base and maintaining and expanding relationships with our existing customers. We sell our solutions primarily through our direct sales organization but also through partnerships for select solutions and global regions. Our direct sales organization consists of experienced sales professionals who are organized by geography, account size, type of market and whether a prospect is a new or existing customer. Customers are assigned a dedicated representative to provide ongoing assistance in the execution of the customer's digital strategy to meet the needs of its End Users. Our sales representatives are supported by our solutions consulting and sales operations teams.
Our marketing team complements our sales organization through lead generation, brand building, analyst relations, public relations and industry research. While the RCFI market is well-defined due to the regulatory classifications of those financial institutions, the Alt-FI and FinTech markets are broader and more difficult to define due to the changing number of providers in each market. We focus our marketing efforts on industry-specific tradeshows, publications, digital newsletters, digital advertising as well as referral agreements with strategic industry partners. Our marketing team also conducts primary research to support our industry thought leadership and to identify emerging trends in End User behavior and digital activities. Our marketing programs primarily target digital transformation, technology, finance, operations and marketing executives as well as senior business leaders.

Research and Development
Our focus on innovation has fueled our growth and enables us to provide our customers secure, cloud-based digital solutions that transform the ways in which traditional and emerging financial service providers engage with End Users. We allocate significant resources to developing and improving our solutions to meet our customers' evolving needs. We monitor and test our solutions regularly, and we maintain a disciplined release process to enhance our existing solutions and introduce new capabilities without interrupting service delivery. We follow state-of-the-art practices in software development and design, including using modern programming languages, data storage systems and other tools. Our multi-tiered architecture enables us to scale, add and modify features quickly in response to changing market dynamics, customer needs and regulatory requirements. Our platform approach supports rapid development and deployment of new features to address evolving market needs. We also enable customers to address their market-specific needs via our extension and integration frameworks, which is a key aspect of our technology strategy. 
Technology and Operations
Due to the highly regulated nature of the financial services industry, our digital banking platform combines both multi-tenant and single instance aspects. This structure is designed to maximize End User data security and minimize compliance cost and risks. Our solutions utilize a multi-tiered architecture that allows for scalability, operational simplicity, security and disaster recovery. We have also developed an internal operations and analytics platform that aggregates, and leverages customer instance and End User experience captured within our solutions to drive future innovation and scale.
We serve our digital banking platform customers from two secure, third-party, American National Standards Institute Tier 4 data center facilities, one located in Carrollton, Texas and the other located in Austin, Texas. Both data centers are operated by the same third-party provider. Our digital lending and leasing and BaaS solutions are hosted by cloud-based hosting services, including Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. We believe that our current data centers have sufficient capacity to meet our anticipated growth for the foreseeable future. Although we utilize a third party to manage our data center facilities for our digital banking platform, we manage the hardware and software on which our digital banking platform operates. We utilize industry standard hardware in resilient configurations to minimize service interruptions, and regularly consider and implement improvements to enhance the resiliency of our services, including our recent improvements to actively distribute services across both data centers. As a result of these improvements, our network infrastructure is fully redundant within each of our data centers, including network teaming to provide network redundancy that includes multiple upstream Internet connections. We have also purchased a private block of IP address space to simplify and expedite our disaster recovery management operations for our digital banking platform customers.
Our digital banking platform has had average uptime in excess of 99.9% since January 2013. We actively monitor our infrastructure 24x7 for any sign of failure, and we seek to take preemptive action to minimize and prevent downtime. Our data centers employ advanced measures to ensure physical integrity and security, including redundant power from multiple substations and cooling systems, fire and flood prevention mechanisms, continual security coverage and biometric readers at entry points as well as perimeter boundary security measures. We have also implemented extensive disaster recovery measures and continue to invest in data center and other technical infrastructure.
All End Users are authenticated, authorized and validated before they can access our solutions. End Users must have at a minimum, a valid user ID and associated password. Many of our customers also employ other authentication methods such as out-of-band one-time password delivery to log on to our solutions and hardware cryptographic tokens to authorize transactions. Our layered security model allows different groups of End Users to have different levels of access to our solutions. Our solutions' vulnerability is tested using internal tools prior to release, and an independent third party performs penetration and vulnerability tests on our solutions periodically.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secrets and copyright laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights. As of December 31, 2018, we had nine U.S. patent applications pending and two issued U.S. patents. Our issued patents, which expire in March 2028, relate to our intellectual property created to address technology integration challenges for RCFIs. We use the software components and methods claimed in these patents to access the data from several different types of RCFIs and to allow us to deliver our online, mobile, tablet, voice and text solutions to their End Users without having to individually integrate each solution with each RCFI's data. Despite substantial investment in research and development activities, we have not focused on patents and patent applications historically. We license third-party technologies, such as bill pay technologies, that are incorporated into some of our solutions.
15

The efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient or effective. It may be possible for other parties to copy or otherwise obtain and use the content of our solutions without authorization. Failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could significantly harm our competitive position and operating results.
Companies in the Internet and technology industries, and other patent and trademark holders seeking to profit from royalties in connection with grants of licenses, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past, and will likely in the future, receive notices that claim we have misappropriated or misused other parties' intellectual property rights. There may be intellectual property rights held by others, including issued or pending patents and trademarks that cover significant aspects of our solutions. Any intellectual property claim against us, regardless of merit, could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate and could divert our management's attention and other resources. These claims could also subject us to significant liability for damages and could result in our having to stop using solutions found to be in violation of another party's rights. We might be required or may opt to seek a license for rights to intellectual property held by others, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if a license is available, we could be required to pay significant royalties, which would increase our operating expenses. We may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing solutions, which could require significant effort and expense and which we may not be able to perform efficiently or at all. If we cannot license the intellectual property at issue or develop non-infringing solutions for any allegedly infringing aspect of our business, we may be unable to compete effectively.
Our Competition
The market for digital solutions for financial services providers is highly competitive. We compete with new and established point solution vendors, core processing vendors, as well as internally developed solutions. We believe that the comprehensive integration among our solution offerings and our customers' internal and third-party systems, combined with our deep industry expertise, reputation for consistent, high-quality customer support, and our unified cloud-based digital banking, digital lending and leasing and BaaS solutions distinguish us from the competition. 
We currently compete with providers of technology and services in the financial services industry, including new and established point system vendors and core processing vendors, as well as systems internally-developed by our customers. With respect to our digital banking platform, we compete against a number of point system competitors, including NCR Corporation, First Data Corporation, D3 Technology, Inc., Alkami Technology, Inc. and Kony, Inc. in the online, consumer and small business banking space and Finastra, ACI Worldwide, Inc., Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., or FIS, and Bottomline Technologies (de), Inc. in the commercial banking space. We also compete with core processing vendors that provide systems and services such as Fiserv, Inc., or Fiserv, Jack Henry and Associates, Inc. and FIS. With respect to our lending and leasing platform, we compete against a number of point system competitors, including Abrigo, Baker Hill Solutions, LLC, Fair Isaac Corporation, nCino, Inc., Finastra, Moody's Analytics, Inc., Oracle corporation, Temenos AG, and core processing vendors, including FIS and Fiserv. With respect to BaaS solutions, due to the vast number of potential use cases and customer segments, the list of potential competitors is extremely broad and varied, but includes companies across the retail banking, financial services, transaction processing, consumer technology and financial technology services industries. 
Many of our competitors have significantly more financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have, may devote greater resources to the promotion, sale and support of their systems than we can, have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships than we have and have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we have. In addition, many of our competitors expend more funds on research and development. 
Although we compete with point system vendors and core processing vendors, we also partner with some of these vendors for certain data and services utilized in our solutions and receive referrals from them. In addition, certain of our customers have or can obtain the ability to create their own in-house systems, and while many of these systems have difficulties scaling and providing an integrated platform, we still face challenges displacing in-house systems and retaining customers that choose to develop an in-house system.
We believe the principal competitive factors for our solutions in the financial services markets we serve include the following:

â€¢ | alignment with the missions of our customers;


â€¢ | ability to provide a single platform for consumer and commercial End Users;


â€¢ | full-feature functionality across digital channels;


â€¢ | ability to integrate targeted offers for End Users across digital channels;


â€¢ | ability to support RCFIs in acquiring deposits with open API technologies;

16


â€¢ | SaaS delivery and pricing model;


â€¢ | ability to support both internal and external developers to quickly integrate with third-party applications and systems utilizing a software development kit;


â€¢ | design of the End User experience, including modern, intuitive and touch-centric features;


â€¢ | configurability and branding capabilities for customers;


â€¢ | familiarity of workflows and terminology and feature-on-demand functionality;


â€¢ | integrated multi-layered security and compliance of solutions with regulatory requirements;


â€¢ | quality of implementation, integration and support services;


â€¢ | domain expertise and innovation in financial services technology;


â€¢ | ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly; and


â€¢ | rate of development, deployment and enhancement of solutions.

We believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors within the RCFI, Alt-FI and FinTech markets we serve, but we expect competition to continue and increase as existing competitors continue to evolve their offerings and as new companies enter our market. To remain competitive, we believe we must continue to invest in research and development, sales and marketing, customer support and our business operations generally.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,190 employees, of which 1,084 were employed in the United States, and 106 were employed outside of the United States. We consider our current relationship with our employees to be good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are a party to a collective bargaining agreement.
Culture
Since our inception, our culture has been rooted in our mission to strengthen communities by strengthening the financial institutions that serve them. We believe our passion, dedication and commitment towards this mission is a significant differentiator for us with our customers and employees. We share our culture through our customer interactions, employee functions and collaborative and educational customer events like our CONNECT client conference, user groups and collaborate focus groups. In each of the past eight years, the Austin American Statesman recognized us as one of Austin's "Top Places to Work."
Presented with regular opportunities to help our customers more successfully compete and grow, we seek out ways to enhance our culture and our ability to make a difference for our customers and their End Users. Our culture is visible across our organization and highlighted through a host of initiatives, programs and committees including the following:

â€¢ | our employee committees focused on culture, wellness, and charitable causes and communications help create opportunities for employees to come together around important causes to make a difference in the work place and local communities;


â€¢ | our emerging leaders management training program identifies and cultivates new and emerging leadership talent within our organization;


â€¢ | our flexible work spaces promote a collaborative, high-energy work environment and help facilitate team-based problem solving and cross-departmental learning;


â€¢ | our work spaces reinforce our mission, guiding principles, promote a collaborative, high-energy work environment and help facilitate team-based problem solving and cross-departmental learning; and


â€¢ | we use technology to engage our own employees to take control of their development, recognize one another and engage in charitable causes.

Government Regulation
As a technology service provider to banks and credit unions in the United States, we are not required to be chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit 
17

Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration or other federal or state agencies that regulate or supervise our customers and other providers of financial services in the United States.
Our customers and prospects are subject to extensive and complex regulations and oversight by federal, state and other regulatory authorities. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and affect the conduct of our customers' operations and, as a result, our business. Our solutions must enable our customers to comply with applicable requirements such as the following:

â€¢ | the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or Dodd-Frank Act;


â€¢ | the Electronic Funds Transfer Act;


â€¢ | Mobile Banking Guidance;


â€¢ | the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act;


â€¢ | federal, state and other usury laws;


â€¢ | the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or GLBA;


â€¢ | the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR;


â€¢ | laws against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices;


â€¢ | the Privacy of Consumer Financial Information regulations;


â€¢ | the Guidance on Supervision of Technology Services Providers promulgated by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, or FFIEC;


â€¢ | the Guidance on Outsourcing Technology Services promulgated by the FFIEC; and


â€¢ | other federal, state and international laws and regulations.

We are subject to periodic examination by banking regulators under the authority of the FFIEC under its Guidance on the Supervision of Technology Services Providers and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, and federal, state and other laws that apply to technology service providers as a result of the services we provide to the institutions and entities they regulate. As an independent technology service provider, we are examined by federal financial regulators on a rotating basis. These examinations are based on guidance from the FFIEC, which is a formal interagency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles, standards and report forms for the examination of financial institutions and to make recommendations to promote uniformity in the supervision of financial institutions. The examinations cover a wide variety of subjects, including our management, acquisition and development activities, support and delivery, IT audits, as well as our disaster preparedness and business recovery planning. The banking regulators that make up the FFIEC have broad supervisory authority to remedy any shortcomings identified in an examination. Following an examination, our financial institutions customers may request an executive summary of the examination through their lead examination agency.
The Dodd-Frank Act granted the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, authority to promulgate rules and interpret certain federal consumer financial protection laws, some of which apply to the solutions we offer. In certain circumstances, the CFPB also has examination and supervision powers with respect to service providers who provide a material service to a financial institution offering consumer financial products and services.
The compliance of our solutions with these requirements depends on a variety of factors, including the functionality and design of our solutions, the classification of our customers, and the manner in which our customers and their End Users utilize our solutions. In order to comply with our obligations under these laws, we are required to implement operating policies and procedures to protect the privacy and security of our customers' and their End Users' information and to undergo periodic audits and examinations.
Privacy and Information Safeguard Laws
In the ordinary course of our business, we and our customers using our solutions access and transmit certain types of data, which subjects us and our customers to certain privacy and information security laws in the United States and internationally, including, for example, GLBA and GDPR, and other laws or rules designed to regulate consumer information and mitigate identity theft. We are also subject to privacy laws of various states. These laws impose obligations with respect to the collection, processing, storage, disposal, use and disclosure of personal information, and require that financial services providers have in place policies regarding information privacy and security. In addition, under certain of these laws, we must provide notice to consumers of our policies and practices for sharing nonpublic information with third parties, provide advance 
18

notice of any changes to our policies and, with limited exceptions, give consumers the right to prevent use of their nonpublic personal information and disclosure of it to unaffiliated third parties. Certain of these laws may, in some circumstances, require us to notify affected individuals of security breaches of computer databases that contain their personal information. These laws may also require us to notify relevant law enforcement, regulators or consumer reporting agencies in the event of a data breach, as well as businesses and governmental agencies that own data. In order to comply with the privacy and information safeguard laws, we have confidentiality and information security standards and procedures in place for our business activities and our third-party vendors and service providers. Privacy and information security laws evolve regularly, requiring us to adjust our compliance program on an ongoing basis and presenting compliance challenges.
