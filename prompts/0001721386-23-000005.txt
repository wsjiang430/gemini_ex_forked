 Item 1. Business
Overview 
Landsea Homes is a rapidly growing homebuilder focused on High Performance Homes that deliver energy efficient living in attractive geographies. Headquartered in Newport Beach, California, we primarily engage in the design, construction, marketing and sale of suburban and urban single-family detached and attached homes in California, Arizona, Florida, Texas, and Metro New York. While we offer a wide range of housing options, we primarily focus on entry-level and first-time move-up homes and believe our markets are characterized by attractive long-term housing fundamentals. Landsea Green indirectly owns 100% of our largest stockholder Landsea Holdings Corporation.
We design and build homes and communities throughout the nation that reflect spaces inspired by modern living and that feature vibrant, prime locations where the homes connect seamlessly with their surroundings and enhance the local lifestyle for living, working, and playing. Our defining principle, “Live in your element®”, creates the foundation for our customers to live where they want to live and how they want to live in a home created especially for them. Drawing on new home innovation and technology, including a partnership with a leading technology company, we are focused on sustainable, energy-efficient, and environmentally friendly building practices that result in a lighter environmental impact, lower resource consumption, and a reduced carbon footprint. The four pillars of our High Performance Homes platform are home automation, energy efficiency, sustainability, and enabling a healthy lifestyle. These pillars are reflected in such features as Wi-Fi mesh networking, smart light switches, smart door locks, smart thermostats, Wi-Fi garage door openers, LED lighting, premium air purifiers, and upgraded insulation. Our efficient home designs help reduce lumber, concrete, and building material waste on our job sites. We are committed to achieving among the highest standards in design, quality, and customer satisfaction and are a leader among our peers on several key operating and homebuilding metrics.
Our communities are positioned in attractive markets like Arizona, California, Florida, and Texas. These markets are characterized by conditions including high in-migration, low new home supply levels, and high levels of employment. We are also prudently evaluating opportunities in new regional markets in which there is high demand and favorable population and employment growth as a result of proximity to job centers or primary transportation corridors. 
Landsea Homes has been recognized locally and nationally for architecture, interior design, website, digital sales resources and more including winning the 2022 Builder of the Year award by BUILDER magazine. Landsea Homes is in the top ratings of similar sized homebuilders nationally for positive customer experience in Eliant Homebuyers’ survey.
While we have construction expertise across a wide array of product offerings, as noted above, we are focused on entry-level and first-time move-up homes. We believe our high concentration in entry-level homes helps position us to meet changing market conditions and to optimize returns while strategically reducing portfolio risk. In addition, our attached and higher density products in certain markets enables us to keep our entry-level price point “attainable” and within reach of more new homebuyers. We believe that bringing attainable housing product helps to offset rising land and home costs and support our expansion into densely populated markets.
Landsea Homes’ revenue has grown rapidly from approximately $29 million in 2017 to over $1.4 billion in 2022. As of December 31, 2022, Landsea Homes owned or controlled 11,593 lots, of which 6,310 lots were under land option contracts or purchase contracts and 5,283 lots were owned. We believe that this represents approximately 3 to 4 years of supply under our current growth plan. We seek to invest in land inventory that we can efficiently develop over a 24-to-36-month horizon in order to maximize our returns on capital and minimize our exposure to market risk. We continue to evaluate new communities and to develop an attractive pipeline of land acquisition opportunities.

In California, Landsea Homes owned and controlled 2,273 lots as of December 31, 2022 in the high-demand San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, and Orange and San Bernardino counties.
In Arizona, Landsea Homes owned and controlled 4,179 lots as of December 31, 2022. Since entering the Arizona market three years ago, Landsea Homes has acquired several communities organically in addition to two Phoenix-based homebuilders. In June 2019, Landsea Homes acquired Pinnacle West Homes (“Pinnacle West”), and in January 2020, Landsea Homes acquired Garrett Walker Homes (“Garrett Walker”), both in the metropolitan Phoenix area. As a result of these acquisitions, we have become one of the largest homebuilders in Arizona. 
In Metro New York, Landsea Homes owned three residential units and one retail unit as of December 31, 2022 related to one project in Manhattan. 
In Florida, Landsea Homes entered the Florida market in May 2021 with its acquisition of Vintage Estate Homes (“Vintage”). We then expanded our footprint in Florida with the acquisition of Hanover Family Builders, LLC (“Hanover”) in January 2022. Landsea Homes owned and controlled 4,051 lots in Florida as of December 31, 2022.
In Texas, Landsea Homes entered the market with the acquisition of Vintage and has since acquired significant land as we continue to expand our operations in that market. Landsea Homes owned and controlled 1,087 lots as of December 31, 2022.
Net new home orders for Landsea Homes for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 1,520 and 1,471, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2022, Landsea Homes delivered 2,370 homes for total home sales revenue of $1,392.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Landsea Homes delivered 1,640 homes for total home sales revenue of $936.4 million.
For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 the average selling price (“ASP”) of homes delivered was approximately $588,000 and $571,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Landsea Homes had a backlog of 670 and 998 sold but unclosed homes, respectively with an associated sales value of $380.9 million and $586.2 million. The ASP of homes in backlog as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was approximately $569,000 and $587,000, respectively.
Our Markets
We operate in five primary markets: Arizona, California, Florida, Metro New York, and Texas. The following table sets forth homebuilding and other revenue from each of these markets for the years indicated (in thousands): 

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020
Arizona | $ | 317,160 | | | $ | 340,767 | | $ | 320,691
California | 503,832 | | | 557,182 | | | 413,917
Florida | 474,779 | | | 93,632 | | | — 
Metro New York | 111,423 | | | — | | | — 
Texas | 39,255 | | | 31,723 | | | — 
Total | $ | 1,446,449 | | | $ | 1,023,304 | | $ | 734,608

The Arizona market consists primarily of entry-level and first-time move-up, single-family homes in Avondale, Buckeye, Chandler, Goodyear, Mesa, Phoenix, Queen Creek, Surprise, and Tolleson.
The California market consists of single-family detached and attached homes in (i) Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Joaquin, and Santa Clara counties in Northern California and (ii) Los Angeles, Orange, and San Bernardino counties in Southern California.
Landsea Homes Corp. | 2022 Form 10-K | 5


The Florida market consists primarily of entry-level and move-up communities of single-family homes and attached homes in high-growth metro Orlando and Palm Bay in Florida.
The New York Metro market consists of a premier condominium project in the Chelsea neighborhood in New York City, New York. 
The Texas market consists of single-family homes and a master-planned community around San Antonio and Austin.
These markets are generally characterized by high job growth and increasing populations, creating strong demand for new housing, and we believe they represent attractive homebuilding markets with opportunities for long-term growth. Moreover, our management team has deep market knowledge of the local homebuilding and development industries. We believe this experience and strong relationships with local market participants enable us to efficiently source, entitle, and close on land.
Our Competitive Strengths 
Our primary business objective is to create long-term, above industry average returns for our stockholders through our commitment to securing growth-oriented land positions and providing High Performance Homes to our customers. We believe that the following strengths differentiate us from other public company homebuilders and position us well to execute our business strategy and capitalize on opportunities across our footprint.
Attractive Land Positions Focused on High Growth Areas
We have positioned our business to strategically grow by selecting markets with favorable population and employment growth as a result of proximity to job centers or primary transportation corridors. Currently, we are focused on the design, construction, and sale of innovative single-family detached and attached homes in planned communities in major metropolitan areas in Arizona, California, and Florida, with expanding operations in Texas. Additionally, we plan to evaluate opportunities in other markets opportunistically.
Generally, we believe that we have strong land positions strategically located within our core markets. We select communities in markets across the United States with high demand and convenient access to metropolitan areas that are generally characterized by a robust local economy and continued job growth that attract new residents and provide opportunities for potential homebuyers.
Strong Operational Discipline
Our management team possesses significant operating expertise, gleaned from its experiences with other public and private homebuilders. The perspective gained from that experience has helped shape the strict discipline and hands-on approach with which we are managed. From real-time “dashboard” updates on each project to monthly operating committee review and financial accountability at the project management level, our strict operating discipline is a key part of our strategy to maximize returns while minimizing risk.
High Performance Homes
We are committed to sustainability. We place heavy emphasis on environmental protection and are committed to delivering comfortable and eco-friendly residential properties to the market. We are committed to sustainable building practices and conduct multiple energy-efficient, sustainable, and environmentally-friendly practices that result in a lighter environmental impact, lower resource consumption and a reduced carbon footprint.
In 2019, Landsea Homes officially launched the High Performance Homes program in select communities across California and Arizona and expanded to communities in Florida in 2022. The program focuses on home automation, sustainability, energy savings, and enabling a healthy lifestyle, four factors that we believe are highly desired by our customers.
Landsea Homes Corp. | 2022 Form 10-K | 6


As part of the High Performance Homes program, we have established a relationship with a leading technology company. High Performance Homes utilize that company’s proprietary software, which offers home automation options through applications on homebuyers’ mobile phones. Smart home automation options include a media manager device, MeshNet wireless internet throughout the home, entry door locks, thermostat control, garage door opener control, light dimmer switches, doorbell camera pre-wiring, and high-touch customer service with an individualized training session.
In addition, each High Performance Home includes upgraded roof, wall, and floor insulation, as well as more efficient mechanical systems, ENERGY STAR® rated appliances, and LED lighting. The cost-in-use features lower homebuyers’ monthly bills and are intended to encourage environmental awareness and stewardship. Other features central to our High Performance Homes, like state-of-the-art air purifiers, promote and enable homebuyer’ pursuits to living a healthy lifestyle.
Our Growth Strategies 
Building upon our success to date, we see a significant opportunity to drive long-term growth across our business by executing on the following growth strategies:
Strategy and Lot Position
Landsea Homes owned approximately 5,300 lots and had options to purchase approximately 6,300 additional lots as of December 31, 2022. We intend to continue to utilize our current inventory of lots and future land acquisitions to conduct our operating strategy, which consists of:
•converting our lot supply into active projects;
•maximizing revenue at communities;
•maintaining a low cost structure;
•acquiring land positions through disciplined acquisition strategies in key markets;
•leveraging an experienced management team;
•gaining access to growth capital while keeping a conservative leverage profile; and
•generating positive cash flows.
Acquire Attractive Land Positions While Reducing Risk
We believe that our reputation and extensive relationships with land sellers, master plan developers, financial institutions, brokers, and other builders will enable us to continue to acquire well-positioned land parcels in our target markets. Before contracting to acquire land, we complete our land acquisition process, which consists of performing due diligence, reviewing the status of entitlements to mitigate zoning and other development risk, and focusing on land as a component of a home’s cost structure, rather than on the land’s speculative value.
We believe that our expertise in land development and planning enables us to create desirable communities that meet or exceed our target customer’s expectations, while operating at competitive costs. We also seek to minimize our exposure to land risk through disciplined management of entitlements, as well as the use of land options and other flexible land acquisition arrangements.
We believe that there are significant opportunities to expand in our existing and target markets, and we continually review our selection of markets based on both aggregate demographic information and our own operating results. We use the results of these reviews to reallocate our investments to maximize our profitability and return on capital over a two to three year timeframe. Our growth strategy will focus on increasing our market position in our existing markets and exploring expansion into other markets through organic growth or acquisitions.
Offer a Diverse Range of Products with a Focus on Entry-Level and First-Time Move-Up Homes
We have construction expertise across an extensive product offering which allows us flexibility to pursue a wide array of land acquisition opportunities and appeal to a broad spectrum of potential homebuyers. We spend 
Landsea Homes Corp. | 2022 Form 10-K | 7


extensive time studying and designing our products through the use of architects, consultants, and homeowner focus groups in our target markets. 
Our primary focus is on entry-level and first-time move-up homes where our attached and higher density products enable us to keep our entry-level price point more affordable and within reach of more new homebuyers. We believe that bringing attainable housing products helps to counter rising land and home costs and support our expansion into densely populated markets. We believe our high concentration in entry level and first-time move-up homes positions us to meet changing market conditions and to optimize returns while strategically reducing portfolio risk. 
 Focus on Efficient Cost Structure and Target Attractive Returns
We believe that our homebuilding platform and focus on controlling costs position us well to generate attractive returns for our investors. Our experienced management team is vigilant in maintaining its focus on controlling costs. We competitively bid each phase of development while maintaining strong relationships with our trade partners by managing production schedules closely and paying our vendors on time.
We combine decentralized management in those aspects of our business where we believe detailed knowledge of local market conditions is critical (such as governmental processing, construction, land development, accounts payable, and sales and marketing), with centralized management in those functions where we believe central control is required (such as approval of land acquisitions, finance, accounting, treasury, human resources, and legal matters). We have also made significant investments in systems and infrastructure to operate our business efficiently and to support our planned future growth as a result of executing our expansion strategy.
Business acquisitions
Along with growing organically through land purchases, construction, and home delivery, we have grown in larger steps by acquiring other homebuilders. Our criteria for such acquisitions includes: a cultural fit that can become a part of our business as a whole, a strong presence in desirable markets to either expand our footprint or deepen our position in the region, an effective local management team who can help the acquisition immediately grow our business, and long-term opportunities to continue to expand our business in the region. We will continue to evaluate future opportunities for business acquisitions as these criteria are met.
Pending Land Acquisitions 
As of December 31, 2022, Landsea Homes had options to acquire or were under contract to acquire land for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $620.2 million, net of deposits, on which we expect to build approximately 6,300 homes in approximately 40 communities across the markets in which we operate. As of December 31, 2022, Landsea Homes had paid $98.4 million in deposits relating to these pending acquisitions of which $97.6 million was nonrefundable. We utilize option contracts with land sellers and others as a method of acquiring land in staged takedowns, to help manage the financial and market risk associated with land holdings, and to reduce the use of funds from financing sources.
Land Acquisition Process 
As of December 31, 2022, Landsea Homes owned or controlled approximately 104 communities containing approximately 11,600 lots under various stages of development. We believe that our current inventory of lots owned and lots controlled under land option or purchase contracts will be adequate to supply our homebuilding operations for approximately three to four years.
Our acquisition strategy focuses on the development of entitled parcels that we can complete within approximately two to three years from the start of sales in order to reduce development and market cycle risk while maintaining an inventory of owned lots and lots under land option or purchase contracts sufficient for construction of homes over a three to four-year period. Our acquisition process generally includes the following steps, which may include the engagement of outside consultants, to reduce development and market cycle risk:
Landsea Homes Corp. | 2022 Form 10-K | 8


•review of the status of entitlements and other governmental processing, including title review;
•review of limitations on the size of an acquisition to minimize investment levels in any one project;
•completion of due diligence on the land parcel and/or holding entity prior to committing to the acquisition;
•preparation of detailed budgets for major cost categories;
•completion of environmental reviews and third-party market studies;
•utilization of options, joint ventures, mergers, equity purchases, and other acquisition arrangements, if necessary; and
•employment of centralized control of approval over all acquisitions through a land committee process.
We acquire land parcels pursuant to purchase agreements, many of which are structured as option contracts. Such option contracts require us to pay non-refundable deposits, which can vary by transaction, and entitle (but do not obligate) us to acquire the land, typically at fixed prices. The term within which we can exercise our option varies by transaction and the acquisition is often contingent upon the completion of entitlement or other work with regard to the land (which often include “backbone” improvements, such as the installation of main roads or sewer mains). Depending upon the transaction, we may be required to purchase all of the land subject to the option at once or we may have a right to acquire identified groups of lots over a specified timetable. In some transactions, a portion of the consideration that we pay for the land may be in the form of a profit share, which would be triggered upon exceeding an agreed-upon level of profit. In limited instances, such as where we acquire land from a master developer that is part of a larger project, the seller may have repurchase rights entitling it to repurchase the land if we do not develop the land by an outside deadline (unless the delay is caused by certain circumstances outside our control) or seek to sell the land directly to a third party or indirectly through a change in control. Repurchase rights typically allow the seller to repurchase the land at our acquisition cost plus the cost of improvements made to the land and less a specified discount.
Sales and Marketing 
We market homes through the extensive use of advertising and other promotional activities, including our website, in-house sales teams, digital media advertisements, brochures, email marketing, and the placement of signboards in the immediate areas of developments.
We normally build, decorate, furnish and landscape model homes for each community floorplan offering and maintain on-site model home sales offices, which typically are open seven days a week. We believe that model homes and sales offices play a particularly important role in our marketing efforts. Consequently, we expend a significant amount of effort to create an attractive atmosphere at our model homes and tailor the exteriors and interiors of each home to coincide with the lifestyles of targeted homebuyers.
We employ in-house commissioned sales personnel and outside brokers to sell our homes. In-house sales personnel typically work from sales offices located in model homes close to or in each community. Sales counselors assist potential buyers by providing them with floor plans, price information, development and construction timetables, tours of model homes and the selection of options. Sales counselors are licensed by the applicable real estate bodies in their respective markets and are trained by Landsea Homes. It is not required but preferred to have had prior experience selling new homes in the local market.
We also offer a virtual sales experience, which provides potential home shoppers with an experience that combines a variety of online tools, including 360° virtual tours, photo galleries, videos, interactive floor plans, interactive community site maps and local vicinity maps. We employ a team of dedicated inside sales counselors that support each division and community web leads, phone calls, and on-site appointments, seven days a week. 
In addition, our High Performance Homes are equipped with a proprietary software from a leading technology company, which offers home automation features through the Homekit® application to use on homebuyers’ personal mobile phones or tablets.
Our homes are typically sold before or during construction through sales contracts accompanied by an earnest money deposit. Such sales contracts are usually subject to certain contingencies such as the buyer’s ability to 
Landsea Homes Corp. | 2022 Form 10-K | 9


qualify for financing. The cancellation rate of buyers who contracted to buy a home from us but did not close escrow was approximately 26.4% during 2022 and 9.0% during 2021. Cancellations are caused by a variety of factors beyond our control such as a buyer’s change in ability to secure financing over time, individual life changing events, or overall economic market conditions. We have seen our cancellation rates increase over the last half of 2022 primarily due to the increase in mortgage rates.
Customer Financing 
In July 2022, we entered into a licensing agreement with NFM Lending, a third party, wherein it will provide mortgage services under the name Landsea Mortgage. NFM Lending is currently licensed in 48 states and will be responsible for the financing of home loans.
Landsea Mortgage, powered by NFM Lending, assists our homebuyers in obtaining financing to offer qualified buyers a variety of financing options. Unlike some other homebuilders, we do not offer residential mortgages or other financing alternatives, whether directly or through any of our joint ventures. We offer financing incentives to our homebuyers when they use Landsea Mortgage. This affords us full collaboration and insight from contract to close to ensure a successful close of escrow.
The Landsea Mortgage team works closely with each division to understand the market demand and buyer demographics to ensure we are offering financing options and incentives competitive in each community. These financing incentives range from closing cost assistance, extended rate locks, and loan interest rate buydowns. The financing incentive amounts vary by market and community.
In connection with the NFM Lending licensing agreement, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into the First Amendment to the Trademark License Agreement, as licensees, with Landsea Group Co., Ltd. (“Landsea Group”), as licensor, pursuant to which, among other things, Landsea Group granted us and certain of our subsidiaries the right to sublicense the “Landsea” trademark in the “domestic homebuilding business,” which now expressly includes “mortgage lending,” “title insurance,” “home insurance” and other “settlement services”.
Quality Control and Customer Service 
We strive to provide a high level of customer service throughout the entire sales process and after a home has closed escrow. All homeowners are surveyed through a homebuyer survey company, Eliant, 30 days, 6 months, and one year after the close of escrow. Each survey summarizes key measurements of the homebuyer experience, construction process, and trade quality into our customer care process. All sales counselors, design associates, mortgage associates, on-site construction supervisors, and the post-closing customer service personnel, work in a team effort to foster our reputation for quality and service and ultimately strive for the highest level of customer home-buying experience that will benefit not only the customer directly, but also benefit us in improving buyer satisfaction and homeowner referrals.
Warranty Program 
We provide our homebuyers with a limited warranty, covering workmanship and materials. The limited warranty varies based on the location of the project and market conditions. The limited warranty is transferable to subsequent buyers not under direct contract with us and requires that homebuyers agree to the terms and procedures set forth in the warranty, including binding arbitration.
We also maintain general liability insurance coverage which we believe will respond to construction claims for the duration of our legal liability, upon satisfaction of applicable deductibles or self-insured retentions. In California, we maintain wrap-up insurance that typically includes project owners, contractors and subcontractors as the insured. As a result, we do not require our California subcontractors to name the Company as an additional insured on their general liability policies for their work on our projects. However, the subcontractors must provide proof of general liability insurance for off-site work, worker’s compensation and auto coverage. Furthermore, we generally require that each subcontractor and design professional provide us with an indemnity, subject to various limitations. In Arizona, Florida, and Texas, subcontractors and design professionals who work on our projects 
Landsea Homes Corp. | 2022 Form 10-K | 10


provide indemnity and name the Company as additional insured on the insurance policies. We also maintain excess liability insurance in these jurisdictions in addition to warranty reserves based on our historical market experience and judgment of the risks associated with conditions particular to each location. 
There can be no assurance, however, that the terms and limitations of the limited warranty will be enforceable, that we will be able to renew our insurance coverage or renew it at reasonable rates, that we will not be liable for damages, costs of repairs and/or expenses of litigation for claims for which insurance and/or indemnity is not applicable and/or collectible. We may also be responsible for deductibles or self-insured retentions and claims may exceed applicable coverage limits. Although we actively monitor our reserves, coverage issues and market conditions, because of the inherent uncertainties outlined above, we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage, indemnities, warranty arrangements, and reserves will be adequate to address all construction-related claims in the future. Additionally, under current market conditions, general liability insurance for construction claims is limited and costly. It is expected that such coverage may become more restricted and costly in the future.
Raw Materials 
Typically, raw materials and most of the components used in our business are readily available in the United States. Most are standard items carried by major suppliers. However, a rapid increase in the number of homes started or other market conditions could cause delays in the delivery of, shortages in, or higher prices for necessary materials. Delivery delays or the inability to obtain necessary materials, such as what we experienced in 2021 and parts of 2022 as a result of supply chain issues, have resulted in delays in the delivery of homes under construction. We have established national and regional purchase programs for certain materials and will continue to monitor the supply markets to achieve competitive pricing.
Intellectual Property 
We rely on a combination of trademark and copyright law, trade-secret protection, confidentiality, nondisclosure, license agreements and/or other contractual provisions, and technical measures with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. We also use the “Landsea” trademark pursuant to an exclusive license and its terms as granted under the Trademark License Agreement. While all of these proprietary rights are important to our operations, we do not consider any particular trademark, license, franchise, or concession to be material to our overall business. 
Sale of Lots and Land 
In the ordinary course of business, we continually evaluate land sales opportunities. We have sold and expect that we will continue to sell land as market and business conditions warrant. We may also sell lots to other builders, unfinished homes to rental companies, and improved individual lots for the construction of custom homes where the presence of such homes adds to the quality of the community. In addition, in the future we may acquire sites with commercial, industrial, and multi-family parcels which will generally be sold to third-party developers.
Information Systems and Controls 
We assign a high priority to the development and maintenance of our budget and cost control systems and procedures. Through our fully integrated accounting, financial and operational management information system, management regularly evaluates the status of our projects in relation to budgets to determine the cause of any variances and, where appropriate, adjusts our operations to capitalize on favorable variances or to limit adverse financial impacts.
Regulation 
We and our competitors are subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, building design, construction, and similar matters, including local regulation which imposes restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can ultimately be 
Landsea Homes Corp. | 2022 Form 10-K | 11


built within the boundaries of a particular project. We and our competitors may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or “slow-growth” or “no-growth” initiatives that could be implemented in the future in the states in which we operate. Because we usually purchase entitled land, we believe that the moratoriums would adversely affect us only if they arose from unforeseen health, safety, and welfare issues such as insufficient water or sewage facilities. Local and state governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees for projects in their jurisdiction. However, these are normally locked-in when we receive entitlements.
We and our competitors are also subject to a variety of local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment. The particular environmental laws which apply to any given community vary greatly according to the community site, the site’s environmental conditions and the present and former uses of the site. These environmental laws may result in delays, cause us and our competitors to incur substantial compliance and other costs and prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas. Environmental laws and regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials such as lumber. Our projects in California and New York are especially susceptible to restrictive government regulations and environmental laws. California, for example, includes a ten-year, strict liability tail on many construction liability claims and imposes notification obligations regarding environmental conditions, sometimes recorded on deeds, and also those required to be delivered to persons accessing property or to home buyers or renters, which may cause some persons, or their financing sources, to view the subject parcels as less valuable or as impaired. However, environmental laws have not, to date, had a material adverse impact on our operations.
Competition 
The homebuilding industry is highly competitive and fragmented. While our competitors vary by market, we compete directly with major national builders such as KB Home, Lennar Corporation, Tri Pointe Homes, Inc., PulteGroup, Inc., and D.R. Horton, Inc. Homebuilders compete for, among other things, homebuyers, desirable land parcels, financing, raw materials, and skilled labor. We compete for homebuyers on the basis of a number of interrelated factors including home design and location, construction quality, customer service and satisfaction, and reputation. We believe that we compete effectively in our existing markets as a result of our product differentiation through our High Performance Home platform, geographic diversity, and substantial development expertise. Further, we believe that we are adept at acquiring and integrating existing homebuilders based on our recent acquisition history, allowing us to grow both organically and via acquisition.
Seasonality 
Our operations are historically seasonal, with the highest new order activity typically occurring in the spring and summer, although this is impacted by the timing of project openings and competition in surrounding projects, among other factors. In addition, a majority of our home deliveries typically occur in the third and fourth quarter of each fiscal year, based on the construction cycle times of our homes. As a result, our revenues, cash flow, and profitability are higher in that same period. We expect this seasonal pattern to continue over the long-term, although it may be affected by volatility in the homebuilding industry.
Employees and Human Capital Resources 
We believe that we maintain strong relations with our employees. Some employees of the subcontractors we utilize are unionized, but none of our employees are unionized.
Number of Employees. As of December 31, 2022, Landsea Homes employed 458 employees, including corporate staff, supervisory personnel of construction projects, warranty service personnel for completed projects, as well as persons engaged in administrative, finance and accounting, human resources, legal, and sales and marketing activities. 454 of these employees were full-time employees.
Landsea Homes Corp. | 2022 Form 10-K | 12


Retention and Turnover. We focus significant attention on attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations, and our management team routinely reviews employee turnover rates at various levels of the organization. As of December 31, 2022, with a 12-month lookback period, Landsea Homes had a voluntary turnover rate of approximately 27.7%. 
Internal Promotion and Compensation. Every year, each manager helps set his or her employees’ professional goals for internal promotion, and monitors employees’ progress throughout the year. Employee compensation is determined based on industry benchmarks and cost of living factors. Bonus incentives are primarily paid out annually based on division performance goals. We recommend and promote continuing education for all employees, and offer tuition reimbursement for job-related curriculum.
Employee Productivity. Senior management works with department level leads to appropriately tailor and establish annual, quarterly, and monthly goals, depending on position. These metrics are actively monitored via the use of third-party service providers and internal workflow programs. In addition, division level leads regularly meet with staff on a weekly basis to discuss workplace metrics. We also utilize a number of third-party services providers to track employee metrics.
Worker Safety and Compliance with Laws. We actively train our employees and management on workplace safety and related laws and regulations. With respect to workplace safety, we utilize a third-party vendor to ensure compliance with California/Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and federal OSHA safety requirements. Internally, we have a formal safety committee that meets quarterly to review employee safety protocols.

Business Combination with LF Capital Acquisition Corp. 
On August 31, 2020, Landsea Homes and its parent, Landsea Holdings, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with LF Capital Acquisition Corp. (“LF Capital”) and LFCA Merger Sub, Inc. (the “Merger Sub”), a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of LF Capital. The Merger Agreement provided for, among other things, the merger of Merger Sub with and into Landsea Homes Incorporated (“LHI”), previously a wholly-owned subsidiary of Landsea Holdings, with LHI continuing as the surviving corporation (the “Merger”). 
On January 7, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), the Merger was consummated pursuant to the Merger Agreement (the “Closing”). The name of LF Capital was changed at that time to Landsea Homes Corporation. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Landsea Holdings received $343.8 million of stock consideration, consisting of 32.6 million newly issued shares of Landsea Homes Corporation’s common stock. The shares were valued at $10.56 per share for purposes of determining the aggregate number of shares payable to Landsea Holdings (the “Stock Consideration”). 
Implications of Being a Smaller Reporting Company 
We qualify as a smaller reporting company (“smaller reporting company”), as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). We may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of these scaled disclosures for so long as (i) our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter or (ii) our annual revenue is less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter.
