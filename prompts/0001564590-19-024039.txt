 Item 1. Business
 ABOUT KORN FERRY
 Korn Ferry (referred to herein as the “Company” or in the first person notations “we,” “our,” and “us”) is a global organizational consulting firm, synchronizing our clients’ strategy and talent to drive superior business performance. 
 We operate in 104 offices in 52 countries, enabling us to deliver our solutions on a global basis, wherever our clients do business. As of April 30, 2019, we had 8,678 full-time employees, including 1,448 consultants who are primarily responsible for originating client services. 
 During fiscal 2019, we partnered with 13,834 client organizations. Our clients include many of the world’s largest and most prestigious public and private companies, middle market and emerging growth companies, as well as government and nonprofit organizations, including 98% of the Fortune 100 and 93% of the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100. We have built strong client loyalty, with 90% of our engagements in fiscal 2019 being completed on behalf of clients for whom we had conducted engagements in the previous three fiscal years. 
 We have made significant investments in our business that have strengthened our intellectual property (“IP”), enhanced our geographical presence, added complementary offerings to deepen client relationships and broadened our capabilities around talent acquisition, organizational strategy, assessment, development and rewards. Approximately 70% of our revenue comes from clients that utilize multiple lines of our business.
 We were originally formed as a California corporation in November 1969 and reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in fiscal 2000.
 On June 12, 2018, the Board of Directors of Korn Ferry approved a plan (the “Plan”) to go to market under a single, master brand architecture and to simplify the Company’s organizational structure by eliminating and/or consolidating certain legal entities and implementing a rebranding of the Company to offer the Company’s current products and services using the “Korn Ferry” name, branding and trademarks. In connection with the Plan, (i) the Company has sunset all sub-brands, including Futurestep, Hay Group and Lominger, among others, and (ii) effective as of January 1, 2019, the Company has been renamed “Korn Ferry.” The Company is continuing to harmonize under one brand to help the firm position itself as a preeminent organizational consulting firm and bring more client awareness to its broad range of talent management solutions. While the rebranding has not impacted the Company’s segment financial reporting, the Company renamed its Hay Group segment as Advisory and its Futurestep segment as RPO & Professional Search. The Company’s Executive Search segment name remains unchanged.
 We file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Our reports, proxy statements and other documents filed electronically with the SEC are available at the website maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov.
 We also make available, free of charge on the Investor Relations portion of our website at http://ir.kornferry.com, our annual, quarterly, and current reports, and, if applicable, amendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such reports with, or furnish them to, the SEC at www.sec.gov.
 We also make available on the Investor Relations portion of our website at http://ir.kornferry.com press releases and related earnings presentations and other important information, which we encourage you to review.

 THE KORN FERRY OPPORTUNITY
 Aligned around our vision to be the preeminent organizational consulting firm, we are pursuing an ambitious strategy that will help us to focus relentlessly on clients and collaborate intensively across the organization. This approach builds on the best of our past and gives us a clear path to the future with focused initiatives to increase our client and commercial impact.
 Korn Ferry is transforming how clients address their talent management needs. We have evolved from a mono-line business to a global organizational consulting firm, giving our consultants more frequent and expanded opportunities to engage with clients.

While most organizations can develop a sound strategy, they often struggle with how to make it stick. That is where we come in: synchronizing an organization’s strategy with its talent to drive superior performance. We help companies design their organization—the structure, roles and responsibilities—to seize these opportunities. In addition, we help organizations select and hire the talent they need to execute their strategy—and show them the best way to compensate, develop and motivate their people. 
 We do this through our five core solution sets:
 Core Solutions
 
 
Organizational Strategy | We map talent strategy to business strategy by designing operating models and organizational structures that align to them, helping organizations put their plans into action. We make sure they have the right people, in the right roles, engaged and enabled to do the right things. 
--------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assessment and Succession | We provide actionable, research-backed insights that allow organizations to understand the true capabilities of their people so they can make decisions that ensure the right leaders are ready—when and where they are needed—now and in the future. 
Talent Acquisition | From executive search to recruitment process outsourcing, we integrate scientific research with our practical experience and industry-specific expertise to recruit professionals of all levels and functions for client organizations. 
Leadership Development | We help leaders at all levels of an organization achieve their vision, purpose and strategy. We combine expertise, science and proven techniques with forward thinking and creativity to build leadership experiences that help entry to senior level leaders grow and deliver superior results.
Rewards and Benefits | We help organizations design rewards to achieve their strategic objectives. We help them pay their people fairly for doing the right things—with rewards they value—at a cost the organization can afford. 

Integrated Solutions
 Additionally, we deliver differentiated approaches for our clients through our integrated market offerings, which bring together our best thinking from across our core solutions. These offerings target specific client needs, guided by an ever-changing business environment. 
 One such strategic growth area is transaction services related to mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and divestitures. A key differentiator with this service is our ability to help organizations drive growth by aligning leadership, talent and culture to the investment thesis during the integration process—from the C-suite through all employee levels. We also help companies develop and execute cost optimization strategies around rewards, organization design and workforce planning, to prepare them for potential market volatility. 
 Other integrated offerings focus on our clients’ transformational challenges. Our digital transformation service helps clients execute on a digital operating model, including the introduction and integration of new agile ways of working. Rich proprietary data enables our clients to better deliver the right value proposition to attract, retain and engage digital talent. In addition, we help specific functional areas, such as HR, develop their future-state model within a digital environment. 
 Our diversity and inclusion (“D&I”) service helps clients innovate and grow by creating an inclusive culture and diverse workforce. Organizations are in different places on their D&I journeys, ranging from compliance-driven, values-driven, talent performance driven, and beyond. Therefore, we combine our insights into a single offering that can be tailored to different markets and buyers.
 From core through integrated, across our solution portfolio, we have the advantage of best-in-class solutions, products and talent, coupled with deep market expertise, to deliver a seamless approach to organization, talent and rewards strategies. Our change management capabilities further support our clients, through the successful execution of their transformational strategies and the effective implementation of their people and culture programs.
 OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND TECHNOLOGY
 We know what good looks like: We bring together the industry knowledge, assessments, and data to benchmark clients against the best. We offer a complete view of the talent they need and the talent they have. We know if their rewards are fair and effective. And we align their structures, role profiles, and people to support the strategy so that clients know where to focus their efforts to create lasting change in the organization.

The Talent Hub
 At the core of our approach is deep IP and research that allows us to deliver meaningful business outcomes for our clients. We house all of this data inside our Talent Hub. With more than four billion data points in total, including 69 million assessments, profiles of eight million candidates, rewards data on 20 million professionals and engagement data on more than seven million professionals, our Talent Hub is the science-based engine that uses this rich data set to fuel all of our services, solutions and products, connecting dots to drive meaningful change. 
Advanced Analytics
 Core IP data and assets include proprietary leadership assessment, recruitment and development models, emotional and social competencies, human motives and values, job grading, engagement and rewards systems. We integrate and build upon our data sets using advanced modeling and artificial intelligence (“AI”) to produce predictive insights and deliver demonstrable client impact.
The Korn Ferry Institute
 The Korn Ferry Institute, our research and analytics arm, unites three areas: agile client execution; applied research and analytics; and breakthrough innovation. These teams work together to help business and public-sector leaders understand the key trends and drivers of human and organizational performance, so that they make better, science-based decisions on critical leadership, people, management and policy issues. 
 At the highest level, the Korn Ferry Institute explores three themes: 
  
1. | People, organization and technology innovation;
---+------------------------------------------------


2. | Data analytics for human and business performance; and
---+-------------------------------------------------------


3. | New demographic trends.
---+------------------------

 In the fiscal year ahead, we will continue to innovate and simplify our IP for greater leverage of our data set, driving even greater business impact.
 INDUSTRY TRENDS
 In this competitive global economic environment, our clients are seeking new pathways to drive operational excellence and superior performance outcomes. This trend is attractive to our sector, as organizations are increasingly turning to partners like Korn Ferry to synchronize their strategy with their talent as an answer to today’s most pressing business challenges, specifically:

▪ | Achieving growth and cost synergies from M&A transactions without destroying employee engagement.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Having the right people, mindsets and structures to achieve successful digital transformations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Managing potential market volatility by reducing cost in their reward structures and workforce mix.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Creating cultures of inclusion where diversity is intrinsically valued; where every individual is able to contribute fully; and where all talented people can advance through the organization regardless of their gender, background or other identifying factors.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Changing ingrained ways of thinking and building strategies that energize employees and drive performance in the face of disruptive change.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Improving the quality of service delivery in core functions to create strategic competitive advantage.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, we believe the following factors will have a long-term positive impact on our industry:
  
▪ | Companies are actively in search of trusted advisors that can offer a full suite of organizational consulting products and solutions, to manage the multiple needs of their business on a global scale using a common language.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Over the next decade, demand for skilled workers will outstrip supply, resulting in a global talent shortage. Organizations must make talent strategy a key priority and take steps now to educate, train, and upskill their existing workforces.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 3

 
▪ | Companies are increasingly leveraging big data and predictive analytics to measure the influence of activities across all aspects of their business, including their people. They expect their partners to deliver superior metrics and better ways of driving results.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | There is an increasing demand for professionals with not just the right experience, but also the right leadership competencies, traits and drivers to meet the requirements of the position and organizational culture today and prepare it for tomorrow.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Executive management tenure continues to hover at historically low levels.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | The balance of power is shifting from the employer to the employee, as more people take charge of their own careers and the gig economy continues to grow in popularity.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Talent mobility is being recognized as a critical driver in the recruitment, development and retention of an organization’s people, particularly their early career professionals.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Succession planning remains under heightened scrutiny amidst pressure to generate growth, shorter CEO tenures and the emphasis being placed on making succession planning a systemic governance process within global organizations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Executive pay is under a perpetual spotlight, making it imperative that organizations get this right to ensure the public trust and establish a functional compensation strategy that starts right at the top.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Companies are more determined than ever to close the gender gap on pay and advancement to leadership roles.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | More companies are maintaining strategic focus by choosing to outsource non-core functions like talent acquisition to RPO providers who can offer efficient, high-quality services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GROWTH STRATEGY 
 Our objective is to expand our position as the preeminent organizational consulting firm. In order to meet this objective, we will continue to pursue our multi-pronged strategy: 
Drive a One Korn Ferry Go-to-Market Strategy
 Our synergistic go-to-market strategy, bringing together our core solutions, is driving more integrated, scalable client relationships. This is evidenced by the fact that approximately 70% of our revenues come from clients that utilize multiple lines of our business. Additionally, our Net Promoter Score, a metric used to gauge customer loyalty, has increased by three points compared to last year. To better compete in the market, we will continue to evolve from our traditional line of business segmentation to integrated solutions and industries.
 Our Marquee Accounts program is a core pillar of our go-to-market strategy. This program drives major global and regional strategic account development, in addition to providing a framework for all our client development activities as we move our firm to deeper client relationships. Our Marquee Accounts program now comprises 21% of our global fee revenues. In the year ahead, we will continue to grow and expand our account management activities. This includes driving consistent account selection, assignment, planning and execution; implementing account-based marketing efforts; optimizing the pipeline and opportunity process; integrating our best thinking across solutions; and hiring additional dedicated account leaders. We will also expand this successful go-to-market program to the next level of accounts—our Regional Accounts program.
 Another pillar of our growth strategy is the Products business. In fiscal 2019, product sales comprised 31% of our Advisory revenue. Our subscription services delivered online help us generate long-term relationships with our clients through large scale and technology-based human resources (“HR”) programs. We continue to seek ways to further scale these highly profitable products to our global clients.
 Deliver Client Excellence and Innovation
 Technology is positioned to reshape the future of work and with it, the workforce as we know it today. Market innovations contribute to more accurate, faster, cost-effective and impactful business and human decisions. Our firm is well positioned in that context. We have a set of assets that are critical to such decisions: deep science on organization and human motivation, data on talent, work and rewards, and proven products and solutions.

We are combining our IP and technology into a unified single platform to allow clients to make faster, better talent decisions. Our IP-driven tools and services are being utilized by our clients for everything from organizational development and job profiling to selection, training, individual and team development, succession planning, M&A, D&I, digital transformation and more. 
 Enhancements to our Talent Hub platform, including Korn Ferry Listen, Assess, Perform and Pay, will allow us to embed analytics directly into our clients’ user experience, providing actionable insights. In fiscal 2019, we collaborated with experience management (XM) software leader Qualtrics, whereby Korn Ferry is building a global delivery and advisory service to improve employee experience programs at scale. 
 New Offerings—More than 63,000 consumers have registered and are using Korn Ferry Advance, our new business-to-consumer offering, since it launched in the United States (the “U.S.”) in July 2017. We are expanding and enhancing the offering to provide more focused assistance to people looking to make their next career move, as well as to provide tailored career services to an organization’s people. Korn Ferry Advance will continue to leverage cutting-edge technology as well as the greatest asset we have—our consultants. Korn Ferry Advance is also being used to augment our Korn Ferry Advisory offerings, primarily in Leadership Development and Coaching.
 Create the Top-of-Mind Brand in Organizational Consulting
 Next to our people, the Korn Ferry brand is the strongest asset of the Company. Positioning Korn Ferry as the preeminent global organizational consultancy and demonstrating our ability to drive business performance through people remains the goal of our global marketing program.
 The Korn Ferry brand is brought to market via two distinct channels: business-to-business (“B2B”) and business-to-consumer (“B2C”). In both instances, we communicate key core values about what we do, expressing that we are ‘more than’ as well as inspiring action in the way our customers run their businesses and in the way they approach their careers. We are executing against our strategy with these priorities in mind:
  
▪ | One Korn Ferry—We will partner with internal and external stakeholders to advance a differentiated one Korn Ferry story and brand that minimizes operational risks, engages our employees, resonates in the broader market and becomes a platform for differentiation and sustainable growth.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Generate Demand—We will assess market trends, liaise with clients, and partner with internal stakeholders to develop a steady cadence of thought leadership-based, campaigns, public relations and demand generation activities that engage clients and prospects in meaningful conversations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advance Korn Ferry as a Premier Career Destination
 We continue to invest in building a world-class organization that is aligned to our strategy and is staffed by a capable, motivated and agile workforce. A few key initiatives in this area include:

▪ | Onboarding—In fiscal 2019, we increased our headcount by 1,035. To support this growth, we have launched a standardized, global onboarding experience for all Korn Ferry new hires using a common platform, materials and resources to ensure all new hires are effectively integrated into the Company with reduced ramp-up time to full productivity. We are also taking a programmatic approach to onboarding through our Talent Academy and StartUp early career cohort trainings.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Career Paths and Mobility—Under the Korn Ferry enterprise-wide career model, we are defining and will roll out career paths that enable and encourage talent mobility across all areas of our business along with self-directed development. In fiscal 2019, we promoted more than 800 colleagues across our three segments.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Talent Development—Our growth plans require a learning, agile organization. To facilitate this, we use a learning management system (iAcademy) to serve as a Center of Excellence focused on the growth and development of our colleagues through rich, personalized content.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Mentoring—As our firm continues to expand in size and offerings, our colleagues face increasingly complex client and career issues, all while learning how to work together as One Korn Ferry. The need to connect, collaborate and help each other has never been more pronounced. In the year ahead, we will roll out a firm-wide mentorship program to empower our colleagues to learn, connect and advance. Paired through the Korn Ferry Advance platform, Mentors and Mentees will be matched based on proximity and career goals and focus.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Benefits—We are nearing completion of our global benefits harmonization work. We are setting our sights on the next phase of our benefits strategy, which is the modernization and optimization of our benefits programs around the world. We will ensure we have benefits that are culturally relevant, market prevalent and personally impactful. We create balance between cost effectiveness and competitiveness to align with our financial goals and talent strategy.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pursue Transformational Opportunities at the Intersection of Talent and Strategy 
 We have developed a core competency in identifying, acquiring and integrating M&A targets that have the potential to further our strategic objectives and enhance shareholder value. Our disciplined approach to M&A will continue to play a critical role in the ongoing evolution of Korn Ferry into an industry specialized, business outcomes oriented solutions provider at the intersection of talent and strategy. While we will continue to execute on our targeted organic growth pathways, M&A will be a vital component of our future growth and capital deployment strategies.  
 OUR ORGANIZATION
 The Company operates through its three global segments: Executive Search, Advisory, and RPO & Professional Search. Our Executive Search business is managed and reported on a geographic basis throughout four regions: North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), Asia Pacific and Latin America. Advisory and RPO & Professional Search are managed on a global basis with operations in North America, EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America. 
Executive Search 
 Overview—Korn Ferry helps clients attract and hire leaders who fit with their organization and make it stand out. Our services are typically used to fill executive-level positions, such as board directors, chief executive officers, chief financial officers, chief operating officers, chief information officers, chief human resource officers and other senior executive officers. 
 Our Executive Search services concentrate on searches for positions with average annual cash compensation of $360,000 or more, or comparable compensation in foreign locations. The industry is comprised of retained and contingency recruitment firms. Retained firms, such as Korn Ferry, typically charge a fee for their services equal to approximately one-third of the first-year annual cash compensation for the position being filled regardless of whether the position is filled. Contingency firms generally work on a non-exclusive basis and are compensated only upon successfully placing a recommended candidate.
 As part of being retained by a client to conduct a search, we assemble a team of consultants with appropriate geographic, industry and functional expertise. We utilize a standardized and differentiated approach to placing talent that integrates our research-based IP with our practical experience. Our search consultants serve as management advisors who work closely with the client in identifying, assessing and placing qualified candidates. In fiscal 2019, we executed 6,790 new executive search assignments.
 Industry Specialization—Consultants in our six industries bring an in-depth understanding of the market conditions and strategic management issues faced by clients within their specific industries and geographies. We are continually looking to expand our specialized expertise through internal development and strategic hiring in targeted growth areas.

This is a dedicated team from the most senior ranks of the Company. Their work is with CEOs and in the boardroom, and their expertise is organizational leadership and governance.

 Client Base—Our 3,993 Search engagement clients in fiscal 2019 include many of the world’s largest and most prestigious public and private companies. 
 Competition—In Executive Search, we compete with other global executive search firms. Although these firms are our largest competitors, we also compete with smaller boutique firms that specialize in specific regional, industry or functional searches. We believe our brand name, differentiated business model, systematic approach to client service, cutting-edge technology, unique IP, global network, prestigious clientele, strong specialty practices and high-caliber colleagues are recognized worldwide. We also believe our long-term incentive compensation arrangements, as well as other executive benefits, distinguish us from most of our competitors and are important in attracting and retaining our key consultants.
Advisory
 Overview—Korn Ferry helps clients design their organization—the structure, roles and responsibilities—and shows them the best way to compensate, develop and motivate their people. Our focus is on making change happen and helping people and organizations exceed their potential. Through our talented colleagues, robust solutions and intellectual property, our consultants are able to solve the most disruptive and challenging organizational and talent problems facing clients.
 Our Advisory team is comprised of top leadership and organizational advisory consultants and thought leaders, working in 85 cities in 49 countries. Our consultants are predominately recruited from local markets, so they are sensitive to local issues, but work together in global teams, resulting in larger opportunities with greater client and commercial impact.
 We are an advisory leader and many of the world’s most admired organizations choose to partner with us because of our track record delivering successful outcomes, our ability to listen, and our focus on putting our clients first. We accomplish this through a combination of solution, consulting and other products that address how people work and show how to nurture them so that their strategies succeed. We capitalize on the breadth of our IP, service offerings and expertise to do what is right for the client—transforming ideas into actionable insights. Clients can depend on our products and platforms to be data backed, market tested and agile.
 Korn Ferry is known for creating and owning one of the richest and most comprehensive people and pay data sets in the world, including the most widely used job evaluation methodology. We have helped clients assess and develop hundreds of thousands of managers and executives. In addition, we have built a database of organizational management information that enables our clients to benchmark themselves against the best performers in their industries on any multitude of dimensions.

Within Advisory, we offer the following core go-to-market solutions:
 Organizational Strategy: We provide end-to-end support to organizations that want to transform their business. Strategy becomes operationalized by aligning the tangible elements of the organization—people, structure and process—and the intangible elements—motivations, relationships and culture. 
 Assessment and Succession: We provide actionable, research-backed insight and products that allow organizations to understand the talent they have, benchmarked against the talent they need to deliver on the business strategy, and we help them close any gaps.
 Leadership Development: We develop leaders at every stage of the leadership journey, from first time manager to CEO, with a spectrum of high-touch and high-tech leadership development experiences that are tightly aligned with succession and talent processes. Our solutions are backed by tools and techniques that are delivered by hundreds of dedicated leadership development experts across the globe. 
 Rewards and Benefits: We help organizations design rewards to achieve their strategic objectives, to pay their people fairly for doing the right things—with rewards they value—at a cost the organization can afford. Our advice is backed by the quality and quantity of our pay data and widely used job evaluation methodology. 
 These solutions are often bundled into integrated market offerings (e.g., Digital Transformation, M&A) that integrate our best thinking across our solutions, enabling us to develop innovative and differentiated approaches to our clients’ most pressing business challenges. 
 These solutions are also enhanced, enabled and optimized through various products, allowing clients to resolve people challenges consistently and cost effectively. Some are delivered by our accredited experts; others through our powerful digital tools.
 Consulting fee revenue was $568.3 million, $540.5 million and $497.7 million in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This represented 30%, 31% and 32% of the Company’s total fee revenue in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 Products fee revenue was $252.7 million, $244.5 million and $226.5 million in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 Regions—As of April 30, 2019, we had Advisory operations in 23 cities in North America, 33 in EMEA, 20 in Asia Pacific, and 9 in Latin America.
 Client Base—During fiscal 2019, the Advisory segment partnered with approximately 10,000 clients across the globe and 15% of Advisory’s fiscal 2019 fee revenue was referred from Korn Ferry’s Executive Search and RPO & Professional Search segments. Our clients come from the private, public and not-for-profit sectors, across every major industry and represent diverse business challenges.
 Competition—The people and organizational consulting market is extremely competitive, as companies are increasingly seeking ways to synchronize their strategy and talent to drive superior business performance. Our competitors include consulting organizations affiliated with accounting, insurance, information systems, executive search and staffing firms, as well as strategy consulting firms. Although these firms are our largest competitors, we also compete with smaller boutique firms that specialize in specific regional, industry or functional aspects of leadership and HR consulting. 
 Successful strategy implementation is 90% about execution, and successful execution is 90% about getting the people, organization and cultural aspects right. This is where we have an edge over our competition. We focus on making change happen. In a world of constant disruption, it is critical that we build our clients’ capability to keep on changing—embedding it into every consulting project.
 We also believe our products and IP, utilized every day and embedded into the core business processes of the world’s most admired companies, are a major competitive differentiator. 
 RPO & Professional Search
 Overview—Korn Ferry combines people, process expertise and IP enabled technology to deliver enterprise talent acquisition solutions to our clients. Our recruiting solutions have breadth, including all functional talent segments—IT, Marketing, R&D, Commercial Sales, HR, Supply Chain, Finance and Legal. We also have depth, with the ability to deliver transaction sizes ranging from single professional searches to team, department and line of business projects, and enterprise global professional recruiting solutions. Our global capabilities deliver 1-10,000 or more new hires to address our clients’ employment needs.

RPO: In fiscal 2019, Korn Ferry was recognized as a top five RPO provider in the Baker’s Dozen list, marking our 12th consecutive year on the list. Through decades of experience, we have enhanced our RPO solution to deliver quality candidates that drive our clients’ business strategies. We leverage proprietary IP and data sets to guide clients on the critical skills and competencies to look for, compensation Information to align with market demand, and assessment tools to ensure candidate fit. 
 We combine traditional recruitment expertise with a multi-tiered portfolio of talent acquisition solutions. Consultants, based in 30 countries, have access to our databases of pre-screened, mid-level professionals. Our global candidate pool complements our international presence and multi-channel sourcing strategy to provide speed, efficiency and quality service for clients worldwide.
 Project Recruitment: We are able to deliver the same talent acquisition services as we would in an end-to-end RPO solution, but within a defined project start and end date. Our Project Recruitment solution is seamless and aligned with the client’s broader talent acquisition strategy. Clients enjoy the same benefits around reduced time to hire, reduced cost per hire and improved candidate quality that they would with a full RPO solution, but via an on-demand model to manage short-term or specialized needs.
 Professional Search: We are positioned to help organizations identify and attract professionals at the middle to upper levels of management in single-search engagements. We focus on:

Our innovative search process mirrors our Executive Search solution, offering access to active and passive candidate pools, the industry’s richest data on salaries and employee engagement, and proprietary tools such as Four Dimensional Executive Assessment and Executive Snapshot. A wealth of assessment data defines the traits needed for success in each role we recruit and matches candidates against best-in-class profiles while also gauging cultural fit.
 Regions—As of April 30, 2019, we had RPO & Professional Search operations in 13 cities in North America, 13 in EMEA, 18 in Asia Pacific, and 9 in Latin America.
 Client Base—During fiscal 2019, the RPO & Professional Search segment partnered with 2,093 clients across the globe and 44% of RPO & Professional Search’s fiscal 2019 fee revenue was referred from Korn Ferry’s Executive Search and Advisory segments.
 Competition—We primarily compete for RPO business with other global RPO providers and compete for search assignments with regional contingency recruitment firms and large national retained recruitment firms. We believe our competitive advantage is distinct. We are strategic, working with clients to hire best-fit candidates using our assessment IP, proprietary technology and professional recruiters. We also work under the One Korn Ferry umbrella to help clients plan for their broader talent acquisition needs as part of their business strategy planning.
