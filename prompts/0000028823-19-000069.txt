GENERAL

The Company automates, digitizes and transforms the way people bank and shop. The Company’s integrated solutions connect digital and physical channels conveniently, securely and efficiently for millions of consumers every day. As an innovation partner for nearly all of the world's top 100 financial institutions and a majority of the top 25 global retailers, the Company delivers unparalleled services and technology that power the daily operations and consumer experience of banks and retailers around the world. The Company has a presence in more than 100 countries with approximately 23,000 employees worldwide. 
Strategy
The Company seeks to continually enhance the consumer experience at bank and retail locations while simultaneously streamlining cost structures and business processes through the smart integration of hardware, software and services. The Company partners with other leading technology companies and regularly refines its research and development (R&D) spend to support a better transaction experience for consumers.
DN Now Transformation Activities
Commensurate with its strategy, the Company has evolved its multi-year transformation program called DN Now to relentlessly focus on its customers and improve operational excellence. Key activities underway include:

• | Transitioning to a streamlined and customer-centric operating model


• | Implementing a services modernization plan which focuses on upgrading certain customer touchpoints, automating incident reporting and response, and standardizing service offerings and internal processes


• | Streamlining the product range of automated teller machines (ATMs) and manufacturing footprint


• | Improving working capital management through greater focus and efficiency of payables, receivables and inventory


• | Reducing administrative expenses, including finance, information technology (IT) and real estate


• | Increasing sales productivity through improved coverage and compensation arrangements


• | Standardizing back-office processes to automate reporting and better manage risks


• | Optimizing the portfolio of businesses to improve overall profitability

These work streams are designed to improve the Company’s profitability and net leverage while establishing a foundation for future growth. The gross annualized savings target for DN Now is approximately $400 through 2021, of which $160 is anticipated to be realized during 2019. In order to achieve these savings, the Company has and will continue to restructure the workforce, integrate and optimize systems and processes, transition workloads to lower cost locations and consolidate real estate holdings. By executing on these and other operational improvement activities, the Company expects to increase customer intimacy and satisfaction, while providing career enrichment opportunities for employees and enhancing value for shareholders.
CONNECTED COMMERCE SOLUTIONS
The Company’s operating structure is focused on its two customer segments — Banking and Retail. Leveraging a broad portfolio of solutions, the Company offers customers the flexibility to purchase the combination of services, software and systems that drive the most value to their business.
Banking
The Company provides integrated solutions for financial institutions of all sizes designed to help drive operational efficiencies, differentiate the consumer experience, grow revenue and manage risk. Banking operations are managed within two geographic regions. The Eurasia region includes the developed economies of Western Europe as well as the emerging economies of Eastern Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The Americas region encompasses the United States (U.S.), Canada, Mexico and Latin America.
For banking clients, services represents the largest operational component of the Company. Diebold Nixdorf AllConnectSM Services was launched in 2018 to power the business operations of financial institutions of all sizes. This as-a-service offering provides financial institutions with the capabilities and technology needed to make physical distribution channels as agile, integrated, efficient and differentiated as their digital counterparts by leveraging a data-driven Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure. The Company’s product-related services resolve incidents through remote service capabilities or an on-site visit. The portfolio includes first and second line maintenance, preventive maintenance, “on-demand” and total implementation services.

Managed services and outsourcing consists of managing the end-to-end business processes, technology integration and day-to-day operation of the self-service channel and the bank branch. Our integrated business solutions include self-service fleet management, branch life-cycle management and ATM as-a-service capabilities.
From a product perspective, the banking portfolio consists of cash recyclers and dispensers, intelligent deposit terminals, teller automation and kiosk technologies, as well as physical security solutions. The Company assists financial institutions to increase the functionality, availability and security within their ATM fleet. 
The Company’s software encompasses front-end applications for consumer connection points as well as back-end platforms which manage channel transactions, operations and integration. These hardware-agnostic software applications facilitate millions of transactions via ATMs, kiosks, and other self-service devices, as well as via online and mobile digital channels. 
In 2017, the Company introduced DN Vynamic™ Software, the first end-to-end Connected Commerce software portfolio in the banking marketplace designed to simplify and enhance the consumer experience. In addition, DN Vynamic suite's open application program interface (API) architecture is built to simplify operations by eliminating the traditional focus on internal silos and enabling tomorrow's inter-connected partnerships between financial institutions and payment providers. In addition, with a shared analytic and transaction engine, the DN Vynamic platform can generate new insights to enhance operations across any channel - putting consumer preferences, not the technology, at the heart of the experience. 
An important enabler of the Company’s software offerings is the professional service employees who provide systems integration, customization, project management and consulting. The Company's advisory services team collaborates with customers to refine the end-user experience, improve business processes, refine existing staffing models and deploy technology to automate both branches and stores.
Retail
The Company’s comprehensive portfolio of retail solutions, software and services improves the checkout process for retailers while enhancing shopping experiences for consumers.
The DN Vynamic software suite for retailers provides a comprehensive, modular solution capable of enabling Connected Commerce across multiple channels, improving end-to-end store processes and facilitating continuous consumer engagements in support of a digital ecosystem. This includes click & collect, reserve & collect, in-store ordering and return-to-store processes across the retailers' physical and digital sales channels. Operational data from a number of sources, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), point of sale (POS), store systems and customer relationship management systems (CRM), may be integrated across all customer connection points to create seamless and differentiated consumer experiences.
Diebold Nixdorf AllConnect Services for retailers include maintenance and availability services to continuously improve retail self-service fleet availability and performance. These include: total implementation services to support both current and new store concepts; managed mobility services to centralize asset management and ensure effective, tailored mobile capability; monitoring and advanced analytics providing operational insights to support new growth opportunities; and store life-cycle management to proactively monitor store IT endpoints and enable improved management of internal and external suppliers and delivery organizations. 
Service personnel supervise store openings, renewals and transformation projects, with attention to local details and customers’ global IT infrastructure.
The retail systems portfolio includes modular, integrated and mobile POS and self-checkout (SCO) terminals that meet evolving automation and omnichannel requirements of consumers. The Company also provides SCO terminals and ordering kiosks that facilitate an efficient and user-friendly purchasing experience. The BEETLE /iSCAN EASY eXpress, hybrid products, can alternate from attended operation to self-checkout with the press of a button as customer conditions warrant. The K-Two Kiosk automates routine tasks and in-store transactions, offers order-taking abilities at quick service restaurants (QSRs) and fast casual restaurants, displays product information, sells tickets and presents functionality that furthers store automation and digitalization. Supplementing the POS system is a broad range of peripherals, including printers, scales and mobile scanners, as well as the cash management portfolio, which offers a wide range of banknote and coin processing systems.
COMPETITION
The Company competes with global, regional and local competitors to provide technology solutions for financial institutions and retailers. The Company differentiates its offerings by providing a wide range of innovative solutions that leverage innovations in advanced security, biometric authentication, mobile connectivity, contactless transactions, cloud computing and IoT. Based upon independent industry surveys from Retail Banking Research (RBR), the Company is a leading service provider and manufacturer of self-service solutions across the globe. 
Competitors in the self-service banking market include NCR, Nautilus Hyosung, GRG Banking Equipment, Glory Global Solutions, Oki Data and Triton Systems, as well as a number of local manufacturing and service providers such as Fujitsu and Hitachi-Omron

in Asia Pacific (AP); Hantle/GenMega in North America (NA); KEBA in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA); and Perto in Latin America (LA). In Brazil, the Company provides election systems, lottery terminals and product support to the Brazil government. Competition in this market segment is based upon technology pre-qualification demonstrations.
In a number of markets, the Company sells to, but also competes with, independent ATM deployers such as Cardtronics, Payment Alliance International and Euronet.
In the retail market, the Company is a leader in helping the majority of retailers headquartered in Europe transform their stores to a consumer-centric approach by providing electronic POS (ePOS), automated checkout solutions, cash management, software and services. The Company competes with some of the key players highlighted above plus other technology firms such as Toshiba and Fujitsu, and specialized software players such as GK Software, Oracle, Aptos and PCMS. Many retailers also work with proprietary software solutions.
For its services offerings, the Company perceives competition to be fragmented, especially in the product-related services segment. While other manufacturers provide basic levels of product support, the competition also includes local and regional third-party providers. With respect to higher value managed services, the Company competes with large IT service providers such as IBM, Atos, Fiserv and DXC Technology.
In the self-service software market, the Company, in addition to the key hardware players highlighted above, competes with several smaller, niche software companies like KAL, or with the internal software development teams of banks and retailers.
OPERATIONS
The Company’s operating results and the amount and timing of revenue are affected by numerous factors, including production schedules, customer priorities, sales volume and mix. During the past several years, the Company has honed its offerings to become a total solutions provider with a focus on Connected Commerce. As a result of the emphasis on services and software, the nature of the Company's workforce is changing and requires new skill sets in areas such as:

• | Advanced security and compliance measures,


• | Advanced sensors,


• | Modern field services operations,


• | Cloud computing,


• | Analytics, and


• | As-a-service software expertise.

The principal raw materials used by the Company in its manufacturing operations are steel, plastics, electronic parts and components and spare parts, which are purchased from various major suppliers. These materials and components are generally available in ample quantities.
The Company carries working capital mainly related to trade receivables and inventories. Inventories generally are manufactured or purchased as orders are received from customers. The Company’s normal and customary payment terms generally range from 30 to 90 days from date of invoice. The Company generally does not offer extended payment terms. The Company
also provides financing arrangements to customers that are largely classified and accounted for as sales-type leases.
PRODUCT BACKLOG
The Company's product backlog was $1,012.7 and $1,026.7 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The backlog generally includes orders estimated or projected to be shipped or installed within 18 months. Although the Company believes the orders included in the backlog are firm, some orders may be canceled by customers without penalty, and the Company may elect to permit cancellation of orders without penalty where management believes it is in the Company's best interests to do so. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant cancellations within its product backlog. Additionally, over 50 percent of the Company's revenues are derived from its service business, for which backlog information is not measured. Therefore, the Company does not believe that its product backlog, as of any particular date, is necessarily indicative of revenues for any future period.
PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES
The Company owns patents, trademarks and licenses relating to certain products across the globe. While the Company regards these as items of importance, it does not deem its business as a whole, or any industry segment, to be materially dependent upon any one item or group of items. The Company intends to protect and defend its intellectual property, including pursuit of infringing third parties for damages and other appropriate remedies.
