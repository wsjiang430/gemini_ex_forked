Item 1. Business
COMPANY OVERVIEW
 
TraQiQ, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was incorporated in the State of California on September 9, 2009 as Thunderclap Entertainment, Inc. On July 14, 2017, Thunderclap Entertainment, Inc. changed its name to TraQiQ, Inc. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our operations were concentrated in India, Southeast Asia and Latin America, and involved servicing business supply chains with last mile delivery and mobile commerce. We helped businesses in emerging markets leverage the gig economy with the following two-prong approach: (i) we offered our software as a service so our customers could build their own delivery networks and (ii) we offered our network of over 14,000 task workers in India through our Mimo network. In December 2022, we sold a substantial portion of this legacy business. We remain in the technology services and solutions business through our subsidiary, TraQIQ Solutions Inc., and continue to operate our OmniM2M.com website that drives internet of things e-commerce revenue.


On January 5, 2023, we consummated the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of December 30, 2022 (the “Purchase Agreement”) among Renovare Environmental, Inc. (“REI”) and BioHiTech America, LLC (“BHT” and, together with REI, the “Renovare Sellers”) and us, pursuant to which the Renovare Sellers sold and assigned to us, and we purchased and assumed from the Renovare Sellers, (a) certain assets related to the business of (i) aerobic digestion technology solutions for the disposal of food waste at the point of generation and (ii) data analytics with respect to food waste (collectively, the “Digester Business”) and (b) certain specified liabilities of the Renovare Sellers. We intend for the Digester Business to be one of our principal businesses going forward, and we intend to supplement our current business through the acquisition of complementary businesses.


Going forward, our mission is to reduce the environmental impact of the waste management industry through the development and deployment of cost-effective technology solutions. Our suite of technologies includes on-site biological processing equipment for food waste and proprietary real-time data analytics tools to reduce food waste generation. These proprietary solutions may enable certain businesses and municipalities of all sizes to lower disposal costs while having a positive impact on the environment. When used individually or in combination, we believe that our solutions can reduce the carbon footprint associated with waste transportation, repurpose non-recyclable plastics, and significantly reduce landfill usage. As we continue to expand our waste management business we plan to discontinue or spin off the remaining portions of the legacy business.

REVOLUTION SERIES™ DIGESTERS
 
The Company currently markets an aerobic digestion technology solution for the disposal of food waste at the point of generation. Its line of Revolution Series Digesters has been described as self-contained, robotic digestive systems that we believe are as easy to install as a standard dishwasher with no special electrical or plumbing requirements. Units range in size depending upon capacity, with the smallest unit approximately the size of a residential washing machine. The digesters utilize a biological process to convert food waste into a liquid that we believe is safe to discharge down an ordinary drain. This process can result in a substantial reduction in costs for customers including cruise lines, restaurants, retail stores, hospitals, hotel/hospitality companies and governmental units by eliminating the transportation and logistics costs associated with food waste disposal. The Company also expects the process reduce the greenhouse gases associated with food-waste transportation and decomposition in landfills that have been linked to climate change. The Company offers its Revolution Series Digesters in several sizes targeting small- to mid-sized food waste generation sites that are often more economical than traditional disposal methods. The Revolution Series Digesters are manufactured and assembled in the United States.

In an effort to expand the capabilities of its digesters, the Company developed a sophisticated Internet of Things (“IoT”) technology platform to provide its customers with transparency into their internal and supply chain waste generation and operational practices. This patented process collects weight related data from the digesters to deliver real-time data that provides valuable information that when analyzed, can improve efficiency, and validate corporate sustainability efforts. The Company provides its IoT platform through a SaaS (“Software as a Service”) model that is either bundled in its rental agreements or sold through a separate annual software license. The Company continues to add new capacity sizes to its line of Revolution Series Digesters to meet customer needs.
 
Digester Technologies, Markets, Customers and Competition
 
The Company plans to leverage its existing technology, including our digester’s on-board patented weighing system, by collecting, accumulating, and providing empirical data that can aid in improving the efficiency of the upstream supply chain. By streaming data from the digesters, collecting information from system users and integrating business application data, TraQiQ’s internet-enabled system known as the BioHiTech CloudTM can provide necessary data to aid customers in reshaping their purchasing decisions and positively affecting employee behavior. In its simplest form, the BioHiTech Cloud can quantify food waste in a fashion that we do not believe has historically been available. It enables users to understand food waste generation habits and to improve operational efficiencies.
 
The BioHiTech Cloud data can be used to help educate customers as to where, when and how waste is being created. Tracking and analyzing waste based on creation time, food type, preparation stage, origin of waste or other key metrics may provide a clearer picture of the food waste lifecycle. Our digesters provide significant economic savings and decreases in carbon footprint, and we believe that the addition of the BioHiTech Cloud increases that impact by helping customers to manage inventory more accurately and to improve their preparation practices and staff efficiencies.
 
The Company believes that its combined offering of technology and digesters provides customers with information that has not been readily available to consumers in the past and that has the potential for improved management and reduction of waste at the point of generation on a real-time basis.
 
The Company believes that its digester products can remove organic waste from the overcrowded and costly landfills of the world and provide significant benefits to both business organizations and the community including:
 

● | Eliminating the transportation of organic waste, 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Reducing carbon and methane emissions associated with landfilling and truck transportation, 
● | Complying with municipal laws banning organic waste from landfills, 
● | Contributing to corporate and regulatory targets for diverting waste from landfills, 
● | Extending the lifespan of the country’s disposal facilities, 
● | Reducing groundwater and soil contamination at landfills, 
● | Reducing harmful greenhouse gases that contribute to global climate change, and 
● | Recycling food waste into renewable resources (clean water, biogas, bio-solids).

In addition to the removal of waste, the Company’s solution also provides real time information and metrics to improve the efficiency of an organization. Such information has not been readily available to consumers in the past. By providing a cloud-based dashboard and mobile application, the BioHiTech Cloud gives real-time visibility to the status of the device itself and provides insight to the efficiencies of the operations of food preparation and consumption of the user. Using cloud technologies, the Company’s systems allow for visibility into the food preparation and consumption processes on an individual, regional, or national level.
 
The BioHiTech Cirrus™ application allows customers more immediate access to analytical data provided by the Eco-Safe Digester and more efficient monitoring across a number of network-connected devices. The mobile application is available to existing BioHiTech Cloud customers and is available through the iTunes Store and Google Play.
 
Target Markets
 
The Company’s target market for its digesters includes any producers of consistent volumes of food waste. As municipalities continue to enact ordinances prohibiting commercial food waste from being disposed of in landfills, the Company intends to focus its efforts on targeting those businesses most affected by such ordinances. Many cities and states have already banned landfill disposal of food waste generated by large, commercial food waste generators, with pending legislation in numerous others. The Company anticipates this trend to continue as sustainability efforts advance.
Customers
 
Customers for the Company’s digesters are consistent producers of food waste. Industries served include, but are not limited, to the maritime sector as well as retail, healthcare, government, hospitality, education and food service (including traditional restaurants and quick service restaurants). Volume of food waste, as well as traditional waste disposal costs, are the primary drivers of return on investment for customers. The Company sells its products to customers throughout the United States and abroad. We estimate that there are approximately 200,000 potential customers that would benefit from the use of our digesters, which include restaurants, cruise ships, healthcare facilities and local municipalities.
Digester Marketing Strategy
 
The Company markets through two channels: “reseller” and “in-house” direct sales. Domestic and international resellers are granted a non-exclusive license to sell and market products and services. All resellers are required to purchase all products and consumables directly from the Company. In some cases, we also provide annual service to customers of our resellers at an additional charge.
 
As regulations continue to be passed regarding the disposal of food waste, we plan to leverage both our internal and external marketing sources to communicate to and inform the target market of the increasing level of need for our products and services.


Competition
 
There are a small number of companies that distribute products utilizing a similar aerobic digestion methodology as our Revolution Digester, but we believe that they lack our technological depth of data collection, analytics and reporting. With the receipt of a United States patent on our Network Connected Weight Tracking System for a Food Waste Disposal Machine in 2018 and a Canadian patent in 2022, there is a barrier to competitors providing similar technology to their customers. Further, we believe that these competitors do not have a competitive product to the Revolution Series of digesters based on price point, size, throughput, power and plumbing requirements and data collection, analytics and reporting.

Most of these competitors originated in Korea and continue to manufacture their products in Asia and India. One company that we are aware of has claimed to be developing competitive data collection and web enablement, but are unaware of the deployment and functionality of their technology offering. Compared to our competitors, we believe that our machine has the smallest footprint and requires the least amount of water to operate, and we believe it is an industry leader in terms of installations and efficiency. Currently we are not aware of any direct competitor with the ability to capture and deliver real time data.
 
Alternative technologies or processes to digesters or similar equipment are:
 
Traditional Composting: Composting has been in existence for many years and has historically been the only option for organics disposal. Composting:
 

● | Relies heavily on truck collection and transportation. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Uses facilities that can in some cases be considered public nuisances. 
● | Is very difficult to provide accurate metrics on waste volumes and generation. 
● | Facilities are difficult to site and are often long distances from waste generation. 
● | Is neither cost effective nor environmentally friendly. 

 
Anaerobic Digestion: Anaerobic digesters are readily used throughout Europe. Anaerobic digestion (“AD”) is the decomposition of organic waste in the absence of oxygen. The beneficial by-product is gas that is used to generate electricity. AD is generally accomplished on a large municipal or commercial scale and traditionally has not been readily available as an “at the source” solution. AD facilities are beginning to be utilized in the United States and are considered to be a viable disposal option for organic waste. While the technology is sound, we believe that AD facilities face various challenges in the United States, although we believe that AD facilities will continue to be developed and will be a part of the total solution for organic waste disposal. Many private equity funds have made investments in companies that own or are permitting AD facilities. The challenges to AD include:
 


● | Capital intensity of sizeable plants. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Difficult to site with proximity to feedstock. 
● | Need steady, homogenous waste source (pre-processing is necessary). 
● | Relies on traditional collection and transportation of waste (significant costs). 
● | Rely on “tip fee” to subsidize operating expenses. 
● | Difficult to provide data to consumers (similar to composting).
