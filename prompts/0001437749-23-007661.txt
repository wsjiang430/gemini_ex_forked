Item 1. Business.
Overview 
 
We are a vertically integrated cultivator and provider of cannabis and cannabis-infused products in the States of Nevada and California. In addition to these operational cannabis licenses, we hold licenses and are developing operations in Florida and Illinois. Our common shares are listed for trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange (“CSE”) under the symbol “PLTH” and quoted on the OTCQX in the United States under the symbol “PLNHF.”
 
Through our subsidiaries in Nevada, we hold six licenses for cultivation (three medical licenses and three adult-use licenses), six licenses for production (three medical licenses and three adult-use licenses), three dispensary licenses (one medical license and two adult-use licenses) and one distribution license.
 
Additionally, in California, through Newtonian Principles, Inc. (“Newtonian”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours located in Santa Ana, California, we hold one dispensary license and one distribution license.
 
On March 2, 2022, we acquired through a plan of arrangement, and then amalgamated with, Next Green Wave Holdings Inc. (“NGW”). NGW was a Canada-based seed to sale cannabis company, which provided products and services to the cannabis industry in the State of California. See “2022 Acquisition of Next Green Wave Holdings Inc.” With the California subsidiaries obtained from our acquisition of NGW, we received two licenses for adult-use cultivation, one cultivation adult-use nursery license, one cultivation medical license, one adult-use and medical distribution license, one adult-use and medical manufacturer Type P license, and a pending application for a cultivation processor license. Shortly after acquiring NGW, we initiated a series of updates and consolidations of NGW licenses, resulting in upgrading the Type P license to a Type 6 manufacturing license, and consolidating the various cultivation licenses into a medium cultivation license.  Pursuant to the consolidation, on February 27, 2023, we further requested to relinquish our nursery and processor licenses, as those are redundant under the medium cultivation license.
 
On July 1, 2022, we acquired a 23-acre parcel of real property, inclusive of a 10,500 square foot building, near Ocala, Florida which is currently authorized to cultivate, process, and dispense medical marijuana. We are in the process of developing our operational plans and continue to select dispensing locations across Florida which we expect to supply from the Ocala cultivation and processing location.
 
On July 22, 2022, we received the previously awarded Conditional Adult Use Dispensing Organization License in the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin region and intend to open a dispensary in Waukegan, a suburb of Chicago, by mid to late 2023.﻿
 
We currently sell over 123 different strains of cannabis (up to 35 of which are grown in-house) and have a customer-loyalty database of over 385,000 customers. We own and manufacture cannabis products under the following brands: HaHa (gummies and beverages), Dreamland (chocolates), TRENDI (vapes and concentrates), Medizin (flower, vapes, concentrates), Leaf and Vine (vapes).
 
The following table presents the inter-corporate relationships between us and our subsidiaries as at the date hereof.

Our registered office is located at Bentall 5, 550 Burrard Street, Suite 2501, Vancouver, BC V6C 285, and our head office is located at 2548 West Desert Inn Road, Suite 100, Las Vegas, Nevada 89109.
 
History of the Company
 
We were incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations Act (“CBCA”) on April 26, 2002 under the name “High Income Preferred Shares Corporation.” On October 18, 2010, Wombat Investment Trust acquired control of us and on January 1, 2011, we changed our name to “Carpincho Capital Corp.” (“Carpincho”).
 
MM Development Company, Inc. (“MMDC”), now one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, was formed on March 20, 2014 as a Nevada limited liability company under the name MM Development Company, LLC (“MMDC LLC”) with the mission to provide compassionate, dignified and affordable access to cannabis, cannabis concentrates and cannabis-infused products to approved customers in the State of Nevada. MMDC LLC underwent a statutory conversion to a Nevada corporation and became MMDC on March 14, 2018. On June 11, 2018, MMDC completed a reverse-takeover (“RTO” or “Business Combination”) transaction of Carpincho and filed Articles of Amendment to effect (i) a consolidation of its share capital on a 0.875 (new) for one (1) old basis; (ii) a name change from “Carpincho Capital Corp.” to “Planet 13 Holdings Inc.”; and (iii) the creation of a new class of convertible, class A restricted voting shares (the “Restricted Voting Shares”). The Restricted Voting Shares were convertible into common shares of the Company (the “Common Shares”) at the option of the holders on a share-for-share basis.
 
On May 31, 2018, the Nevada State Department of Taxation (“DOT”), the agency which regulated cannabis operations in Nevada, approved the transfer of MMDC’s cultivation production and dispensary licenses to us.
 
On June 26, 2019, we continued out of the jurisdiction of Canada under the CBCA into the jurisdiction of the Province of British Columbia under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (“BCBCA”). On August 12, 2019, our wholly-owned subsidiary 10653918 Canada Inc. (“Finco”) was continued out of the jurisdiction of Canada under the CBCA into the jurisdiction of the Province of British Columbia under the BCBCA and on September 24, 2019, we completed a short-form vertical amalgamation with Finco (the “Short Form Amalgamation”). The Short Form Amalgamation was undertaken to simplify our corporate structure and to obtain certain administrative and financial reporting efficiencies. No securities were issued in connection with the Short Form Amalgamation.
 
Prior to the completion of the Business Combination, the only active business operations of Carpincho was to carry on activities as a venture capital company seeking assets or businesses with good growth potential to merge with or acquire. Following the Business Combination, we have continued the business of MMDC.
 
2018 Financings, Subscription Receipt Offering, Bought Deal Offering
 
2018 Financings
 
Prior to 2018, MMDC was largely financed by its founders Robert Groesbeck and Larry Scheffler, and companies controlled by them, through a combination of cash contributions classified as debt with accrued interest exceeding US$6,600,000 and reinvestment of operating proceeds.
 
On January 1, 2018, Messrs. Groesbeck and Scheffler converted an aggregate of US$3,334,304 of their controlled entity debts to equity in MMDC and Chris Wren, Vice President of Operations of MMDC, contributed valuable intellectual property, including genetic strains, cultivation processes, and manufacturing processes, to MMDC in return for a 6% interest in MMDC. The foregoing resulted in MMDC issuing to such persons, in the aggregate, 25,300 class A common voting shares of MMDC and 49,700,000 class B common non-voting shares of MMDC which were subsequently converted into 25,300,000 Common Shares and 49,700,000 Restricted Voting Shares, respectively, on closing of the Business Combination.
 
On June 20, 2018, Messrs. Groesbeck and Scheffler, through controlled companies, converted an aggregate of approximately US$3,400,000 principal amount and accrued interest of unsecured promissory notes of the Company held by them into an aggregate of 5,532,940 Restricted Voting Shares, or 2,766,470 Restricted Voting Shares each, at a conversion price of C$0.80 per Restricted Voting Share.
 
On October 15, 2015, an original member of MMDC LLC, Ollehea, LLC, requested that MMDC LLC repurchase its interest as allowed under an operating agreement then in effect. Consequently, the remaining members of MMDC LLC at the time agreed to issue promissory notes to Ollehea on behalf of the MMDC LLC in the amount of US$101,997 each to satisfy the repurchase requirement. The notes were repaid by us on July 9, 2018.

April-May 2018 Subscription Receipt Offering
 
Over the course of three tranches on April 26, May 18 and May 23, 2018, Finco completed private placements of subscription receipts (the “Subscription Receipts”) at a price of C$0.80 per Subscription Receipt for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately C$25,100,000 (the “Subscription Receipt Offering”), the brokered portion of which was conducted by a syndicate of agents co-led by Beacon Securities Limited and Canaccord Genuity Corp. and including Haywood Securities Inc. (collectively, the “Agents”). The proceeds from the Subscription Receipt Offering, less certain expenses, were placed into escrow on completion of the Subscription Receipt Offering. In connection with the completion of the Business Combination, the Subscription Receipts were converted on a one-for-one basis into a total of 31,458,300 common shares of Finco and 15,729,150 common share purchase warrants of Finco, which upon completion of the acquisition of Finco by us were exchanged for an equal number of Common Shares and Common Share purchase warrants (the “Common Share Warrants”), respectively, and the escrowed proceeds from the Subscription Receipt Offering, less the commission of the Agents and certain fees and expenses, were released from escrow to us. Each Common Share Warrant may be exercised for one Common Share at an exercise price of C$1.40 for a period of 24 months from the date of issue. In consideration for services rendered, the Agents were paid a cash commission equal to 6% of the gross proceeds of the Subscription Receipt Offering and issued 1,485,645 compensation warrants (the “Compensation Warrants”). Each Compensation Warrant entitled the holder thereof to purchase one Common Share at an exercise price of C$0.80 until June 11, 2020.
 
December 2018 Bought Deal Offering
 
On December 4, 2018, we issued 8,735,250 units (each, a “Unit”) at a price of C$3.00 per Unit and 425,000 Common Share Warrants (the “Over-Allotment Warrants”) for a price of C$0.44 per Over-Allotment Warrant for aggregate gross proceeds of C$26,392,750 pursuant to a bought deal offering (the “2018 Bought Deal Offering”). The 2018 Bought Deal Offering was led by Beacon Securities Limited and included Canaccord Genuity Corp and Cormark Securities Inc. (collectively, the “2018 Bought Deal Underwriters”). Each Unit was comprised of one Common Share and one-half of one Common Share purchase warrant (each whole warrant, a “Unit Warrant” and, together with the Over-Allotment Warrants, the “2018 Bought Deal Warrants”). Each 2018 Bought Deal Warrant entitled the holder to purchase one Common Share at an exercise price of C$3.75 for a period of 36 months following the closing of the 2018 Bought Deal Offering unless earlier accelerated by us pursuant to the terms thereof. On December 23, 2020, we announced that we had elected to accelerate the expiry date of the outstanding 2018 Bought Deal Warrants to January 28, 2021.
 
As consideration for services rendered, the 2018 Bought Deal Underwriters were paid a cash commission equal to 6.0% of the gross proceeds of the 2018 Bought Deal Offering and issued compensation options equal to 6% of the number of Units and Over-Allotment Warrants sold (the “Compensation Options”). Each Compensation Option entitled the holder thereof to purchase one Common Share at an exercise price of C$3.00 for a period of 24 months following the closing of the 2018 Bought Deal Offering. We recorded share issuance costs of C$1,536,302.
 
2020 Acquisitions and Financing, Re-Opening Medizin Dispensary
 
May 2020 Santa Ana Acquisition
 
On May 20, 2020, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock (the “Newtonian Shares”) of Newtonian Principles Inc. (“Newtonian”) (the “Santa Ana Acquisition”), resulting in our acquiring a provisional adult-use cannabis retailer license issued by the State of California Bureau of Cannabis Control (the “California License”) and a regulatory safety permit issued by the City of Santa Ana (the “Santa Ana Permit”), which were both held by Newtonian, and a 30-year lease for a dispensary in Santa Ana, California (the “Santa Ana Premises”) along with certain other assets (collectively, the “Warner Assets”) from Warner Management Group, LLC (“Warner”). Newtonian had no operations at the time of the Santa Ana Acquisition. We issued 3,940,932 Restricted Voting Shares (the “Santa Ana Consideration Shares”), representing an agreed value of US$4,000,000, to certain vendors in consideration for the Newtonian Shares, and paid Warner US$1,000,000 in cash and cancelled an interim buildout loan to Warner in consideration for the Warner Assets. 
 
The Santa Ana Consideration Shares were subject to a four-month and one day hold period under Canadian securities laws and were subject to a lock-up whereby 1/8 of the Santa Ana Consideration Shares were released from lock-up each month beginning on September 22, 2020.
 
On September 25, 2020, Newtonian received a Regulatory Safety Permit Phase 1 approval from the City of Santa Ana for distribution activities at the Santa Ana Premises. On June 18, 2021, Newtonian received both a Commercial Cannabis Adult-Use Retail Sales and a Commercial Cannabis Distribution Regulatory Safety Permit Phase 2 approval from the City of Santa Ana, and on June 21, 2021, received a California Adult-Use and Medicinal Distributor License.

In mid-June 2021, we completed the build-out of approximately 25,600 square feet of retail space on Warner Boulevard in the City of Santa Ana located in Orange County (the “Planet 13 OC Superstore”) and co-located distribution facility, and opened for California State and City of Santa Ana licensed cannabis sales and distribution starting July 1, 2021. 
 
July 2020 WCDN Acquisition
 
On July 17, 2020, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “WCDN Asset Acquisition Agreement”) with West Coast Development Nevada, LLC (“WCDN”), W The Brand, LLC, and R. Scott Coffman, pursuant to which we, through MMDC, acquired cannabis inventory, equipment and tenant improvements located in a 25,000 square feet facility at 4801 West Bell Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada 89118 (the “WCDN Acquisition Facility”), which has the ability to expand to 45,000 square feet (the “WCDN Acquisition”). The purchase price for the asset purchase was US$4.1 million and consisted of US$1,156,000 in cash for the inventory and US$3,000,000 million (US$500,000 cash and US$2,500,000 of Common Shares, resulting in the issuance of 1,374,833 Common Shares (the “WCDN Consideration Shares”) based on a 10-day volume weighted average price of the Common Shares as of the close of trading on July 16, 2020) for the operating assets and licenses. The WCDN Consideration Shares were held in escrow until the Second Closing (as defined herein). The WCDN Acquisition allowed us to solidify our vertical integration in Nevada. The privileged licenses included medical and adult-use cultivation and production licenses in unincorporated Clark County, and these licenses were transferred to our existing Nevada subsidiary, MMDC, to be operated on the same terms and subject to the same oversight provided at MMDC’s current production and cultivation operations in unincorporated Clark County, Nevada.   
 
The transaction was scheduled to close in two parts, the first closing being cash transferred for the equipment and cannabis inventory which occurred on July 17, 2020, and the second closing (the “Second Closing”) being contingent on the approval to transfer the license and receipt of the cultivation and production licenses from the State of Nevada’s Cannabis Compliance Board (the “CCB”). On August 25, 2020, the CCB conditionally approved the transfer of the cultivation and production licenses to MMDC, and on September 3, 2020, MMDC received the cultivation and production licenses pursuant to a letter from the CCB and certificates issued on November 3, 2020. Pursuant to the WCDN Acquisition, MMDC also received a conditional distribution license which it did not place into operation and later sold on January 6, 2023.
 
On September 11, 2020, we mutually agreed with WCDN that the receipt by MMDC of a business license issued by unincorporated Clark County which would permit us to conduct business in Clark County (the “Clark County Business License”) was a necessary condition precedent to the Second Closing. MMDC received the Clark County Business License and subsequently completed the Second Closing on November 27, 2020, at which time WCDN Consideration Shares were released from escrow to WCDN.
 
Concurrent with the first closing of the WCDN Acquisition, RX Land, LLC (“RX Land”), an entity owned by Robert Groesbeck and Larry Scheffler (our co-chief executive officers, collectively the “Co-CEOs” and each a “Co-CEO”), acquired the WCDN Acquisition Facility for US$3.3 million and entered into a lease agreement with WCDN in respect of such facility (the “Initial West Bell Lease”). In accordance with the terms of the WCDN Asset Acquisition Agreement and approvals by our independent directors, WCDN assigned the Initial West Bell Lease to MMDC on November 25, 2020, and MMDC subsequently entered into an amending agreement with RX Land on November 27, 2020, to amend certain terms of such lease agreement including increasing the lease payments, extending the duration of the lease and, if desired, allowing for second floor installation by MMDC without a corresponding lease rate increase due to an increase in facility size.

Each July 2020 Bought Unit consisted of one Common Share and one-half (1/2) of one Common Share purchase warrant (each whole warrant, a “July 2020 Bought Deal Warrant”).

The underwriters received a cash commission equal to 6.0% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the July 2020 Bought Deal Units. The underwriters also received compensation options (each a “July 2020 Bought Deal Compensation Option”) equal to 6.0% of the number of July 2020 Bought Deal Units sold. Each July 2020 Bought Deal Compensation Option entitles the underwriters to purchase one Common Share at a price of C$2.15 until July 3, 2022.
 
September 2020 Bought Deal Offering
 
On September 10, 2020, we completed our previously announced bought deal financing for aggregate gross proceeds of C$23,019,550 (the “September 2020 Bought Deal”) pursuant to which an aggregate of 6,221,500 units (each, a “September 2020 Bought Deal Unit”) of the Company were sold at a price of C$3.70 per September 2020 Bought Deal Unit. Each September 2020 Bought Unit consisted of one Common Share and one-half (1/2) of one Common Share purchase warrant (each whole warrant, a “September 2020 Bought Deal Warrant”).

Each November 2020 Bought Unit consisted of one Common Share and one-half (1/2) of one Common Share purchase warrant (each whole warrant, a “November 2020 Bought Deal Warrant”).

November 2020 Medizin Re-Opening
 
MMDC applied for dispensary licenses in Nevada pursuant to a competitive application process in September 2018, and was notified that no licenses were awarded in December 2018. On information known at that time, MMDC filed a lawsuit against the State of Nevada, along with a significant majority of similarly denied applicants. After the first week of trial in July 2020 concerning that litigation pending from December 2018, MMDC entered into a settlement agreement with the State of Nevada, and defendants in intervention to receive a license in unincorporated Clark County to reopen the Medizin location (the “Medizin Facility”) (the “Nevada License Settlement”). On July 31, 2020, the Nevada Tax Commission convened and approved the signed Nevada License Settlement and requested that the CCB, which had authority over Nevada-licensed cannabis businesses as of July 1, 2020, also convene and approve the settlement. On August 7, 2020, the CCB convened and approved the Nevada License Settlement. Pursuant to the Nevada License Settlement, our subsidiary MMDC agreed to a release and waiver of its claims against the State of Nevada and the defendants in intervention, in return for MMDC receiving the provisional unincorporated Clark County adult-use dispensary license originally received by Nevada Organic Remedies in December 2018. Pursuant to a letter dated September 3, 2020, the CCB transferred the conditional Clark County dispensary license to MMDC. On November 20, 2020, we opened the Medizin Facility, having received CCB final inspection approvals and a Clark County business license.

August 2021 Illinois Dispensing License Lottery Win
 
On August 5, 2021, our subsidiary, Planet 13 Illinois LLC (“Planet 13 Illinois”), which was then owned 49% by us and 51% by Frank Cowan, a resident of Illinois, was a lottery winner for a Social-Equity Justice Involved Conditional Adult Use Dispensing Organization License in the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin region from the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation in the State of Illinois. We intend to launch a dispensary in Waukegan, a suburb of the greater Chicago area, and anticipate that it will be operational in mid to late 2023.
October 2021 Florida License Acquisition
 
On October 1, 2021, our wholly owned subsidiary, Planet 13 Florida Inc. (“Planet 13 Florida”), completed the acquisition of a license from a subsidiary of Harvest Health & Recreation Inc. (the “Seller”) pursuant to which Planet 13 Florida purchased from the Seller a license to operate as a Medical Marijuana Treatment Center issued by the Florida Department of Health for $55,000,000 in cash. No other assets or liabilities were acquired. Licensed Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers (“MMTCs”) are vertically integrated and the only businesses in Florida authorized to cultivate, process, transport and dispense medical marijuana to qualified patients and caregivers. As of December 31, 2022, there were 22 companies with MMTC licenses in Florida. License holders are not subject to restrictions on the number of dispensaries that may be opened or on the number or size of cultivation and processing facilities they may operate.
Recent Developments
 
March 2022 NGW Acquisition
 
On March 2, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), we completed our acquisition of NGW. We entered into an arrangement agreement (the “Arrangement Agreement”) with NGW on December 20, 2021 pursuant to which we agreed to acquire (the “Arrangement”) all of the issued and outstanding common shares of NGW (the “NGW Shares”), and then amalgamate with NGW pursuant to a plan of arrangement (the “Plan of Arrangement”) under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). The Arrangement was approved by the holders of NGW Shares (the “NGW Shareholders”) at a special meeting of NGW Shareholders held on February 25, 2022 and approved by the Supreme Court of British Columbia on March 1, 2022.
 
Pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement, at 12:01 a.m. (Vancouver time) (the “Effective Time”) on the Closing Date, we acquired all of the NGW Shares for a total consideration of approximately C$71,345,747 (based on the closing price of our Common Shares (the “Planet 13 Shares”) on the Canadian Securities Exchange on March 2, 2022), and NGW then amalgamated with us. The NGW Shareholders received 0.1145 of one Planet 13 Share (the “Exchange Ratio”) and a nominal cash payment of C$0.0001 for each NGW Share held immediately prior to the Effective Time. As a result, 21,361,002 Planet 13 Shares and C$18,656 in cash were issued in exchange for the NGW Shares. In addition, the number of Planet 13 Shares issued to any person pursuant to the Arrangement was rounded down to the nearest whole Planet 13 Share, with a cash consideration paid in lieu of the issuance of such fractional Planet 13 Share of C$3.379 per share, resulting in an aggregate cash-in-lieu consideration of C$77.61.
 
Based upon the Exchange Ratio, all NGW options to acquire NGW Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time were also exchanged for our options that will entitle the holders to receive, upon exercise thereof, Planet 13 Shares. As a result, we issued 1,106,925 options in exchange for the NGW options.
 
Though we have since restructured the cannabis licenses of NGW (as more fully set forth in Table 1 in the Licenses section below), through this acquisition, we gained seven cannabis licenses in the State of California. The combined licenses of Newtonian and NGW allow for cultivation, production, distribution, and dispensing activities in California.
 
July 2022 Purchase of Florida Cultivation Site
 
On July 1, 2022, we, through our subsidiary Planet 13 Florida, Inc., closed on a $3,300,000 purchase of a 23-acre parcel of real property, inclusive of a 10,500 square foot building, near Ocala, Florida. The property was previously leased by Planet 13 Florida, Inc., and has received approvals for cultivation, processing, and dispensing via delivery from the Florida Office of Medical Marijuana Use 
August 2022 Planet 13 Illinois Option Purchase Agreement
 
On August 5, 2022, we entered into an option purchase agreement that gave us the option to purchase the remaining 51% of Planet 13 Illinois from Frank Cowan for $866,250 in cash and 1,063,377 common shares of the Company. The option was exercisable at our discretion for a period of two years.

October 2022 Real Property Purchase Agreement
 
On October 14, 2022, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Planet 13 Chicago, LLC, entered into a $2,500,000 real property purchase agreement for a proposed dispensing location in Waukegan, Illinois, for an approximately 8,000 square foot building on 1.9 acres, previously occupied by a financial institution tenant. Our obligation to close on the transaction was conditioned upon obtaining local jurisdiction zoning and land-use approvals, completion of customary due diligence, and that the current non-occupying tenant terminate their lease at the property. On November 1, 2022, the Company provided notice of this site selection to the Illinois cannabis regulator. On February 3, 2023, we closed on this transaction.
2023 Purchase of Remaining 51% of Planet 13 Illinois
 
On February 7, 2023, we exercised and closed our option to purchase the remaining 51% of Planet 13 Illinois from Frank Cowan.

On November 1, 2018, we opened the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore, less than 500 feet from the Trump Tower and less than 2,500 feet from the Wynn hotel. MMDC entered into an arm’s length agreement to lease a 100,000 square foot building to house its Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore dispensary and corporate office space in a Phase I build-out of the location (the “Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore”). In October 2019, we opened a 4,500-square-foot coffee shop and pizzeria in the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore. In 2020, the coffee shop and pizzeria were renamed as the Trece Eatery + Spirits restaurant, owned and operated by us through our subsidiaries. Future plans include the opening of a possible consumption lounge and a non-cannabis retail facility. The Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore lease has a seven-year term with two seven-year renewal options and we have a right-of-first-refusal on any sale of the building. Prior to opening the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore, we sold both medical and adult-use products from our then existing facilities. On April 1, 2019, we entered into a lease and sub-license agreement for an additional 4.17 acres of land directly adjacent to the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore for additional parking. The term of the April 1, 2019 lease and sub-license runs concurrent with the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore lease.
 
We may in the future build a 100,000 square foot greenhouse for cultivation and an approximately 43,000 square foot processing/production facility located in Beatty, Nevada, approximately 120 miles north-west of Las Vegas. The Beatty location is licensed and zoned for up to three million square feet of greenhouse space for the cultivation of cannabis. The site, which is owned by us, has been permitted and is ready for construction to begin. We are evaluating the timing of construction based on a current excess of supply of wholesale cannabis product in the State of Nevada and in the event of future federal legalization. We expect to revisit our expansion plans for the Beatty facility once the wholesale market in Nevada stabilizes.
 
Cultivation
 
We operate our Nevada cultivation licenses at three separate facilities, each location operating jointly under a medical and adult-use cultivation license. Two of our cultivation licenses operate out of Las Vegas in Clark County, Nevada (Las Vegas) and include indoor cultivation and perpetual harvest cycles. One is located in an approximately 16,100 square foot facility, and the other operates out of a 45,000 square foot facility. The third cultivation license is located near the town of Beatty in Nye County, Nevada. The Beatty cultivation facility currently houses approximately 500 square feet of research and development and genetics testing with the potential to expand to over 2,300,000 square feet of greenhouse production capacity on 80 acres of owned land that includes municipal water and abundant electrical power already at the edge of the property.
 
Following the Arrangement which closed on March 2, 2022, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Next Green Wave, LLC (“NGW, LLC”), which is licensed by the State of California to produce, distribute and sell products throughout the State, cultivate and process our cannabis products at our 35,875 square foot facility on one of the four properties utilized by us and zoned for cannabis cultivation in the City of Coalinga, California (“Facility A”). Facility A enables us to cultivate medicinal and adult-use cannabis and distribute cannabis products in accordance with the requirements under the Medicinal and Adult Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act, throughout the State of California.
 
As part of our Florida expansion, on July 1, 2022, we closed on a $3,300,000 purchase of a 23-acre parcel of real property, inclusive of a 10,500 square foot building, near Ocala, Florida. We are in the beginning stages of establishing our cultivation operations at this property as we continue to strategically select dispensary locations across the State of Florida.

Production
 
Our six Nevada production licenses operate at three licensed production facilities, each location operating jointly under a medical and adult-use cultivation license. One production facility is a 18,500 square foot customer facing production facility that opened inside the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore, our cannabis entertainment complex adjacent to the Las Vegas Strip. In operation since October 2019, this facility incorporates butane hash oil (BHO) extraction, distillation equipment and microwave assisted extraction equipment as well as a state-of-the-art bottling and infused beverage line and an edibles line able to produce infused chocolates, infused gummies and other edible products. Prior to opening this facility, we produced our cannabis products at a separate 4,750 square foot facility leased in Las Vegas (Clark County). The second production facility is co-located at the Beatty facility, and the third facility is co-located in the 45,000 square foot cultivation facility located in Las Vegas. Manufactured products and Trendi-branded third-party flower are distributed through Nevada under our Nevada distribution license.
 
Following the Arrangement which closed on March 2, 2022, in California, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NGW, LLC, which is licensed by the State of California to produce, distribute and sell products throughout the State, process and package our cannabis products at our 4,000 square foot facility on one of the four properties utilized by us and zoned for cannabis cultivation in the City of Coalinga, California (“Facility C”). Facility C enables us to process and package medicinal and adult-use cannabis and distribute cannabis products in accordance with the requirements under the Medicinal and Adult Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act, throughout the State of California.
 
Distribution
 
We currently operate Nevada distribution activities, primarily for the transport of our products between our cultivation, production, and dispensing operations, out of our 16,100 square foot cultivation facility located in Las Vegas (Clark County). In addition to self-distribution services, the distribution license is used for the delivery of our wholesale products to licensed Nevada-state cannabis retailers. All distribution licenses held by us in the State of Nevada have been issued to MMDC.
 
We currently operate California distribution activities at our licensed facility in Santa Ana, California to receive cannabis products purchased from our vendors prior to placement in the Planet 13 OC Superstore.
 
Following the Arrangement which closed on March 2, 2022, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NGW, LLC, which is licensed by the State of California to produce, distribute and sell products throughout the State, distribute our cannabis products from Facilities A and C to California-licensed wholesale customers.
 
Dispensing
 
We have three Nevada dispensary licenses, one for medical and two for the sale of adult-use product. Since 2018, the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore, approximately 23,000 square feet of retail space located adjacent to the Las Vegas Strip, has housed one medical and one adult-use license. The Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore has the capacity to serve between 3,000 and 5,000 customers per day through its new, enhanced dispensary. We intend to build out the balance of the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore location with ancillary services such as a potential cannabis lounge in a segregated area of the facility where patrons will be able to consume products that have been purchased at the dispensary. The Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore also houses our corporate offices. Prior to relocating to the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore, the licenses operated out of the Medizin Facility, a 2,300 square foot facility located approximately six miles off the Las Vegas Strip. In September 2020, we received an unincorporated Clark County adult-use license for the Medizin Facility dispensary which had closed when its dispensary licenses were transferred to the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore and re-opened the Medizin Facility on November 30, 2020.
 
The regulatory framework for consumption lounge applications and operations was finalized in July 2022. In December 2022, we were approved for a retail attached cannabis consumption lounge prospective license and continue to develop our buildout and operational plans.
 
We operate one dispensary in California, the Planet 13 OC Superstore, which occupies approximately 25,600 square feet of retail space on Warner Avenue in the City of Santa Ana located in Orange County. On March 3, 2023, we submitted a request to the DCC to add a medical designation to our dispensary license which will allow for the sale of medical cannabis products from the Planet 13 OC Superstore.
 
    12 

  

On August 5, 2021, our subsidiary, Planet 13 Illinois, which was then owned 49% by us and 51% by Frank Cowan, a resident of Illinois, was a lottery winner for a Social-Equity Justice Involved Conditional Adult Use Dispensing Organization License in the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin region from the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation in the State of Illinois. On February 7, 2023, we exercised and closed our option to purchase Mr. Cowan's 51% interest in Planet 13 Illinois. On October 5, 2021, we formed Planet 13 Chicago, LLC as a 100% owned leasing entity to support future operations in Illinois. On February 3, 2023, we closed on the purchase of a dispensary location in the town of Waukegan, a suburb of the greater Chicago area, and anticipate that it will be operational in mid to late 2023.
 
Our Florida MMTC license authorizes us to dispense medical marijuana to qualified patients and caregivers. As of the date of this report, we have entered into four leases for dispensing locations in Florida which remain subject to completion of tenant improvements and regulatory inspection prior to sales to customers.

Uses of Cannabis
 
Cannabis can be vaporized, smoked or ingested to alleviate pain and other ailments. Since 2014, we have been cultivating and selling cannabis in Nevada within the price range from US$6.00 to US$21.00 per gram, depending on the strain. Typically, growth time and strain yield will determine whether a strain is low or high priced. Very particular strains may be priced higher than the given range, but this would be the exception.
 
We offer our customers a diverse range of products, including cannabis flowers, cannabis concentrates and cannabis-infused products. In total, we currently offer over 100 cannabis strains at our dispensaries, up to 20 of which are proprietary strains grown in-house in Nevada and up to 15 strains grown at the recently acquired Next Green Wave cultivation facility in California, covering the entire cannabis spectrum. We believe that carrying a popular variety of strains of medical and adult-use cannabis is essential to long-term success. Each strain of medical cannabis is different. Some of the factors that impact whether a particular strain may be right for a customer include levels of THC and/or CBD and whether the plant strain is a Sativa, Indica or Hybrid genetic variant.
 
We believe that we can gain a competitive advantage by growing high yielding strains which are good extractors and which mature in a short growing cycle while still providing the desired THC profile. Further, finding the right product for a customer’s condition or needs may require sampling a variety of strains, as every person is different. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has not recognized or approved cannabis as safe or effective for any indication.
 
Our cultivation, production, distribution and marketing business is currently focused on the medical and adult-use segments, with product offerings sold through our own licensed retail dispensaries as well as third party dispensaries in both California and Nevada.
 
Principal Products
 
We currently operate the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore, a 24,000 square foot licensed cannabis dispensary located near the Las Vegas Strip, from which we: (i) dispense medical (Medizin) and retail (Planet 13) product lines and provides customer experiences through entertainment features; (ii) provide the consultation, education and convenience services described below; and (iii) own and operate Trece Eatery + Spirits as well as operate a non-cannabis retail merchandise store and event space. Our principal products are cannabis and cannabis-infused items sold to consumers in the medical and retail cannabis markets in the State of Nevada. We sell more than 123 strains of cannabis, up to 35 of which are grown in-house by us.
 
Co-located with the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore complex, we operate a customer-viewable production facility manufacturing wholesale edible and concentrate products, include the TRENDI line, the Leaf & Vine line Dreamland Chocolates, HaHa gummies and sparkling beverages. These products are sold in-store and wholesale to 57 other dispensaries in Nevada.
 
We also operate the Medizin dispensary, reopened in November 2020, and operate the Planet 13 OC Superstore dispensary in Santa Ana, California which opened on July 1, 2021.
 
Through our cultivation and production facilities in Nevada and California, we manufacture and sell brands at wholesale to licensed dispensaries.
 
Competition
 
With respect to retail operations, we compete with other retail license holders across Nevada and California. In addition to physical dispensaries, we also compete with third-party delivery services which provide direct-to-consumer delivery services in Nevada and California. In terms of cultivation and production, we compete with other licensed cultivators and operators in Nevada, California, and other states in which we may operate in the future.
 
Other than the Nevada state cap on licenses and California local jurisdictional caps on licenses, the retail markets in Nevada and California have fewer barriers to entry and more closely reflect free market dynamics typically seen in mature retail and manufacturing industries. The growth of these markets poses a risk of increased competition. However, given that we have entered the Nevada and California cannabis market at an early stage, management views our market share as less at risk than operators without a current operating footprint.
 
Management also believes that there are a number of illegally operating dispensaries and cultivators in Nevada and California which serve as competition to us. We expect, however, that the majority of these illegal dispensaries and cultivators will be forced to cease operations in the near-term. See “Risk Factors.”

Components
 
The main raw materials and components used in the production of our products are cannabis seeds and clones, water, plant nutrients, and electricity.
 
Water for our Clark County, Nye County, and Fresno County operations is obtained from the respective municipal water systems. The price of water is determined by the respective local governments. 
 
Raw materials include soil, nutrients, organic integrated pest and disease management, environmental supplementation, disposable supplies, and other miscellaneous inputs, all of which are readily available from multiple sources at wholesale or lower prices.
 
Cycles
 
There have been potential seasonal fluctuations observed in the first few years of operations at the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore, reflective of the Las Vegas market specifically, as well as industry-wide cannabis-themed holidays and events. These potential seasonal fluctuations have been interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which have presented the industry and the Planet 13 Las Vegas Superstore with a unique set of opportunities and challenges. As at the date hereof, we do not know the long-term impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the previously observed trends. Our Planet 13 OC Superstore location opened July 1, 2021 and has a limited operating history. We are continuing to monitor the seasonal fluctuations at this location.
Intellectual Property
 
We have applied for trademarks at Nevada state and federal level, some of which are currently pending for Medizin, Planet 13, TRENDI, Leaf & Vine, HaHa, and Dreamland. In California, we have registrations for Planet 13 and Planet M. These trademarks were applied for and are designed for use on clothing, wearables, and other non-cannabis products with the intent of creating a valuable brand. We intend to file for additional intellectual property rights in the future.
Environmental
 
We do not anticipate that environmental protection requirements will have a material financial or operational effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position in the current financial year or in future years.
Human Capital
 
As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 567 full-time and 67 part-time employees, and anticipate that number will increase as we expand our operations in California, Florida, Illinois, and Nevada. Full time employees are distributed among several departments, including sales, management and administration, security, cultivation, operations, marketing, facilities, human resources, finance, accounting and legal. In order to ensure that the motivation, integrity and culture of our team stays strong, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) and executive team put significant focus on our human capital resources.
 
We are committed to diversity and to providing equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants. This commitment extends to all of our employment practices including recruiting, hiring, training, promotions, and benefits.
 
Our goal is to use the highest standards in attracting and training the best talent. Our recruiting practices and decisions on whom to hire are among our most important activities. We utilize professional services, industry groups, social media, local job fairs, and educational organizations across the country to find diverse, motivated, and responsible employees. It is a requirement that all of our employees pass background checks and drug screening. To support the advancement of our employees, we offer training and development programs encouraging advancement from within. These programs include employee mentoring and one-on-one quality and regulatory training sessions overseen by our Human Resources Department and Regulatory Compliance team.
 
The main objective of our compensation program is to attract, retain, motivate, and reward superior employees who must operate in a quick-paced and customer-focused environment. To accomplish this, we offer a package of company-sponsored benefits to our employees. Eligibility depends on each employee’s full-time or part-time status, location, and other factors, and benefits include medical and dental plans, paid and unpaid leaves, and flexible time-off. We provide employee wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge, and geographic location. Additionally, we believe in aligned incentives and utilize share unit and stock option plans as well as annual bonuses to align the long-term compensation of eligible directors, employees, officers, and contractors with our shareholders’ interests for a competitive total rewards program.

Legal and Regulatory Matters
 
United States Federal Law Overview
 
At the federal level, cannabis currently remains a Schedule I controlled substance under the U.S. Controlled Substance Act of 1970 (the “CSA”). Under U.S. federal law, a Schedule I drug or substance has a high potential for abuse, no accepted medical use in the United States, and a lack of accepted safety for the use of the drug under medical supervision. As such, the manufacture, importation, possession, use or distribution of cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law. This has created a dichotomy between state and federal law, whereby many states have elected to regulate and remove state-level penalties regarding a substance that is still illegal at the federal level. As of December 31, 2022, and despite the conflict with U.S. federal law, at least 39 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have legalized cannabis for medical use. Twenty-one of those states and the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam have legalized the adult use of cannabis for recreational purposes.
 
While technically illegal, the U.S. federal government’s approach to enforcement of such laws has, at least until recently, trended toward non-enforcement. On August 29, 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) issued a memorandum known as the “Cole Memorandum” to all U.S. Attorneys’ offices (federal prosecutors). The Cole Memorandum generally directed U.S. Attorneys not to prioritize the enforcement of federal marijuana laws against individuals and businesses that rigorously comply with state regulatory provisions in states with strictly-regulated medical or adult-use cannabis programs. The Cole Memorandum, while not legally binding, assisted in managing the tension between state and federal laws concerning state-regulated cannabis businesses.
 
However, on January 4, 2018, the Cole Memorandum was revoked by then Attorney General Jeff Sessions. While this did not create a change in federal law - as the Cole Memorandum was not itself law - the revocation added to the uncertainty of U.S. federal enforcement of the CSA in states where cannabis use is regulated. Sessions also issued a one-page memorandum known as the “Sessions Memorandum”. This confirmed the rescission of the Cole Memorandum and explained that the Cole Memorandum was “unnecessary” due to existing general enforcement guidance as set forth in the U.S. Attorney’s Manual (the “USAM”). The USAM enforcement priorities, like those of the Cole Memorandum, are also based on the federal government’s limited resources, and include “law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General,” the “seriousness” of the alleged crimes, the “deterrent effect of criminal prosecution,” and “the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community.”
 
While the Sessions Memorandum does emphasize that marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance and states the statutory view that it is a “dangerous drug and that marijuana activity is a serious crime,” it does not otherwise guide U.S. Attorneys that the prosecution of marijuana-related offenses is now a DOJ priority. Furthermore, the Sessions Memorandum explicitly describes itself as a guide to prosecutorial discretion. Such discretion is firmly in the hands of U.S. Attorneys in deciding whether to prosecute marijuana-related offenses. U.S. Attorneys could individually continue to exercise their discretion in a manner similar to that displayed under the Cole Memorandum’s guidance. Dozens of U.S. Attorneys across the country have affirmed their commitment to proceeding in this manner, or otherwise affirming that their view of federal enforcement priorities has not changed, although a few have displayed greater ambivalence.
 
On January 21, 2021, Joseph Biden, Jr. was sworn in as President of the United States. President Biden’s Attorney General, Merrick Garland, was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 10, 2021. It is not yet known whether the Department of Justice under President Biden and Attorney General Garland will re-adopt the Cole Memorandum or announce a substantive marijuana enforcement policy. Mr. Garland indicated at a confirmation hearing before the United States Senate that it did not seem to him to be a good use of limited resources to pursue prosecutions in states that have legalized and that are regulating the use of marijuana, either medically or otherwise. On October 6, 2022, President Biden announced "First: I'm pardoning all prior federal offenses of simple marijuana possession ... Second: I'm calling on all governors to pardon simple state marijuana possession offenses ... Third: ... I'm asking [Secretary of Health and Human Services Becerra] and the Attorney General to initiate the process of reviewing how marijuana is scheduled under federal law." Despite these statements which appear positive for the nascent cannabis industry, there is no guarantee that cannabis will be rescheduled federally, that current state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of cannabis will not be repealed or overturned, or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. Unless and until the United States Congress amends the CSA with respect to cannabis (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments there can be no assurance), there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current U.S. federal law. Currently, in the absence of uniform federal guidance, as had been established by the Cole memorandum, enforcement priorities are determined by respective United States Attorneys.
 
    16 

  

In addition to federal illegality and uncertainty of state-driven legalization frameworks for cannabis operators within the U.S., it may potentially be a violation of federal anti-money laundering statutes for financial institutions to take any proceeds from the sale of cannabis or any other Schedule I controlled substance. Canadian banks are likewise hesitant to deal with cannabis companies, due to the uncertain legal and regulatory framework of the industry. Banks and other financial institutions, particularly those that are federally chartered in the U.S., could be prosecuted and possibly convicted of money laundering for providing services to cannabis businesses.
 
Despite these laws, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) issued a memorandum on February 14, 2014 (the “FinCEN Memorandum”) outlining the pathways for financial institutions to bank state-sanctioned cannabis businesses in compliance with federal enforcement priorities. The FinCEN Memorandum echoed the enforcement priorities of the Cole Memorandum. Under these guidelines, financial institutions must submit a Suspicious Activity Report (“SAR”) in connection with all marijuana-related banking activities by any client of such financial institution, in accordance with federal money laundering laws. These marijuana-related SARs are divided into three categories - marijuana limited, marijuana priority, and marijuana terminated - based on the financial institution’s belief that the business in question follows state law, is operating outside of compliance with state law, or where the banking relationship has been terminated, respectively. On the same day as the FinCEN Memorandum was published, the DOJ issued a memorandum (the “2014 DOJ Memorandum”) directing prosecutors to apply the enforcement priorities of the Cole Memorandum in determining whether to charge individuals or institutions with crimes related to financial transactions involving the proceeds of cannabis-related conduct. The 2014 DOJ Memorandum has been rescinded as of January 4, 2018, along with the Cole Memorandum, removing guidance that enforcement of applicable financial crimes against state-compliant actors was not a DOJ priority.
 
However, former Attorney General Sessions’ revocation of the Cole Memorandum and the 2014 DOJ Memorandum has not affected the status of the FinCEN Memorandum, nor has the Department of the Treasury given any indication that it intends to rescind the FinCEN Memorandum itself. Though it was originally intended for the 2014 DOJ Memorandum and the FinCEN Memorandum to work in tandem, the FinCEN Memorandum appears to be a standalone document which explicitly lists the eight enforcement priorities originally cited in the Cole Memorandum. As such, the FinCEN Memorandum remains intact, indicating that the Department of the Treasury and FinCEN intend to continue abiding by its guidance. However, in the United States, it is difficult for cannabis-based businesses to open and maintain a bank account with any bank or other financial institution.
 
In the U.S., the SAFE Banking Act of 2019, H.R. 1595 (“SAFE Banking Act”), was first introduced on March 7, 2019 and passed a vote on September 25, 2019 by the Committee of the Whole Congress, but failed to receive the support needed to pass the U.S. Senate. Generally, the act would let banks offer services to cannabis-related businesses. They could also offer services to those businesses’ employees. In both Canada and the U.S., transactions involving banks and other financial institutions are both difficult and unpredictable under the current legal and regulatory landscape. Legislative changes could help to reduce or eliminate these challenges for companies in the cannabis space and would improve the efficiency of both significant and minor financial transactions. The SAFE Banking Act re-emerged in March 2021, H.R. 1996, with more bipartisan support including with 180 cosponsors. On April 19, 2021, the House passed the re-introduced SAFE Banking Act in a bipartisan vote of 321 - 101, but it again stalled in the Senate. While there is strong support in the public and within Congress for the SAFE Banking Act and similar legislation, there can be no assurance that it will be passed as presently proposed or at all.
 
Although the Cole Memorandum and 2014 DOJ Memorandum have been rescinded, Congress has used the Joyce Amendment, previously known as the Rohrabacher-Farr and the Rohrabacher-Leahy Amendment, as a rider provision in the FY 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Acts and accompanying stopgap spending measures to prevent the federal government from using congressionally appropriated funds to enforce federal marijuana laws against regulated medical cannabis actors operating in compliance with state and local law. President Joe Biden became the first president to propose a budget with the Joyce Amendment included. Most recently, on December 29, 2022, the Joyce Amendment was renewed through the signing of the "Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023" which extended the protections for the medical cannabis industry until September 30, 2023.
 
Despite the legal, regulatory, and political obstacles the cannabis industry currently faces, the industry has continued to grow. It was anticipated that the federal government would eventually repeal the federal prohibition on cannabis and thereby leave the states to decide for themselves whether to permit regulated cannabis cultivation, production and sale, just as states are free today to decide policies governing the distribution of alcohol or tobacco.
 
    17 

  

Given current political trends, however, these developments are considered unlikely to materialize in the near-term. As an industry best practice, despite the recent rescission of the Cole Memorandum, we intend to abide by the following to ensure compliance with the guidance provided by the Cole Memorandum:
 

● | ensure that our operations are compliant with all licensing requirements as established by the applicable state, county, municipality, town, township, borough, and other political/administrative divisions; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | ensure that our cannabis related activities adhere to the scope of the licensing obtained (for example, in states where cannabis is permitted only for adult-use, the products are only sold to individuals who meet the requisite age requirements); 
● | implement policies and procedures to ensure that cannabis products are not distributed to minors; 
● | implement policies and procedures in place to ensure that funds are not distributed to criminal enterprises, gangs or cartels; 
● | implement an inventory tracking system and necessary procedures to ensure that such compliance system is effective in tracking inventory and preventing diversion of cannabis or cannabis products into those states where cannabis is not permitted by state law, or cross any state lines in general;
● | ensure that our state-authorized cannabis business activity is not used as a cover or pretense for trafficking of other illegal drugs, is engaged in any other illegal activity or any activities that are contrary to any applicable anti-money laundering statutes; and 
● | ensure that our products comply with applicable regulations and contain necessary disclaimers about the contents of the products to prevent adverse public health consequences from cannabis use and prevent impaired driving. 

 
In addition, we may (and frequently do) conduct background checks to ensure that the principals and management of our operating subsidiaries are of good character and have not been involved with other illegal drugs, engaged in illegal activity or activities involving violence, or use of firearms in cultivation, manufacturing or distribution of cannabis. We also conduct ongoing reviews of the activities of our cannabis businesses, the premises on which they operate and the policies and procedures that are related to possession of cannabis or cannabis products outside of the licensed premises, including the cases where such possession is permitted by regulation.
 
Nevada State Law Overview 
 
In 2000, Nevada voters passed a medical marijuana initiative allowing physicians to recommend cannabis for an inclusive set of qualifying conditions including chronic pain and created a limited non-commercial medical marijuana patient/caregiver system. Senate Bill 374, which passed the legislature and was signed by the Nevada Governor in 2013, expanded this program and established a for-profit regulated medical marijuana industry.
 
In 2014, Nevada accepted medical marijuana business applications and a few months later the Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health (the “Division”) approved 182 cultivation licenses, 118 licenses for the production of edibles and infused products, 17 independent testing laboratories, and 55 medical marijuana dispensary licenses. The number of dispensary licenses was then increased to 66 by legislative action in 2015. The application process was merit-based, competitive, and is currently closed.
 
Nevada has a medical marijuana program and passed adult-use legalization through the ballot box in November 2016. Under Nevada’s adult-use marijuana law, the state licensed marijuana cultivation facilities, product manufacturing facilities, distributors, retail stores and testing facilities. For the first 18 months after legalization, applications to the DOT for adult- use establishment licenses were only accepted from existing medical marijuana establishments and from existing liquor distributors for the adult-use distribution license. The Division licensed and regulated medical marijuana establishments up until July 1, 2017, when the state’s medical marijuana program merged with adult-use marijuana enforcement under the DOT. After merging medical and adult-use marijuana regulation and enforcement, the single regulatory agency was known as the “Marijuana Enforcement Division of the Department of Taxation”. The DOT oversaw regulation of cannabis operations until the CCB took over on July 1, 2020. As of October 5, 2020, all five members of the CCB were appointed by the Nevada Governor.

In February 2017, the state announced plans to issue “early start” recreational marijuana establishment licenses in the summer of 2017. These licenses expired at the end of the year and, beginning on July 1, 2017, allowed marijuana establishments holding both a retail marijuana store and dispensary license to sell their existing medical marijuana inventory as either medical or adult-use marijuana. All cannabis cultivated and infused products produced under the adult-use program that were not existing inventory at a medical marijuana dispensary were transported to retail marijuana stores utilizing a licensed retail marijuana distributor. Starting on July 1, 2017, medical and adult-use marijuana became subject to a 15% excise tax on the first wholesale sale (calculated on the fair market value) and adult-use cannabis is subject to an additional 10% special retail marijuana sales tax in addition to any general state and local sales and use taxes.
 
The regular retail marijuana program began in early 2018. The Regulation and Taxation of Marijuana Act specifies that, for the first 18 months of the program, only existing medical marijuana establishment certificate holders could apply for a retail marijuana establishment license. As that restriction expired in November 2018, on December 5, 2018, the DOT expanded the application process and awarded an additional 61 licenses for retail marijuana dispensaries in Nevada. The regular program was governed by permanent regulations found in Nevada Administrative Code Sections 453A and 453D through June 30, 2020.
 
In early 2019, Nevada legislature passed Nevada Assembly Bill 533 (“AB533”), which authorized the formation of the CCB to be vested with the authority to license and regulate persons and establishments engaged in cannabis activities within Nevada and promulgated statutes which will replace Nevada Revised Statute (“NRS”) 453A and 453D effective on July 1, 2020. Those statutes are currently codified at NRS 678A, B, C and D. On July 21, 2020, the CCB adopted final Nevada Cannabis Compliance Regulations 1 through 14 (“NCCR”) which are substantially similar to the former Nevada Administrative Code Sections 453A and 453D.
 
In response to industry feedback, on October 20, 2020, the CCB amended NCCR 5 to give clarity regarding public company ownership of Nevada cannabis companies. Generally, those amendments include such companies being required to provide to the CCB notice of annual general meetings of shareholders and a non-objecting beneficial owners (“NOBO”) list as of the record date of each such meeting, and disclosure of any stockholders having 5% or greater ownership interest or that are able to exert control over a Nevada cannabis establishment. Additionally, the CCB requires an updated list of all beneficial owners, regardless of amount or type of ownership, but if a list of all beneficial owners cannot be obtained through reasonable cost and/or effort, the publicly traded company must provide an updated NOBO list as of the annual meeting record date, and explain why it cannot provide a list of all beneficial owners through reasonable cost and effort.
 
Nevada does not have any U.S. residency requirements with respect to license ownership, but does require background checks of all individuals having an ownership interest. Background checks are waivable at the discretion of the CCB for individuals having less than 5% ownership interest. The last background check waiver approval received from CCB was a request we submitted on November 30, 2020 in relation to the acquisition of the conditional Nevada distribution license acquired from WCDN, but which extended to all shareholders holding less than 5% ownership interest. We also submitted a background check waiver request to the CCB on January 3, 2022 in relation to the Arrangement Agreement, which may or may not be acted upon by the CCB (see “Risk Factors”). Although the CCB has not chosen to exercise their authority to require a background check on ownership interests in public cannabis companies that remain under 5% and do not otherwise exercise control over a Nevada cannabis licensee, the CCB does have authority to require a licensee to investigate and submit any ownership interest, beneficial or direct, for CCB approval. For example, under Nevada cannabis laws, any beneficial holder of any of our securities, regardless of the number of shares, may be required to file an application, be investigated, and have his or her suitability as a beneficial holder of the voting securities determined if the CCB has reason to believe that such ownership would otherwise be inconsistent with the declared policies of the State of Nevada.
 
In addition, vertical integration is neither required nor prohibited. All medical cannabis sales are made subject to the recipient holding a registry identification card issued by the State of Nevada as defined at NRS 678C.080. We are permitted to sell medical cannabis products to non-Nevada patients as non-Nevada patients are permitted reciprocity under NRS 678C.470.
 
Nevada Reporting Requirements
 
Nevada has selected Franwell Inc.’s METRC solution (“METRC”) as the state’s track-and-trace system used to track commercial cannabis activity and movement through the supply chain. Individual licensees whether directly or through third-party integration systems are required to push data to the state to meet all reporting requirements. For all licensed facilities, we have designated an in-house computerized seed to sale software that integrates with METRC via an application programming interface, and captures the required data points for cultivation, production and retail as required by Nevada statutes and regulations.

Nevada Licenses and Regulatory Compliance 
 
We are licensed for the cultivation, production, distribution, and retail sale of cannabis and cannabis products. These licenses were formerly issued by the DOT under the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes section 453A through June 30, 2020 and reissued by the CCB under NRS 678A, B and D starting July 1, 2020. All licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at our facilities and retail locations in Nevada.
 
Cannabis consumption lounges were authorized in Nevada pursuant to AB 341 in the 2021 81st Session of the Nevada Legislature. On July 9, 2021, our subsidiary MMDC received a notification letter of eligibility to hold a retail attached cannabis consumption lounge license from the CCB. On June 28, 2022, the CCB adopted regulations for the cannabis consumption lounge application and requirements to operate. In December 2022, we were approved for a retail attached cannabis consumption lounge prospective license and continue to develop our buildout and operational plans.
  Our licenses are in good standing and we, through MMDC, are in compliance with Nevada’s cannabis regulatory program. MMDC has responded to all CCB inspections and received approval on all corrective actions.
 
We comply with applicable Nevada state licensing requirements as follows: (i) MMDC is licensed pursuant to applicable Nevada state law to cultivate, possess and/or distribute THC- bearing cannabis in Nevada; (ii) renewal dates for such licenses are docketed by legal counsel and/or other advisors; (iii) random audits of our business activities are conducted by the applicable Nevada state regulator and by us to ensure compliance with applicable Nevada state law; (iv) each of our employees is provided with an employee handbook that outlines internal standard operating procedures in connection the cultivation, possession and distribution of cannabis to ensure that all cannabis inventory and proceeds from the sale of such cannabis are properly accounted for and tracked, including through the use of scanners to confirm each customer’s legal age and the validity of each customer’s photo identification; (v) each room that cannabis inventory and/or proceeds from the sale of such inventory enter is monitored by video surveillance; (vi) software is used to track cannabis inventory from seed to sale. We are contractually obligated to comply with applicable Nevada state law in connection with the cultivation, possession and/or distribution of cannabis in Nevada.
 
All Nevada cannabis establishments must be licensed by the CCB. If applications contain all required information and after vetting of officers, establishments are issued a cannabis establishment registration certificate. In a local governmental jurisdiction that issues business licenses, the issuance by the CCB of a cannabis establishment license is considered conditional until the local government has issued a business license for operation and the establishment is in compliance with all applicable local governmental ordinances. Final licenses are valid for a period of one year and are subject to annual renewals after required fees are paid and the business remains in good standing. It is important to note that conditional licenses do not permit the operation of any commercial or medical cannabis businesses. Only after a conditional licensee has gone through necessary state and local inspections, if applicable, and has received a final license from the CCB may an entity engage in cannabis business operation. The CCB limits applications for all licenses.
 
We have a full time General Counsel on staff in Nevada, who is a licensed attorney under the State Bar of Nevada, in good standing, whose responsibilities include monitoring the day-to-day activities of regulatory compliance staff, including ensuring that the established standard operating procedures are being adhered to at each stage of the cultivation, processing and distribution cycle, to identify any non-compliance matters and to put in place the necessary modifications to ensure compliance. The regulatory compliance staff conducts regular unannounced audits against our established standard operating procedures and State of Nevada regulations. Each employee is provided with an employee handbook outlining the standard operating procedures and state regulations upon hiring and is then provided with one-on-one quality and regulatory training through programs overseen by the General Counsel.
 
California State Law Overview
 
In 1996, California was the first state to legalize medical marijuana through Proposition 215, the Compassionate Use Act of 1996. This legalized the use, possession and cultivation of medical marijuana by patients with a physician recommendation for treatment of cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine, or any other illness for which marijuana provides relief.
 
In 2003, Senate Bill 420 was signed into law establishing an optional identification card system for medical marijuana patients. In September 2015, the California legislature passed three bills collectively known as the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (“MCRSA”). The MCRSA established a licensing and regulatory framework for medical marijuana businesses in California. The system created multiple license types for dispensaries, infused products manufacturers, cultivation facilities, testing laboratories, transportation companies, and distributors. Edible infused product manufacturers would require either volatile solvent or non-volatile solvent manufacturing licenses depending on their specific extraction methodology. Multiple agencies would oversee different aspects of the program and businesses would require a state license and local approval to operate. However in November 2016, voters in California overwhelmingly passed Proposition 64, the Adult-Use of Marijuana Act (“AUMA”) creating an adult-use marijuana program for adults 21 years of age or older.
 
    20 

  

AUMA included certain conflicting provisions with MCRSA, so in June 2017, the California State Legislature passed Senate Bill No. 94, known as Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (“MAUCRSA”), which amalgamates MCRSA and AUMA to provide a set of regulations to govern a medical and adult-use licensing regime for cannabis businesses in the State of California. At that time the four agencies that regulated marijuana at the state level were the Bureau of Cannabis Control (“BCC”), California Department of Food and Agriculture, California Department of Public Health, and California Department of Tax and Fee Administration. MAUCRSA came into effect on January 1, 2018. One of the central features of MAUCRSA is known as “local control.” In order to legally operate a medical or adult-use marijuana business in California, an operator must have both a local and state license. This requires license holders to operate in cities or counties with marijuana licensing programs. Cities and counties in California are allowed to determine the number of licenses they will issue to marijuana operators, or can choose to outright ban marijuana.
 
State cannabis licenses in California must be renewed annually. Depending on the jurisdiction, our local authorizations must generally be renewed annually as well. Each year, licensees are required to submit a renewal application per State cannabis regulatory guidelines. Provided renewal applications are submitted in a timely manner, we can expect the renewals to be granted in the ordinary course of business.
 
On January 10, 2020, the three commercial cannabis licensing agencies in California, the BCC, the Department of Food and Agriculture, and the Department of Public Health (collectively, “California Licensing Agencies”) announced that California Governor Gavin Newsom’s budget proposal for cannabis industry regulation and taxation included plans to consolidate the three licensing entities that are currently housed at the California Licensing Agencies into a single Department of Cannabis Control by July 2021. With the passage of AB 141 on July 12, 2021, the California Licensing Agencies were consolidated into the Department of Cannabis Control (“DCC”). On September 8, 2021, the DCC announced proposed emergency regulations to move all cannabis regulations into Title 4 of the California Code of Regulations, with a stated goal of consolidating and improving the regulations. Effective November 7, 2022, the DCC made permanent the emergency regulations adopted on September 27, 2021, and March 28, 2022. The DCC adopted a consolidated regulatory package that streamlines and simplifies cannabis regulations, eases burdens for licensees, and enhances consumer and youth protections. DCC proposed changes to the current regulations are available to track online at: https://cannabis.ca.gov/cannabis-laws/rulemaking/.
 
MAUCRSA allows local municipalities and jurisdictions to authorize the on-site consumption of cannabis by state-licensed retailers and/or microbusinesses. If a city or county permits it, retailers and microbusinesses can have on-site consumption if: (i) access to the area where cannabis consumption is allowed is restricted to persons 21 years of age and older, (ii) cannabis consumption is not visible from any public place or non age-restricted area, and (iii) the sale or consumption of alcohol or tobacco is not allowed on the premises.
 
California Reporting Requirements
 
California has selected METRC as the state’s track-and-trace system used to track commercial cannabis activity and movement across the supply chain. Individual licensees whether directly or through third-party integration systems are required to push data to the state to meet all reporting requirements. For all licensed facilities, we have designated an in- house computerized seed to sale software that integrates with METRC via an application programming interface, and captures the required data points for cultivation, manufacturing and retail as required by California statutes and regulations.
California License and Regulatory Compliance
 
As of December 31, 2022, we, through our subsidiary Newtonian, hold the Santa Ana Permit and the California License and are in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of California. In order to qualify for these licenses, we submitted applications and license renewals with detailed plans and procedures evidencing to the applicable regulators that it complies with all statutory and regulatory requirements in California for the operation of the licenses. We have further retained a California regulatory consultant, with experience operating regulatory-compliant California license operations, to advise us on regulatory requirements and updates in that state. Upon closing of the Arrangement, we filed a notice of ownership update with the State of California, and assumed responsibility for the NGW licenses. Additionally, our General Counsel works regularly with our California regulatory consultant and oversees all aspects of services provided in connection with the Santa Ana Permit, the cultivation, manufacturing, and distribution licenses acquired pursuant to the Arrangement completed on March 2, 2022, and the California License to ensure compliance and continuity of those licenses.

Florida State Law Overview
 
In 2014, the Florida Legislature passed the Compassionate Use Act, which was the first legal medical cannabis program in the state’s history. The original Compassionate Use Act only allowed for low-THC cannabis to be dispensed and purchased by patients suffering from cancer and epilepsy. In 2016, the Legislature passed the Right To Try Act which allowed for full potency cannabis to be dispensed to patients suffering from a diagnosed terminal condition. Also in 2016, the Florida Medical Marijuana Legalization Initiative was introduced by citizen referendum and passed on November 8. This language, known as “Amendment 2,” amended the state constitution and mandated an expansion of the state’s medical cannabis program.
 
Amendment 2, and the resulting expansion of qualifying medical conditions, became effective on January 3, 2017. The Florida Department of Health, physicians, dispensing organizations and patients are bound by Article X Section 29 of the Florida Constitution and Florida Statutes Section 381.986. On June 9, 2017, the Florida House of Representatives and Florida Senate passed respective legislation to implement the expanded program by replacing large portions of the existing Compassionate Use Act, which officially became law on June 23, 2017.
 
The Florida Statutes Section 381.986(8) provides a regulatory framework that requires licensed producers, which are statutorily defined as “Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers”, to cultivate, process and dispense medical cannabis in a vertically-integrated marketplace.
 
Licenses are issued by the Office of Medical Marijuana Use (“OMMU”) and must be renewed biennially. License holders can only own one license. Currently, the dispensaries can be in any geographic location within the state, provided that the local jurisdiction’s zoning regulations authorize such a use, the proposed site is zoned for a pharmacy and the site is not within 500 feet of a school.
 
The MMTC license permits us to sell medical cannabis to qualified patients to treat certain medical conditions in Florida, which are delineated in Florida Statutes Section 381.986. As we expect our operations in Florida to be vertically-integrated, we will be able to cultivate, harvest, process and sell/dispense/deliver our own medical cannabis products. Under the terms of our Florida license, we are permitted to sell medical cannabis only to qualified medical patients that are registered with the State. Only qualified physicians who have successfully completed a medical cannabis educational program can register patients on the Florida Office of Medical Marijuana Use Registry.
 
Florida Reporting Requirements
 
Florida law calls for the OMMU to establish, maintain, and control a computer software tracking system that traces cannabis from seed to sale and allows real-time, 24-hour access by the OMMU to such data. The tracking system must allow for integration of other seed-to-sale systems and, at a minimum, include notification of certain events, including when marijuana seeds are planted, when marijuana plants are harvested and destroyed and when cannabis is transported, sold, stolen, diverted, or lost. Each medical marijuana treatment center shall use the seed-to-sale tracking system established by the OMMU or integrate its own seed-to-sale tracking system with the seed-to-sale tracking system established by the OMMU. At this time the OMMU has not implemented a statewide seed-to-sale tracking system. Additionally, the OMMU also maintains a patient and physician registry and the licensee must comply with all requirements and regulations relative to the provision of required data or proof of key events to said system in order to retain its license. Florida requires all MMTCs to abide by representations made in their original application to the State of Florida or any subsequent variances to same. Any changes or expansions of previous representations and disclosures to the OMMU must be approved by the OMMU via a variance process.
Security and Storage Requirements
 
Adequate outdoor lighting is required from dusk to dawn for all MMTC facilities. 24-hour per day video surveillance is required and all MMTCs must maintain at least a rolling 45-day period that is made available to law enforcement and the OMMU upon demand. Alarm systems must be active at all times for all entry points and windows. Interior spaces must also have motion detectors and all cameras must have an unobstructed view of key areas. Panic alarms must also be available for employees to be able to signal authorities when needed.
 
In dispensaries, the MMTC must provide a waiting area with a sufficient seating area. There must also be a minimum of one private consultation/education room for the privacy of the patient(s) and their caregiver (if applicable). The MMTC may only dispense products between 7:00 am and 9:00 pm. All active products must be kept in a secure location within the dispensary and only empty packaging may be kept in the general area of the dispensary which is readily accessible to customers and visitors. No product or delivery devices may be on display in, or visible from, the waiting area.
 
    22 

  

An MMTC must at all times provide secure and logged access for all cannabis materials. This includes approved vaults or locked rooms. There must be at least two employees of the MMTC or an approved security provider on site at all times where cultivation, processing, or storing of cannabis occurs. All employees must wear proper identification badges and visitors must be logged in and wear a visitor badge while on the premises. The MMTC must report any suspected activity of loss, diversion or theft of cannabis materials within 24 hours of becoming aware of such an occurrence.
 
Florida Transportation Requirements
 
When transporting cannabis to dispensaries or to patients, a manifest must be prepared and transportation must be done using an approved vehicle. The cannabis must be stored in a separate, locked area of the vehicle and at all times while in transit there must be two people in a delivery vehicle. During deliveries, one person must remain with the vehicle. The delivery employees must at all times have identification badges. The manifest must include the following information: (i) departure date and time; (ii) name, address and license number of the originating MMTC; (iii) name and address of the receiving entity; (iv) the quantity, form and delivery device of the cannabis; (v) arrival date and time; (vi) the make, model and license plate of the delivery vehicle; and (vii) the name and signatures of the MMTC delivery employees. These manifests must be kept by the MMTC for inspection for up to three years. During the delivery, a copy of the manifest is also provided to the recipient.
 
OMMU Inspections in Florida
 
The OMMU may conduct announced or unannounced inspections of MMTC’s to determine compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The OMMU is to inspect an MMTC upon receiving a complaint or notice that the MMTC has dispensed cannabis containing mold, bacteria, or other contaminants that may cause an adverse effect to humans or the environment. The OMMU is to conduct at least a biennial inspection of each MMTC to evaluate the MMTC’s records, personnel, equipment, security, sanitation practices, and quality assurance practices.
 
Florida License and Regulatory Compliance
 
We, through our subsidiary, Planet 13 Florida, hold the MMTC license and are in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the State of Florida. We have retained Florida regulatory consultants with experience to advise us on regulatory requirement and updates in that state. Our General Counsel works regularly with our Florida regulatory consultant and oversees all aspects of statutory and regulatory compliance for our MMTC license.
Illinois State Law Overview
 
In June 2019, Illinois passed the Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act (“CRTA”), which legalized cannabis for recreational use and created one of the largest adult use markets in the country. The law went into effect on June 25, 2019, and adult use sales of cannabis began in the state on January 1, 2020. Under the CRTA, existing medical cannabis license holders were allowed to apply for Early Approval Adult Use Dispensing Organization (“EAAUDO”) licenses to be able to sell adult use product at existing medical cannabis dispensaries (known as “co-located” or “same site” dispensaries). Existing medical operators also received the privilege of opening a secondary adult use only retail dispensary for every medical cannabis dispensary location already existing in the operator’s portfolio. All EAAUDO license holders were also required to commit to Illinois’s groundbreaking Social Equity program either through a financial contribution, grant agreement, donation, incubation program, or sponsorship program.
 
The CRTA also authorized the issuance of an additional 75 Adult Use Dispensing Organization (“AUDO”) licenses, 40 craft grower licenses as well as infuser and transporter licenses in 2020. Generally speaking, these licenses were to be awarded via a competitive application process. The CRTA provided a significant advantage to applicants that qualified as a “Social Equity Applicant” under the CRTA. In addition, the CRTA authorized issuance up to 110 additional AUDO licenses and 60 craft grower licenses by December 21, 2021. However, due the COVID-19 pandemic, litigation relating to the application process, and the passage of H.B. 1443, which amended the CRTA, the issuance of new cannabis licenses in Illinois was delayed until July 2021. By June 2022, the Illinois Department of Agriculture ("IDOA") has issued approximately 88 craft grower licenses in several tranches, along with infuser and transporter licenses. Note that those applicants who did not win a craft grow license have since sued IDOA alleging a host of issues and arguments relating to the application and scoring process. All such cases were consolidated for administrative purposes and are still pending (In re Cannabis Craft Grow Litigation, Case No.: 22 CH 06071).
 
On September 3, 2021, the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation ("IDFPR") announced that 185 Conditional AUDO licenses have been awarded through three license lotteries that took place on July 29, 2021, August 5, 2021, and August 19, 2021 respectively. These Conditional AUDO licenses were ultimately issued to the respective winners in July 2022. Conditional AUDO license holders are required to site and operationalize their dispensaries within 360 days of license receipt.

Illinois Reporting Requirements
 
The state of Illinois uses BioTrackTHC as its computerized track-and-trace system for seed-to-sale reporting. Individual licensees, whether directly or through third-party integration systems, are required to push data to the state to meet all reporting requirements.
Illinois Licenses and Regulatory Compliance
 
Illinois allows for five types of cannabis businesses within the state: (1) cultivation centers; (2) craft growers; (3) infusers; (4) transporters which are regulated by the IDOA. Fifth are dispensaries, which are regulated by IDFPR.
 
All cultivation, infusing, and transporter establishments must register with IDOA. All dispensaries must register with the IDFPR. If applications contain all required information, establishments are issued a marijuana establishment registration certificate. Registration certificates are valid for a period of one year and are subject to annual renewals after required fees are paid and the business remains in good standing. Pursuant to Illinois law, registration renewal applications must be received 45 days prior to expiration and may be denied if the license has a history of non-compliance and penalties.
 
The cultivation licenses permit a licensee to acquire, possess, cultivate, manufacture and process cannabis into edible products and cannabis-infused products. Cultivators can transfer, have tested, supply or sell cannabis and cannabis products and related supplies to licensed dispensaries, craft growers, and infusers. Infusing licenses permit a licensee to acquire and possess distillate from a licensed cultivator or craft grower and to manufacture edible and cannabis-infused products. Infusers can transfer, have tested, supply or sell cannabis and cannabis products to dispensaries. The transporter license permits a licensee to transport cannabis and cannabis products to and from licensed entities.
 
The retail dispensary license permits us to purchase cannabis and manufactured cannabis products from licensed cultivation facilities, craft growers, and infusing organizations and to sell such products to adult consumers (21 years old or older).
 
On August 5, 2021, we, through our subsidiary, Planet 13 Illinois, in which entity we held a minority interest, won a Conditional Adult Use Dispensing Organization License in the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin region, the most populated region of Illinois. The conditional license was issued to Planet 13 Illinois on July 22, 2022 and expires on July 17, 2023. Such a license will cease to be "conditional" once it is tethered to an approved location.
 
On February 7, 2023, and upon the receipt of regulatory approval from IDFPR, we exercised our option to purchase the majority interest of Planet 13 Illinois. As such, we are now the 100% owner of that license holding entity.
 
We have retained Illinois regulatory counsel, with experience to advise us on regulatory requirements during the pre-license issuance period and following the anticipated annual license issuance to Planet 13 Illinois. Our General Counsel works regularly with our Illinois regulatory counsel and oversees all aspects of statutory and regulatory compliance.
 
Compliance with State Law
 
We are in compliance with California, Nevada, Illinois, and Florida laws and the related licensing framework. We use reasonable commercial efforts to confirm, through the advice of our General Counsel and local consultants, through the monitoring and review of our business practices, and through regular monitoring of changes to U.S. Federal enforcement priorities, that our businesses are in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory frameworks enacted by the states in which we operate. Our General Counsel works with external legal advisors in Nevada, California, Illinois, and Florida to ensure that we and our subsidiaries are in compliance with applicable state laws, including:

● | frequent correspondence and updates with advisors; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | development and maintenance of standard operating procedures with respect to dispensing, cultivation, processing and distribution;
● | ongoing monitoring of compliance with operating procedures and regulations by on-site management; 
● | appropriate employee training for all standard operating procedures; and 
● | subscription to monitoring programs to ensure compliance with the FinCEN Memorandum. 

 
    24 

  

We have not received any noncompliance orders, citations or notices of violation that remain uncorrected or that may have an ongoing impact on our licenses, business activities or operations.
 
In addition, we will continue to ensure we are in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted in the states in which we operate by continuous review of our licenses and affirmation certifications from management. Each new license received by us undergoes both internal and independent reviews, and is subject to all compliance monitoring and requirements that are applied to existing licenses held or controlled by us. While our business activities are compliant with applicable state and local law, such activities remain illegal under United States federal law.
 
Storage and Security
 
To ensure the safety and security of cannabis business premises and to maintain adequate controls against the diversion, theft, and loss of cannabis or cannabis products, we do the following in full compliance with state statutes and regulations:

● | have an enclosed, locked facility, with appropriate entrance security; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | train employees in security measures and controls, emergency response protocol, confidentiality requirements, safe handling of equipment, procedures for handling products, as well as the differences in strains, methods of consumption, methods of cultivation, methods of fertilization and methods for health monitoring;
● | install sophisticated, regulatory-compliant security equipment to deter and prevent unauthorized entrances; 
● | install security alarms to alert local law enforcement of unauthorized breach of security; and 
● | implement security procedures that: 


○ | restrict access of the establishment to only those persons/employees authorized to be there; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
○ | deter and prevent theft; 
○ | provide identification (badge) for those persons/employees authorized to be in the establishment; 
○ | prevent loitering; 
○ | require and explain electronic monitoring; and 
○ | require and explain the use of automatic or electronic notification to alert local law enforcement of an unauthorized breach of security.

Regulatory Risks 
 
The U.S. cannabis industry is highly regulated, highly competitive and evolving rapidly. As such, new risks may emerge, and management may not be able to predict all such risks or be able to predict how such risks may impact on actual results.
 
Participants in the U.S. cannabis industry will incur ongoing costs and obligations related to regulatory compliance. Failure to comply with regulations may result in additional costs for corrective measures, penalties or restrictions of operations. In addition, changes in regulations, more vigorous enforcement thereof or other unanticipated events could require extensive changes to operations, increased compliance costs or give rise to material liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, we may be subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact on our financial statements also could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.
 
    25 

  

The U.S. cannabis industry is subject to extensive controls and regulations, which may significantly affect the financial condition of market participants. The marketability of any product may be affected by numerous factors that are beyond our control and which cannot be predicted, such as changes to government regulations, including those relating to taxes and other government levies which may be imposed. Changes in government levies, including taxes, could reduce our earnings and could make future growth uneconomic. The industry is also subject to numerous legal challenges, which may significantly affect our financial condition and which cannot be reliably predicted.
 
We expect to derive all of our revenues from the U.S. cannabis industry, which industry is illegal under U.S. federal law. As a result of the conflicting views between state legislatures and the federal government regarding cannabis, cannabis businesses in the U.S. are subject to inconsistent legislation and regulation. We began our operations in the State of Nevada, which has legalized the medical and adult-use of cannabis, and have expanded or plan to expand in other states with licensed cannabis opportunities. The U.S. federal government has not enacted similar legislation and the cultivation, sale and use of cannabis remains illegal under federal law pursuant to the CSA. The federal government of the U.S. has specifically reserved the right to enforce federal law in regard to the sale and disbursement of medical or adult-use cannabis even if state law sanctioned such sale and disbursement. It is presently unclear whether the U.S. federal government intends to enforce federal laws relating to cannabis where the conduct at issue is legal under applicable state law. This risk was further heightened by the revocation of the Cole Memorandum in January 2018. See “United States Federal Law Overview.”
 
Further, there can be no assurance that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of cannabis will not be repealed or overturned, or that local government authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. It is also important to note that local and city ordinances may strictly limit and/or restrict the distribution of cannabis in a manner that will make it extremely difficult or impossible to transact business in the cannabis industry. If the U.S. federal government begins to enforce federal laws relating to cannabis in states where the sale and use of cannabis is currently legal, or if existing state laws are repealed or curtailed, then our business would be materially and adversely affected.
 
U.S. federal actions against any individual or entity engaged in the cannabis industry or a substantial repeal of cannabis related legislation could adversely affect us. Our involvement in the medical and adult-use cannabis industry is illegal under the applicable federal laws of the United States and may be illegal under other applicable law. There can be no assurances the federal government of the United States or other jurisdictions will not seek to enforce the applicable laws against us. The consequences of such enforcement would be materially adverse to our business and could result in the forfeiture or seizure of all or substantially all of our assets. See “Risk Factors.”
 
Nature of the Company’s Involvement in the U.S. Cannabis Industry
 
We have a material direct involvement in the cannabis industry in Nevada and California. Currently, we are directly engaged in the cultivation, manufacture and production, possession, use, sale and distribution of cannabis in the medical and adult-use cannabis marketplace in Nevada and California. As of December 31, 2022, we hold an MMTC license in Florida and a Conditional Adult-Use Dispensing Organization license in Illinois which we intend to place into operation.
 
As of December 31, 2022, virtually all of our assets and revenues are directly attributable to the medical and adult-use cannabis market. We hold cultivation, production, dispensary, and distribution licenses for the State of Nevada and cultivation, manufacturing, dispensary, and distribution licenses for the State of California.
 
As previously stated, violations of any federal laws and regulations could result in significant fines, penalties, administrative sanctions, convictions or settlements arising from civil proceedings conducted by either the federal government or private citizens, or criminal charges, including, but not limited to, disgorgement of profits, cessation of business activities or divestiture. This could have a material adverse effect on us, including our reputation and ability to conduct business, the listing of our securities on any stock exchange, our financial position, operating results and profitability. In addition, it is difficult for us to estimate the time or resources that would be needed for the investigation of any such matters or their final resolution because, in part, the time and resources that may be needed are dependent on the nature and extent of any information requested by the applicable authorities involved, and such time or resources could be substantial. The approach to the enforcement of cannabis laws may be subject to change or may not proceed as previously outlined. See “Risk Factors.”
 
Our operations in the U.S. cannabis industry are presently only in the States of Nevada and California and we currently hold licenses in Illinois and Florida. We may, in future periods, expand our operations outside of Nevada and California and intend to restrict such future expansion to: (i) only those states that have enacted laws legalizing cannabis; and (ii) only those states where we can comply with state (and local) laws and regulations and have the licenses, permits or authorizations to properly carry on each element of our business.
 
In addition, we will continue to ensure we are in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted in the states in which we operate by continuous review of our licenses and affirmation certifications from management.

We will continue to monitor, evaluate and re-assess the regulatory framework in the states in which we operate and any state that we may look to expand our operations to in the future, and the federal laws applicable thereto, on an ongoing basis; and will update our continuous disclosure regarding government policy changes or new or amended guidance, laws or regulations regarding cannabis in the U.S as required.
 
Anti-Money Laundering Laws and Regulations
 
We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the U.S. that involve money laundering, financial recordkeeping and proceeds of crime, including the U.S. Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (“Bank Secrecy Act”), as amended by Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (“USA PATRIOT Act”) and the rules and regulations thereunder, and any related or similar rules, regulations or guidelines, issued, administered or enforced by governmental authorities in the U.S. Further, under U.S. federal law, banks or other financial institutions that provide a cannabis business with a checking account, debit or credit card, small business loan, or any other service could be found guilty of money laundering, aiding and abetting, or conspiracy.
 
Our activities, and any proceeds thereof, may be considered proceeds of crime due to the fact that cannabis remains illegal federally in the U.S. This may restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends or effect other distributions. Furthermore, while we have no current intention to declare or pay dividends on our Common Shares in the foreseeable future, we may decide to, or be required to, suspend declaring or paying dividends without advance notice and for an indefinite period of time.
 
Ability to Access Private and Public Capital
 
Prior to the RTO, we relied entirely on access to private capital in order to support our continuing operations and capital expenditure requirements. We expect to rely on both private and public capital markets to finance our growth plans in the U.S. legal cannabis industry. However, there is no assurance we will be successful, in whole or in part, in raising funds, particularly if the U.S. federal authorities change their position toward enforcing the CSA. Further, access to funding from U.S. residents may be limited due their unwillingness to be associated with activities which violate U.S. federal laws.
