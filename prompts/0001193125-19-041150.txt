General 
 Trex Company, Inc. (Company, we, us or our), was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1998. The Company is the worlds largest manufacturer of wood-alternative decking and railing products, which are marketed under the brand name Trex® and manufactured in the United States. In addition, Trex is a leading national provider of custom-engineered railing and staging, systems for the commercial and multi-family market, including sports stadiums and performing arts venues. Our principal executive offices are located at 160 Exeter Drive, Winchester, Virginia 22603, and our telephone number at that address is (540) 542-6300.Products 
 Operations and Products: The Company currently operates in two reportable segments: Trex Residential Products (Trex Residential) and Trex Commercial Products (Trex Commercial). 
 Trex Residential is the worlds largest manufacturer of high-performance composite decking and railing products, which are marketed under the brand name Trex® and manufactured in the United States. We offer a comprehensive set of aesthetically appealing and durable, low-maintenance product offerings in the decking, railing, fencing, steel deck framing, and outdoor lighting categories. A majority of the products are eco-friendly and made in a proprietary process that combines reclaimed wood fibers and recycled polyethylene film. Trex Residential products are sold to distributors and home centers for final resale primarily to the residential market.

 Trex offers the following products through Trex Residential: 
 

Decking | Our principal decking products are Trex Transcend®, Trex Enhance® and Trex Select®. Our decking products are comprised of a blend of 95 percent recycled wood and recycled plastic film and feature a protective polymer shell for enhanced protection against fading, staining, mold and scratching. We also offer Trex Hideaway®, a hidden fastening system for grooved boards. 
Railing | Our railing products are Trex Transcend Railing, Trex Select Railing, and Trex Signature® aluminum railing. Trex Transcend Railing, made from approximately 40 percent recycled content, is available in the colors of Trex Transcend decking and finishes that make it appropriate for use with Trex decking products as well as other decking materials, which we believe enhances the sales prospects of our railing products. Trex Select Railing, made from approximately 40 percent recycled content, is ideal for consumers who desire a simple clean finished look for their deck. Trex Signature aluminum railing, made from a minimum of 50 percent recycled content, is available in three colors and designed for consumers who want a sleek, contemporary look.
Fencing | Our Trex Seclusions® fencing product is offered through two specialty distributors. This product consists of structural posts, bottom rail, pickets, top rail and decorative post caps. 
Steel Deck Framing | Our triple-coated steel deck framing system called Trex Elevations® leverages the strength and dimensional stability of steel to create a flat surface for our decking. Trex Elevations provides consistency and reliability that wood does not and is fire resistant. 
Outdoor Lighting | Our outdoor lighting systems are Trex DeckLighting and Trex LandscapeLighting. Trex DeckLighting is a line of energy-efficient LED dimmable deck lighting, which is designed for use on posts, floors and steps. The line includes a post cap light, deck rail light, riser light and a recessed deck light. The Trex LandscapeLighting line includes an energy-efficient well light, path light, multifunction light and spotlight. 

 Trex Residential products offer a number of significant aesthetic advantages over wood while eliminating many of woods major functional disadvantages, which include warping, splitting and other damage from moisture. In addition to resisting fading and surface staining, Trex Residential products require no sanding, staining or sealing, resist moisture damage, provide a splinter-free surface and do not require chemical treatment against rot or insect infestation. Special characteristics (including resistance to splitting, the ability to bend, and ease and consistency of machining and finishing) facilitate installation, reduce contractor call-backs and afford consumers a wide range of design options. Combined, these aspects yield significant aesthetic advantages and lower maintenance than wood decking and railing and ultimately render Trex Residential products less costly than wood over the life of the deck. Trex decking products do not have the tensile strength of wood and, as a result, are not used as primary structural members in posts, beams or columns used in a decks substructure. However, Trex does offer the Trex Elevations steel deck framing system. 
 We have received product building code listings from the major U.S. building code listing agencies for decking and railing and from the major Canadian building code listing agency for decking. The listings facilitate the acquisition of building permits by deck builders and promote consumer and industry acceptance of our products as an alternative to wood decking.

Customers and Distribution 
 Trex Residential: Wholesale Distributors/Retail Lumber Dealers. We generate most of our sales for our wood-alternative decking and railing products through our wholesale distribution network by selling Trex Residential products to wholesale distributors, who in turn, sell our products to retail lumber outlets. These retail dealers market to both homeowners and contractors, but they emphasize sales to professional contractors, remodelers and homebuilders. Contractor-installed decks generally are larger installations with professional craftsmanship. Our retail dealers generally provide sales personnel trained in Trex Residential products, contractor training, inventory commitment and point-of-sale display support. We believe that attracting wholesale distributors, who are committed to our products and marketing approach and can effectively sell higher value products to contractor-oriented lumber yards and other retail outlets, is important to our future growth. Our distributors are able to provide value-added service in marketing our products because they sell premium wood decking products and other innovative building materials that typically require product training and personal selling efforts. We typically appoint two distributors on a non-exclusive basis to distribute Trex residential products within a specified area. The distributor purchases our products at prices in effect at the time we ship the product to the distributor. Sales to two of our distributors, Boise Cascade Company and U.S. Lumber Group, LLC, each exceeded 10% of gross sales in 2018. 
 Home Depot and Lowes. We sell our products through Home Depot and Lowes stores. Home Depot and Lowes purchase products directly from us for stocking on their shelves. They also purchase product through our wholesale distributors for special orders placed by consumers. Home Depot and Lowes serve both the contractor market and the do-it-yourself market. We believe that brand exposure through Home Depot and Lowes distribution promotes consumer acceptance of our products.

 We are committed to conducting business activities with the highest standards of business ethics and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. Our Vendor and Customer Code of Conduct and Ethics (Code), available at www.trex.com/our-company, applies to all parties providing goods and services to the Company, and all of our channel partners who distribute, sell and/or install our products (collectively, Business Partners). We expect all of our Business Partners, and all of our employees, agents and subcontractors to follow our high ethical standards set forth in the Code while they are conducting business with us or on our behalf. In addition, we expects our Business Partners to understand and comply with the Trex Company Code of Conduct and Ethics, available at www.trex.com/our-company, to do business with Business Partners who share the same commitment to human rights that we have and as set forth in our Human Rights Policy, available at www.trex.com/our-company. 
 Trex Commercial: We sell our modular and architectural railing and staging systems to the commercial and multifamily market, including sports stadiums and performing arts venues, primarily to facility owners and general contractors throughout the country. We market these products through our direct sales staff, independent sales representatives, and bidding on projects. 
Manufacturing Process 
 Trex Residential products manufactured at our Winchester, Virginia and Fernley, Nevada manufacturing facilities are primarily manufactured from reclaimed wood fiber and scrap polyethylene. Our primary manufacturing process for the products involves mixing wood particles with plastic, heating and then extruding, or forcing, the highly viscous and abrasive material through a profile die. We use many proprietary and skill-based advantages in our eco-friendly manufacturing process. Trex Commercial products manufactured at our Minnesota manufacturing facilities are primarily manufactured from aluminum and stainless steel. Our primary manufacturing process for these products involves cutting, machining, welding and finishing. We use Six Sigma and Lean Manufacturing methodologies throughout our Company within our plant operations and in the planning and execution of certain projects. 
 Our manufacturing processes require significant capital investment, expertise and time to develop. We have continuously invested the capital necessary to expand our manufacturing throughput and improve our manufacturing processes. We have also broadened the range of raw materials that we can use to produce a consistent and high-quality finished product. In connection with national building code listings, we maintain a quality control testing program. 
 Suppliers 
 We conduct supply chain assessments when considered necessary in relation to the significance of the purchase and business opportunity for the Company. Assessments include in-person reviews and tours of operating facilities. The Company is committed to conducting business activities with the highest standards of business ethics and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. As stated above, our Vendor and Customer Code of Conduct and Ethics, our Code of Conduct and Ethics, and our Human Rights Policy apply to all suppliers of the Company. 
 The production of most of our decking products requires a supply of reclaimed wood fiber and scrap polyethylene. We fulfill requirements for raw materials under both purchase orders and supply contracts. In the year ended December 31, 2018, we purchased substantially all of our reclaimed wood fiber requirements under purchase orders, which do not involve long-term supply commitments. All of our polyethylene purchases are under short-term supply contracts that generally have a term of approximately one to two years for which pricing is negotiated as needed, or under purchase orders that do not involve long-term supply commitments. 
 

 | Reclaimed Wood Fiber: Cabinet and flooring manufacturers are our preferred suppliers of reclaimed wood fiber because the reclaimed wood fiber produced by these operations contains little contamination and is low in moisture. These facilities generate reclaimed wood fiber as a byproduct of

their manufacturing operations. If the reclaimed wood fiber meets our specifications, our reclaimed wood fiber supply agreements generally require us to purchase at least a specified minimum and at most a specified maximum amount of reclaimed wood fiber each year. Depending on our needs, the amount of reclaimed wood fiber that we actually purchase within the specified range under any supply agreement may vary significantly from year to year.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Scrap Polyethylene: The polyethylene we consume is primarily composed of scrap plastic film and plastic bags. We will continue to seek to meet our future needs for scrap polyethylene from the expansion of our existing supply sources and the development of new sources. We believe our use of multiple sources provides us with a cost advantage and facilitates an environmentally responsible approach to our procurement of polyethylene. Our ability to source and use a wide variety of polyethylene from third party distribution and manufacturing operations is important to our cost strategy. We maintain this ability through the continued expansion of our plastic reprocessing operations in combination with the advancement of our proprietary material preparation and extrusion processes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, we outsource the production of certain products to third-party manufacturers. 
 The production of our commercial products requires a supply of aluminum, stainless steel and glass components. We use multiple sources for each material to ensure consistent availability of material and competitive pricing. We purchase substantially all of our aluminum, stainless steel and glass under purchase orders, which do not involve long-term supply commitments. 
 Training 
 During 2016, we launched Trex University, our state-of-the-art training facility located near our Winchester manufacturing plant. Trex University is designed to educate and train retailers, contractors and other partners on the benefits of Trex aesthetically pleasing, high performance and low maintenance outdoor living products. 
Growth Strategies 
 Our long-term goals are to perpetuate our position as the leading producer of branded superior wood-alternative decking, railing and other outdoor living products, and to extend our position as a leading national provider of custom-engineered railing and staging systems for the commercial and multi-family market, including performing arts venues and sports stadiums. To achieve our long-term goals, we intend to increase our market share and expand into new product categories and geographic markets through the design, creation and marketing of high-performance outdoor living products that offer superior aesthetics and quality, and by expanding our sales to commercial building projects. We will continue to explore opportunities that leverage our manufacturing and extrusion expertise and are tied to our recycling heritage. We intend to employ the following long-term strategies to achieve our goals: 

 | Innovation: Bring to the market new products that address unmet consumer and trade professional needs. Provide a compelling value proposition through ease of installation, low maintenance, long-term durability and superior aesthetics.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Brand: Expand preference and commitment for the Trex brand with both consumers and trade professionals. Deliver on the brands promise of superior quality, functionality, pleasing aesthetics and overall performance in outdoor living products and custom-engineered railing and staging systems.

Competition 
 Our primary competition for our wood-alternative decking and residential railing products consists of wood products, which constitutes a substantial majority of decking and railing sales, as measured by linear feet of lumber. Many of the conventional lumber suppliers with which we compete have established ties to the building and construction industry and have well-accepted products. A majority of the lumber used in wood decks is pressure-treated lumber. Southern yellow pine and fir have a porosity that readily allows the chemicals used in the pressure treating process to be absorbed. The same porosity makes southern yellow pine susceptible to absorbing moisture, which causes the lumber to warp, crack, splinter and expel fasteners. In addition to pine and fir, other segments of wood material for decking include redwood, cedar and tropical hardwoods, such as ipe, teak and mahogany. These products are often significantly more expensive than pressure-treated lumber, but do not eliminate many of the disadvantages of other wood products. 
 In addition to wood, we also compete with other manufacturers of wood-alternative products. Industry studies indicate that we have the leading market share of the wood-alternative segment of the decking and railing market. Our principal competitors include The Azek Building Products, Inc., and Fiberon (a division of Fortune Brands, Inc.). 
 Our ability to compete depends, in part, on a number of factors outside our control, including the ability of our competitors to develop new wood-alternative decking and railing products that are competitive with our products. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the decking and railing market include product quality, price, aesthetics, maintenance cost, and distribution and brand strength. We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors. We believe that our products offer aesthetic and cost advantages over the life of a deck when compared to other types of decking and railing materials. Although a contractor-installed deck built with Trex products using a pressure-treated wood substructure generally costs more than a deck made entirely from pressure-treated wood, Trex products are low maintenance compared to the on-going maintenance required for a pressure-treated deck and are, therefore, less costly over the life of the deck. We believe that our manufacturing process and utilization of relatively low-cost raw material sources provide us with a competitive cost advantage relative to other manufacturers of wood-alternative decking and railing products. The scale of our operations also confers cost efficiencies in manufacturing, sales and marketing. 
 Our primary competition for our products in the commercial and multi-family market consists of companies that provide components to assemble guard rails, including C.R. Laurence Co., Inc., a CRH Group company, regional railing and metal fabricators, and Wenger Corporation. Our ability to compete depends on our product design advantages, relationships with architects and general contractors, and competitive manufacturing costs. 
 Seasonality 
 Our operating results for Trex Residential have historically varied from quarter to quarter. Seasonal, erratic or prolonged adverse weather conditions in certain geographic regions reduce the level of home improvement

  and construction activity and can shift demand for its products to a later period. As part of its normal business practice and consistent with industry practice, Trex Residential Products has historically offered incentive programs to its distributors and dealers to build inventory levels before the start of the prime deck-building season in order to ensure adequate availability of its product to meet anticipated seasonal consumer demand. The seasonal effects are often offset by the positive effect of the incentive programs. The operating results for Trex Commercial have not historically varied from quarter to quarter as a result of seasonality. However, they are driven by the timing of individual projects, which may vary each quarterly period. 
 Government Regulation 
 We are subject to federal, state and local environmental regulation. The emissions of particulates and other substances from our manufacturing facilities must meet federal and state air quality standards implemented through air permits issued to us by the Department of Environmental Quality of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the Division of Environmental Protection of Nevadas Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. Our facilities are regulated by federal and state laws governing the disposal of solid waste and by state and local permits and requirements with respect to wastewater and storm water discharge. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. 
 Our operations also are subject to work place safety regulation by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the States of Nevada, and Minnesota. Our compliance efforts include safety awareness and training programs for our production and maintenance employees. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights relating to our products, production processes and other operations. We rely upon a combination of trade secret, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, and patent, copyright and trademark laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We have made substantial investments in manufacturing process improvements that have enabled us to increase manufacturing line production rates, facilitate our development of new products, and produce improvements in our existing products dimensional consistency, surface texture and color uniformity. 
 Intellectual property rights may be challenged by third parties and may not exclude competitors from using the same or similar technologies, brands or works. We seek to secure effective rights for our intellectual property, but cannot provide assurance that third parties will not successfully challenge, or avoid infringing, our intellectual property rights. 
 We consider our trademarks to be of material importance to our business plans. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has granted us federal registrations for many of our trademarks. Federal registration of trademarks is effective for as long as we continue to use the trademarks and renew their registrations. We do not generally register any of our copyrights with the U.S. Copyright Office, but rely on the protection afforded to such copyrights by the U.S. Copyright Act. This law provides protection to authors of original works, whether published or unpublished, and whether registered or unregistered. 
 We hold a number of U.S. Patents and U.S. Patent Applications for various technologies. We have two current U.S. Patent Applications for decking technology and five U.S. Patents, as well as one pending U.S. Patent Application, for various staging systems, accessories and related technologies. We intend to maintain our existing patents in effect until they expire as well as to seek additional patents as we consider appropriate. 
 We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. If it is necessary to disclose proprietary information to third parties for business reasons, we require that such third parties sign a confidentiality agreement prior to any disclosure.

 Employees and Corporate Governance 
 At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1,214 full-time employees, approximately 837 of whom were employed in our manufacturing operations. Our employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relationships with our employees are favorable. The Company has internal standards related to hiring practices that encourage diversity, formal programs to provide skill development for our employees, and anti-discrimination standards. The Company has not had any serious complaints or claims over the last three years. We have adopted a Human Rights Policy across all of our operations that sets forth our values related to working conditions and human rights and underscores our philosophy about the way we conduct our business. The policy is available at www.trex.com/our-company.
Information related to the Companys governance and related activities and programs may be found in the Companys Proxy Statement filed on March 22, 2018 in Schedule 14A. Also, a copy of the Companys Code of Conduct and Ethics (Code) is maintained on the Companys web site at www.trex.com/our-company. The Company has a whistle-blowing policy included in its Code that encourages reporting by employees of activities the employee considers illegal or dishonest. Each employee is notified of the whistle-blowing policy and a toll-free hotline is provided for reporting issues directly to the Board of Directors and the Companys General Counsel. 
 Environmental and Occupational Safety 
 Environmental 
 The Companys commitment to managing environmental impact includes developing and offering more sustainable products to the market as well as reducing the environmental impact of its corporate activities. From continuous improvement in its manufacturing practices that reduce the use of energy to making products using industry leading high levels of recycled materials, the Company is able to improve its use of resources, its greenhouse gas emissions, and its waste streams. Our Environmental Policy, located on our web site at www.trex.com/our-company, outlines our foundational commitment to conducting business in an ethical and socially responsible manner that respects the environment. Environmental matters relevant to the Companys operations are the responsibility of members of the executive management team, including the President and Chief Executive Officer, the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and the General Counsel. 
 Trexs eco-friendly composite decking products consist of a blend of 95 percent reclaimed wood and recycled plastic film. Trex uses locally sourced reclaimed wood that would otherwise end up in a landfill. An average 500-square foot composite Trex deck contains 140,000 recycled plastic bags, which makes Trex one of the largest plastic bag and polyethylene film recyclers in North America. In addition, Trexs proprietary, eco-friendly processing method minimizes greenhouse gas emissions and our bi-coastal factories reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Almost 100 percent of our factory runoff and refuse are recycled back into the manufacturing line. Any product that does not meet quality specifications is reprocessed, which eliminates the need for landfill. In addition, it is Trexs goal to provide eco-friendly products for the architectural railing market and promote an effort for design innovation that decreases the environmental footprint. 
 The Companys primary resource usage consists of water, natural gas and electricity. The Company develops budgets and plans that improve shareholder return by ensuring the optimal use of each resource, which promotes resource efficiency and minimal waste of the resource. Water management is of critical importance to us and we prioritize energy savings as part of our ongoing evaluation and optimization of business operations and manufacturing processes. We ensure that all of our manufacturing facilities meet emission standards for the locality in which they operate, and certify to applicable authorities that our emissions are within the relevant localitys standards.

 Market Recognition of Trex Brands Environmental Characteristics 
 The Companys internal standards for environmental stewardship and product integrity are recognized year-over-year in the marketplace. In 2016, Trex was honored as Environmental Vendor of the Year by The Home Depot. In 2018 for the eleventh year in a row, Trex secured the highest number of top spots in the Builder magazine Brand Use Study across numerous award categories. For the past 8 years, Trex has been an award recipient in the Green Builder trade magazine Readers Choice for greenest decking brand. 
 Trex Residential decking products meet LEED requirements for builders and our commercial products have contributed to the LEED certifications of some high profile venues. LEED is a point-based system created in part by the U.S. Green Building Council and designed to reward points to building projects that incorporate efficient, and safe eco-friendly products, leading to a buildings designation as LEED Silver, Gold or Platinum. LEED buildings attract higher demand, premium rates and longer occupancy leases, thereby supporting continued and growing demand for products that can facilitate LEED designations. As a U.S. Green Building Council member, Trex works along with council members to transform the way buildings and communities are designed, built and operated with the goal of creating environmentally and socially responsible spaces that improve the quality of life. 
 Trex Commercial railing products also typically contribute to LEED certification points in the Materials and Resources category based on recycled aluminum, steel, stainless steel and glass content.
