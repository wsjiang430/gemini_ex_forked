Verdant | Verdant Holding Company, Ltd. 

We have included a Glossary of Selected Reinsurance Terms at the end of “Part 1, Item 1. Business” of this Form 10-K.
Company Overview

Greenlight Capital Re is a holding company that was incorporated in July 2004 under the laws of the Cayman Islands. In August 2004, we raised gross proceeds of $212.2 million from private placements of Greenlight Capital Re’s Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares, or, collectively, the ordinary shares. On May 24, 2007, Greenlight Capital Re raised proceeds of $208.3 million, net of underwriting fees, in an initial public offering of Class A ordinary shares, as well as an additional $50.0 million from a private placement of Class B ordinary shares.

We are a Cayman Islands headquartered global property and casualty reinsurer with a reinsurance and investment strategy that we believe differentiates us from most of our competitors. We conduct our reinsurance operations through two licensed and regulated reinsurance entities: Greenlight Re, based in the Cayman Islands, and GRIL, based in Dublin, Ireland. Greenlight Re provides multi-line property and casualty reinsurance globally, while GRIL focuses mainly on the European market and primarily serves clients located in Europe. Our goal is to build long-term shareholder value by providing risk management products and services to the insurance, reinsurance and other risk marketplaces. We focus on delivering risk solutions to clients and brokers who value our expertise, analytics and customer service offerings.

We aim to complement our underwriting results with a non-traditional investment approach in order to achieve higher rates of return over the long term than reinsurance companies that employ more traditional investment strategies. Our investments are managed according to a value-oriented philosophy, which holds long positions in perceived undervalued securities and short positions in perceived overvalued securities. In addition, from time to time, we make long-term strategic investments in insurance companies and general agents to complement our strategy and strengthen our client relationships. To facilitate such strategic investments, we formed Verdant, which, among other activities, has made and may make strategic investments in a select group of property and casualty insurers and general agents in the United States.

Because we endeavor to adapt our portfolio over time in response to market conditions and our risk appetite, period-to-period comparisons of our underwriting results may not be meaningful. In addition, our historical investment results may not necessarily be indicative of future performance. Due to the nature of our reinsurance and investment strategies, our operating results will likely fluctuate from period to period.
Description of Business

Greenlight Re is licensed and regulated by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (“CIMA”) to write property and casualty reinsurance business as well as long term business (e.g., life insurance, long term disability, long term care, etc.); however, to date, we have not written any long term business. GRIL is licensed and regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (“CBI”) to write property and casualty reinsurance business. Currently, we manage our business on the basis of one operating segment: property and casualty reinsurance. Within that segment, we employ a two-pillar strategy: 
1. Underwriting traditional property and casualty reinsurance 
We offer excess of loss and quota share products across a range of classes in the property and casualty market. Our underwriting approach varies by class and type of opportunity:
4


● | where we have domain-specific expertise and a high level of market access, we may seek to act as the lead underwriter to achieve greater influence in negotiating pricing, terms and conditions; 
● | where our expertise is sufficient to thoroughly evaluate the risk, we will generally seek to participate on syndicated placements that have been negotiated and priced by another party that we judge to have market-leading expertise in the class, or as a quota share retrocessionaire of a market-leading reinsurer.

2. Risk innovation and strategic partnerships
We seek to develop a range of risk products, via strategic partnerships and other methods, with the objective of providing fee income, access to a stream of underwriting business, and/or the potential for investment upside.
Our initiatives in this space generally aim to meet at least one of several criteria:

● | the value we add to a partnership primarily comes from application of our risk expertise, not solely capital or reinsurance support; 
● | the partnership adds expertise to our company, in specific risk areas, technology, product innovation, and/or other areas; 
● | the partnership provides access to a pool of capital, to products and/or to distribution; 
● | overall, the partnership creates a combined effort that generates durable strategic and/or competitive position in one or more markets, and increases our opportunity for revenue growth and margin expansion.


Our investment strategy, like our reinsurance strategy, is designed to maximize returns over the long term while minimizing the risk of capital loss. Unlike the investment strategies of many of our traditional competitors, which invest primarily in fixed-income securities either directly or through fixed-fee arrangements with one or more investment managers, our investment strategy is to invest (directly or indirectly) in long and short positions primarily in publicly-traded equity and corporate debt instruments.
Prior to September 1, 2018, substantially all of our investable assets were invested through a joint venture arrangement in which DME Advisors, LLC (“DME”) acted as the investment advisor. We were party to a joint venture agreement (the “venture agreement”) with DME Advisors, LP (“DME Advisors”) and DME under which the Company, its reinsurance subsidiaries and DME were participants in a joint venture (the “Joint Venture”) for the purpose of managing certain jointly held assets. On September 1, 2018, the Company and DME entered into a termination agreement (the “Termination Agreement”) for the Joint Venture.
On September 1, 2018, we entered into an amended and restated exempted limited partnership agreement (the “SILP LPA”) of Solasglas Investments, LP (“SILP”), with DME Advisors II, LLC (“DME II”), as General Partner, Greenlight Re, GRIL and the initial limited partner (each, a “Partner”). The SILP LPA, in conjunction with a participation agreement, replaced the venture agreement and assigned and/or transferred Greenlight Re’s and GRIL’s net invested assets in the Joint Venture to SILP. Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, the Joint Venture terminated on January 2, 2019 and substantially all investments were transferred to SILP. The investment in SILP is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets under the caption “Investment in related party investment fund”.
On February 26, 2019, effective as of September 1, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the SILP LPA. The
amendment was intended to revise the mechanics for calculating the Carryforward Account and Performance Allocation (as
defined in the SILP LPA) to take into account withdrawals from and subsequent recontributions of capital to SILP, consistent
with the treatment under the Joint Venture.
 On September 1, 2018, SILP entered into a SILP investment advisory agreement (the “IAA”) with DME Advisors, with an initial term ending on August 31, 2023 subject to automatic extensions for successive three-year terms. DME Advisors is compensated with a fixed annual fee based on assets under management while DME II is compensated on the positive performance of the portfolio, subject to a loss carry forward. DME Advisors is a value-oriented investment advisor that analyzes companies’ available financial data, business strategies and prospects in an effort to identify undervalued and overvalued securities. DME Advisors and DME II are controlled by David Einhorn, the Chairman of our Board of Directors and the President of Greenlight Capital, Inc. DME Advisors has the contractual right to manage substantially all of our investable assets, and is required to follow our investment guidelines and to act in a manner that is fair and equitable in allocating investment opportunities to SILP. However, DME Advisors is not otherwise restricted with respect to the nature or timing of making investments for SILP .

We measure our success by long-term growth in book value per share, which we believe is the most comprehensive gauge of the performance of our business. Accordingly, our incentive compensation plans are designed to align employee and shareholder interests. Compensation under our cash bonus plan is largely dependent on the ultimate underwriting returns of our business measured over a multi-year period, rather than premium targets or estimated underwriting profitability for the year in which we initially underwrite the business.

We seek to grow and diversify our portfolio. Our allocation of risk will vary based on our perception of the opportunities available in each line of business at each point in time. As our focus on certain lines fluctuates based upon market conditions, we may only offer or underwrite a limited number of lines in any given period. We seek to:  


● | target markets and lines of business where we believe an appropriate risk/reward profile exists; 
● | attract and retain clients with expertise in their respective lines of business; 
● | employ strict underwriting discipline; and 
● | select reinsurance opportunities with anticipated favorable returns on capital over the life of the contract.

Additional information about our business is set forth in “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included herein.
Marketing and Distribution

Business transacted using intermediaries
A majority of our business is sourced through reinsurance brokers. Brokerage distribution channels provide us with access to an efficient, variable cost and global distribution system without the significant time and expense that would be incurred in creating a wholly-owned distribution network. In addition to distribution, many intermediaries also provide valuable services including risk analytics, processing and clearing. 

We aim to build and strengthen long-term relationships with global reinsurance brokers. Our management team has significant relationships with most of the primary and specialty broker intermediaries in the reinsurance marketplace. We believe that by maintaining close relationships with brokers we will be able to continue to obtain access to a broad range of reinsurance clients and opportunities. 

We seek to strengthen our broker relationships and become the preferred choice of brokers and clients by providing, where applicable:

● | customized solutions that address the specific business needs of our clients; 
● | demonstrated expertise in the underlying reinsured exposures and in the operation of the contracts;
● | rapid response to risk submissions; 
● | timely payment of claims; 
● | financial security; and 
● | clear indication of risks we will and will not underwrite. 

We focus on the quality and financial strength of any brokerage firm with which we do business. Brokers do not have the authority to bind us to any reinsurance contract. Reinsurance brokers receive a brokerage commission that is usually a percentage of gross premiums written. 
The following table sets forth the premiums sourced from brokers who each accounted for more than 10% of our gross written premiums:  

 | Year ended December 31
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
 | ($ in thousands) 
Guy Carpenter | $ | 376,696 | | | 66.4 | % | | $ | 366,390 | | 52.9 | % | $ | 274,816 | 51.3 | %

We meet frequently in the Cayman Islands, Ireland and elsewhere with brokers and senior representatives of clients and prospective clients. All contract submissions are received, reviewed and approved in our offices in the Cayman Islands or Ireland. Due to our dependence on brokers, the inability to obtain business from them could adversely affect our business strategy. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — The inability to obtain business provided from brokers could adversely affect our business strategy and results of operations.” In addition, we may assume a degree of the credit risk of our reinsurance brokers. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — We are subject to the credit risk of our brokers, cedents and agents.”
Underwriting and Risk Management

We have established an underwriting platform composed of experienced underwriters and actuaries. We have underwriting operations in two locations, Cayman Islands and Dublin, Ireland that respectively provide proximity to key markets in the U.S. and Europe. Our experienced team allows us to deploy our capital in a variety of lines of business and to capitalize on opportunities that we believe offer favorable returns on equity over the long term. Our underwriters and actuaries have expertise in multiple lines of business, and we also look to outside consultants on a fee-for-service basis to help us with niche areas of expertise when we deem it appropriate. We generally apply the following underwriting and risk management principles:
Economics of Results

Our primary underwriting goal is to build a reinsurance portfolio that maximizes economic results within certain risk and volatility constraints. In pricing our products, we assume investment returns that approximate the risk-free rate, which we review and adjust, if necessary, on an annual basis.
Analysis Approach
Our analysis approach to underwriting begins at the class-of-business level. We endeavor to understand the risks and dynamics of each market in which we underwrite business. This analysis includes identification and assessment of structural drivers of risk and emerging trends in loss, as well as attempts to understand the market participants and results, capacity conditions for supply and demand, and other factors. In building our views on individual classes, we organize our underwriting professionals into teams that generally specialize by line of business and are supported by quantitative professionals. Combined with cross-line management and insights, we believe this approach allows the building and deployment of deeper expertise and more thorough insight into the risk dynamics of the line and on external risk factors that will affect each transaction.
Our teams carefully underwrite each individual transaction within the overall line-of-business view. Each transaction is assigned to a deal team composed of underwriting and quantitative professionals to evaluate underwriting, pricing and structuring. Prior to committing capital to any transaction, the deal team must obtain approval from the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Underwriting Officer. This presentation addresses key components of the proposed transaction, including assumptions and threats, market and individual deal risk factors, market capacity dynamics, transaction structure and pricing, maximum downside, and other factors. 
8

We spend a significant amount of time with our current and prospective clients and brokers to understand the risks associated with each potential transaction and structure each contract on the basis of this understanding. Where necessary, we conduct or contract for on-site audits or reviews of the clients’ underwriting files, systems and operations. We usually obtain significant amounts of data from our clients to conduct a thorough actuarial modeling analysis. As part of our pricing and underwriting process, we assess, among other factors:

● | the client’s and industry’s historical loss data; 
● | the expected duration for claims to fully develop; 
● | the client’s pricing and underwriting strategies; 
● | the geographic areas in which the client is doing business and its market share; 
● | the reputation and financial strength of the client and its management and underwriting teams;
● | the reputation and expertise of the broker; 
● | the likelihood of establishing a long-term relationship with the client and the broker; and 
● | reports provided by independent industry specialists. 

We have developed and use proprietary quantitative models, and also use several commercially available tools to price our business. Our models consider conventional underwriting and risk metrics, and incorporate various class specific and/or market specific aspects from our line of business analyses. In using quantitative models, we consider the quality and predictive power of the quantitative work, including explicit assessment of the data quality, and we place greater weight on scenarios that result in greater losses. We price each transaction based on our view of the merits and structure of the transaction.  
Underwriting Authorities

The Underwriting Committee of our Board of Directors, which we refer to as the Underwriting Committee, sets parameters for aggregate property catastrophic caps and limits for maximum loss potential under any individual contract. The Underwriting Committee must approve any exceptions to the established limits. The maximum underwriting authorities, as set by our Underwriting Committee, may be amended from time to time, including as and when our capital base changes. Our underwriting authorities are designed to ensure that the premium we receive is appropriate on a risk-adjusted basis.
Retrocessional Coverage

We purchase retrocessional coverage for one or more of the following reasons: to manage our overall catastrophe events exposure, to reduce our net liability on individual risks, to obtain additional underwriting capacity and/or to balance our underwriting portfolio. 

The amount of retrocessional coverage that we purchase varies based on numerous factors, some of which include the inherent volatility and risk accumulation of the portfolio of business we write and the level of our capital base. Our portfolio, and by extension our gross risk position will change in size from year to year depending on market opportunities, so it is not possible to predict the level of retrocessional coverage that we will purchase in any future year.  

We generally purchase uncollateralized retrocessional coverage only from reinsurers with a minimum financial strength ratings of “A- (Excellent)” from A.M. Best Company, Inc. (“A.M. Best”) or an equivalent rating from a recognized rating service. For lower rated or non-rated reinsurers, we endeavor to obtain and monitor collateral in the form of cash, funds withheld, letters of credit, regulatory trusts or other collateral in the form of guarantees. As of December 31, 2018, the aggregate amount due from reinsurers from retrocessional coverages represents 9.1% (2017: 6.3%) of our gross loss reserves. For further details please see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers to assess their ability to honor their obligations. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, no provision for uncollectible losses recoverable was considered necessary.

Claims Management

Our claims management process begins upon receipt of claims notifications from our clients or third-party administrators. Reserving and settlement authority are reviewed in accordance with the requirements of the individual contract and, as necessary, discussed with the underwriter. Our in-house claims officer is responsible for overseeing the review of claims and providing approval for complex or large claim settlements. Claims in excess of the claims officer’s authority are referred to the general counsel, together with the claims officer’s recommendations, for secondary approval. Claim payments above a certain threshold, must be approved by our Chief Executive Officer. We believe that this process ensures that we pay claims consistently within the terms and conditions of each contract.
Where necessary, we conduct or contract for on-site claims audits at cedents and third-party administrators, particularly for large accounts and for those whose performance differs from our expectations. Through these audits, we evaluate and monitor the third-party administrators’ and ceding companies’ claims-handling practices, including the organization of their claims departments, their fact-finding and investigation techniques, their loss notifications, the adequacy of their reserves, their negotiation and settlement practices and their adherence to claims-handling guidelines.

We recognize that fair interpretation of our reinsurance agreements with our clients and timely payment of covered claims are valuable services to our clients.
Reserves

Our reserving philosophy is to set reserves that represent our best estimate of the ultimate future liabilities arising from the risks we have underwritten. Our actuaries perform quarterly reviews of our portfolio and provide reserving estimates in line with our stated reserving philosophy. In doing so, our actuaries split our portfolio of business into reserving analysis segments based primarily on homogeneity considerations. Currently, this process involves analysis at the individual client or transaction level. 
We engage independent external actuaries who review and provide an opinion on these reserve estimates at least once a year. Due to the use of different assumptions and loss experience, the amount we establish as reserves with respect to individual risks, clients, transactions or classes of business may be greater or less than those established by our clients or ceding companies. Reserves include claims reported but not yet paid, claims incurred but not reported and claims in the process of settlement. Additional underwriting liabilities include unearned premiums, premium deposits and profit commissions earned but not yet paid.

Reserves do not represent an exact quantification of the ultimate future liability that will emerge on our portfolio. Rather, reserves represent our best estimate of the expected cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of the business on our books. Although the methods for establishing reserves are well tested, many of the assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation. We base our estimates on our assessment of facts and circumstances known at the time of the estimate, as well as estimates of future trends in claim severity and frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors, including the actions of third parties, which are beyond our control. See Note 8 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of claims reserves, loss development tables by accident year and for explanations of significant prior period loss development movements. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business — If our losses and loss adjustment expenses greatly exceed our loss reserves, our financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.
10

Collateral Arrangements and Letter of Credit Facilities

We are licensed and admitted as an insurer only in the Cayman Islands and the European Economic Area. Many jurisdictions, such as the United States, do not permit clients to take credit for reinsurance on their statutory financial statements if such reinsurance is obtained from unlicensed or non-admitted insurers, without appropriate collateral. As a result, we anticipate that all of our U.S. clients and a portion of our non-U.S. clients will require us to provide collateral for the contracts we bind with them. This collateral can be provided as funds withheld, trust arrangements or letters of credit. As of December 31, 2018, we had two letter of credit facilities with an aggregate capacity of $414.9 million (2017: $600.0 million). On September 26, 2017, we provided a notice of cancellation to JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A. to terminate a letter of credit facility of $100.0 million. The termination was effective on January 27, 2018. Additionally, effective November 30, 2018, we amended the Butterfield Bank letter of credit facility to reduce the facility limit from $50.0 million to $14.9 million. As of December 31, 2018, we had issued letters of credit totaling $208.3 million (2017: $188.5 million) to clients. Additionally, as of December 31, 2018, we had pledged $463.4 million (2017: $377.9 million) as collateral through trust arrangements. The failure to maintain, replace or increase our letter of credit facilities and trust arrangements on commercially acceptable terms may significantly and negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business — Our failure to maintain sufficient collateral arrangements or to increase our collateral capacity on commercially acceptable terms as we grow could significantly and negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy. ”
Competition

The reinsurance industry is highly competitive. We compete with major reinsurers, most of which are well established, have significant operating histories and strong financial strength ratings, and have developed long-standing client relationships.

Our competitors vary according to the individual market and situation, but generally include Arch, Axis, Everest Re, Hamilton Re, Hannover Re, Partner Re, Renaissance Re and Third Point Re as well as smaller companies, other niche reinsurers and Lloyd’s syndicates and their related entities. Although we seek to provide coverage where capacity and alternatives are limited, we directly compete with these and other larger companies due to the breadth of their coverage across the property and casualty market in substantially all lines of business. See "Item 1A – Risk Factors – Risks Relating to Our Business – Competitors with greater resources may make it difficult for us to effectively market our products or offer our products at a profit.”
Ratings

Currently, our reinsurance subsidiaries, Greenlight Re and GRIL are both rated “A- (Excellent)” by A.M. Best. The “A- (Excellent)” rating from A.M. Best is the fourth highest of 13 ratings. We believe that a strong rating is an important factor in the marketing of reinsurance products to clients and brokers. These ratings reflect the rating agency’s opinion of our reinsurance subsidiaries’ financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet obligations. It is not an evaluation directed toward the protection of investors or a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our Class A ordinary shares. 

The failure to maintain a strong rating may significantly and negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business —“A downgrade or withdrawal of either of our A.M. Best ratings may significantly and negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy successfully. ”
Regulations

Cayman Islands Insurance Regulation

The legislative framework for conducting insurance and reinsurance business in and from within the Cayman Islands is composed of The Insurance Law, 2010 (as amended) and underlying regulations thereto (the “Law”) which was brought into force in the Cayman Islands effective as of November 1, 2012. 
Greenlight Re holds a Class D insurer license issued in accordance with the terms of the Law and is subject to regulation by CIMA.
As the holder of a Class D insurer license, Greenlight Re is permitted to carry on reinsurance business from the Cayman Islands, but, except with the prior written approval of CIMA, may not carry on any insurance or reinsurance business where the underlying risk originates and resides in the Cayman Islands.

Greenlight Re is required to comply with the following principal requirements under the Law: 
11


● | to maintain capital and a margin of solvency in accordance with the capital and solvency requirements prescribed by the Law;

● | to submit to CIMA an annual return in the prescribed form together with: 
 | - financial statements prepared in accordance with any internationally recognized accounting standards, audited by an independent auditor approved by CIMA; 
 | - an actuarial valuation of Greenlight Re’s assets and liabilities, certified by an actuary approved by CIMA; 
 | - certification of solvency prepared by a person approved by CIMA in accordance with the prescribed requirements; 
 | - confirmation that the information contained in Greenlight Re’s license application, as modified by any subsequent changes, remains correct; 
 | - such other information as may be prescribed by CIMA; and 
● | to pay an annual license fee. 

It is the duty of CIMA: 

● | to maintain a general review of insurance practices in the Cayman Islands; 
● | to examine the affairs or business of any licensee or other person carrying on, or who has carried on, insurance business in order to ensure that the Law has been complied with and that the licensee is in a sound financial position and is carrying on its business in a fit and proper manner;
● | to examine and report on the annual returns delivered to CIMA in terms of the Law; and 
● | to examine and make recommendations with respect to, among other things, proposals for the revocation of licenses and cases of suspected insolvency of licensed entities. 


Greenlight Re is also required to comply with the Rule on Corporate Governance for Insurers and the Rule on Risk Management for Insurers. Respectively, these rules require regulated insurers to establish and maintain (a) a corporate governance framework which provides for the sound and prudent management and oversight of the insurer's business, including outsourcing and internal controls, and which adequately recognizes and protects the interests of its policyholders, and (b) a risk management framework that is capable of promptly identifying, measuring, assessing, reporting, monitoring and controlling all sources of risks that could have a material impact on its operations in a timely manner.
Where CIMA believes that a licensee is committing, or is about to commit or pursue, an act that is an unsafe or unsound business practice, CIMA may direct the licensee to cease or refrain from committing the act or pursuing the offending course of conduct. Failure to comply with such a CIMA direction may be punishable on summary conviction by a fine of up to 100,000 Cayman Islands dollars (which is approximately US$120,000) or to imprisonment for a term of five years or to both, and on conviction on indictment to a fine of 500,000 Cayman Islands dollars (which is approximately US$600,000) or to imprisonment for a term of ten years or to both and to an additional 10,000 Cayman Islands dollars (which is approximately US$12,000) for every day after conviction that the breach continues.

In addition, CIMA may impose fines and penalties on a licensee in certain circumstances, ranging from a fixed fine of 5,000 Cayman Islands dollars (which is approximately US$6,000) or a discretionary fine depending on the severity of the breach. Regulations passed under the Monetary Authority Law determine the circumstances under which CIMA can impose administrative fines. Under the current regulations, administrative fines can only be imposed for breaches of the Cayman Islands anti-money laundering regime (the "AML regime") and, as a reinsurance business, the AML regime does not apply to Greenlight Re. However, the circumstances in which fines can be imposed may be expanded in future years.

Whenever CIMA believes that a licensee is or may become unable to meet its obligations as they fall due, is carrying on business in a manner likely to be detrimental to the public interest or to the interest of its creditors or policyholders, has contravened the terms of the Law or has otherwise behaved in such a manner so as to cause CIMA to call into question the licensee’s fitness, CIMA may take one of a number of steps, including requiring the licensee to take steps to rectify the matter, suspending the license of the licensee, revoking the license, imposing conditions upon the license and amending or revoking any such condition, requiring the substitution of any director, manager or officer of the licensee, at the expense of the licensee, appointing a person to advise the licensee on the proper conduct of its affairs and to report to CIMA thereon, at the expense of the licensee, appointing a person to assume control of the licensee’s affairs or otherwise requiring such action to be taken by the licensee as CIMA considers necessary. To date, we have not been subject to any such actions from CIMA. 
Other Regulations in the Cayman Islands

As Cayman Islands exempted companies, Greenlight Capital Re and Greenlight Re may not carry on business or trade locally in the Cayman Islands except in furtherance of their business outside the Cayman Islands, and are prohibited from soliciting the public of the Cayman Islands to subscribe for any of their securities or debt. We are further required to file a return with the Registrar of Companies in January of each year and to pay an annual registration fee at that time.

The Cayman Islands has no exchange controls restricting dealings in currencies or securities.
Ireland Insurance Regulations
Our Irish subsidiary, GRIL, is authorized as a non-life reinsurance undertaking by the CBI in accordance with the European Union (Insurance and Reinsurance) Regulations 2015 (the "Irish Regulations"). The Irish Regulations give effect in Ireland to EU Directive 2009/138/EC (known as "Solvency II"), which introduced a new European regulatory regime for insurers and reinsurers with effect from January 1, 2016. Solvency II is supplemented by the European Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35, other European Commission “delegated acts” and binding technical standards, and guidelines issued by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (“Delegated Acts and Guidelines”). GRIL is required to comply at all times with the Irish Regulations, the Irish Insurance Acts 1909 to 2018, regulations relating to insurance business or reinsurance business promulgated under the European Communities Act 1972, the Irish Central Bank Acts 1942 to 2015 as amended, regulations promulgated thereunder and directions, guidelines and codes of conduct issued by CBI (collectively the “Irish Insurance Acts and Regulations”). In addition, GRIL is required to comply with the Delegated Acts and Guidelines and must meet risk-based solvency requirements imposed under Solvency II on insurers and reinsurers across all member states, including Ireland. Solvency II and the Delegated Acts and Guidelines set out classification and eligibility requirements, including the characteristics which capital, including any capital contribution, must display to qualify as regulatory capital.
GRIL is also required to comply with the European Union (Insurance Distribution) Regulations 2018 (the "2018 Regulations") which apply to distributors of insurance and reinsurance products (including insurers and reinsurers). The 2018 Regulations give effect in Ireland to Directive (EU) 2016/97 (known as the "IDD") and strengthen the regulatory regime applicable to distribution activities through increased transparency, information and conduct requirements. As of 25 May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR") came into force across the EU. The GDPR significantly increases the obligations and responsibilities for organizations in how they collect, use and protect personal data. Organizations in breach of the GDPR may incur sizable financial penalties.
Overview of Investments

Our investment portfolio is managed by DME Advisors, a value-oriented investment advisor that analyzes companies’ available financial data, business strategies and prospects in an effort to identify undervalued and overvalued securities. DME Advisors is controlled by David Einhorn, the Chairman of our Board of Directors and the President of Greenlight Capital, Inc. Effective January 1, 2017, we entered into the venture agreement wherein the Company, Greenlight Re, GRIL, and DME became participants in the Joint Venture for the purposes of managing certain jointly held assets. Simultaneously with the venture agreement, we entered into an amended and restated investment advisory agreement (the “advisory agreement”) with DME Advisors to provide discretionary advisory services relating to the assets and liabilities of the venture. The advisory agreement term period mirrored that of the venture agreement.
On September 1, 2018, we entered into the SILP LPA whereby DME II is the General Partner and Greenlight Re and GRIL are the limited partners. The SILP LPA, in conjunction with a participation agreement, replaced the venture agreement and transferred Greenlight Re’s and GRIL’s invested assets from the Joint Venture to SILP. The Joint Venture was terminated on January 2, 2019.
13

On September 1, 2018, SILP entered into the IAA with DME Advisors with an initial term ending on August 31, 2023, subject to automatic extensions for successive three-year terms. Pursuant to the SILP LPA and the IAA, DME Advisors has the exclusive right to manage substantially all of our investable assets, subject to the investment guidelines adopted by the respective Boards of Directors of Greenlight Re and GRIL. DME Advisors receives a monthly management fee at an annual rate of 1.5% of each limited partner’s Investment Portfolio, as provided in the SILP LPA. In addition, DME II receives a performance allocation based on the positive performance change of each limited partner’s capital account equal to 20% of net profits calculated per annum, subject to a loss carry forward provision.
The loss carry forward provision allows DME II to earn a reduced performance allocation of 10% on net profits in any year subsequent to the year in which a limited partner’s capital accounts incurs a loss, until all the losses are recouped and an additional amount equal to 150% of the loss is earned. DME II is not entitled to a performance allocation in a year in which a capital account incurs a loss.

DME Advisors is required to follow our investment guidelines and act in a manner that it considers fair and equitable in allocating investment opportunities to us and SILP, but the IAA does not otherwise impose any specific obligations or requirements concerning the allocation of time, effort or investment opportunities to us and SILP or any restrictions on the nature or timing of investments for our or SILP’s account, or other accounts that DME Advisors or its affiliates may manage. In addition, DME Advisors can outsource to sub-advisors without our consent or approval. In the event that DME Advisors and any of its affiliates attempt to simultaneously invest in the same opportunity, the opportunity may be allocated pro-rata as reasonably determined by DME Advisors and its affiliates. Affiliates of DME Advisors presently serve as general partner or investment advisor of Greenlight Capital, L.P., Greenlight Capital Qualified, L.P., Greenlight Capital Offshore, Ltd., Greenlight Capital Offshore Qualified, Ltd., Greenlight Capital Offshore Partners, Greenlight Capital Investors, L.P., Greenlight Capital Offshore Investors, Ltd., Greenlight Capital Offshore Master, Ltd., Greenlight Masters, L.P., Greenlight Masters Qualified, L.P., Greenlight Masters Offshore, Ltd., Greenlight Masters Offshore I, Ltd., Greenlight Masters Offshore Partners and Greenlight Masters Partners (collectively, the “Greenlight Funds”). 

We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all of our current and future subsidiaries to enter into the SILP LPA. Under the SILP LPA, we are contractually obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause substantially all investable assets of Greenlight Re and GRIL, with limited exceptions, to be contributed to SILP. 

We have agreed to release DME, DME II and DME Advisors and their affiliates from, and to indemnify and hold them harmless against, any liability arising out of the venture agreement and the advisory agreement, subject to certain exceptions. Furthermore, DME, DME II and DME Advisors and their affiliates have agreed to indemnify us against any liability incurred in connection with certain actions. 

In accordance with the SILP LPA, either of the GLRE Limited Partners may voluntarily withdraw all or part of its Capital Account for its operating needs by giving DME II at least 3 business days notice. In addition, either of the GLRE Limited Partners may withdraw as a partner and fully withdraw all of its Capital Account from SILP on 3 business days notice if the Board of the limited partner declares that a cause for withdrawal exists as per the SILP LPA.
Investment Strategy

DME Advisors implements a value-oriented investment strategy by taking long positions in perceived undervalued securities and short positions in perceived overvalued securities. DME Advisors aims to achieve high absolute rates of return while minimizing the risk of capital loss. DME Advisors attempts to determine the risk/return characteristics of potential investments by analyzing factors such as the risk that expected cash flows will not be obtained, the volatility of the cash flows, the leverage of the underlying business and the security’s liquidity, among others.

Our Board of Directors conducts reviews of our investment portfolio activities and oversees our investment guidelines to meet our investment objectives. We believe our investment approach, while less predictable than traditional fixed-income portfolios, complements our reinsurance business and will achieve higher rates of return over the long term than reinsurance companies that invest predominantly in fixed-income securities. Our investment guidelines are designed to maintain adequate liquidity to fund our reinsurance operations and to protect against unexpected events.

DME Advisors, which is contractually obligated to adhere to our investment guidelines, makes investment decisions on our behalf, which may include buying publicly listed equity securities and corporate debt, selling securities short and investing in private placements, futures, currencies, commodities, credit default swaps, interest rate swaps, sovereign debt, derivatives and other instruments. As of December 31, 2018, DME Advisors was in compliance with our investment guidelines.

Investment Guidelines

The investment guidelines adopted by the respective Boards of Directors of Greenlight Re and GRIL, which may be amended or modified from time to time, take into account restrictions imposed on us by regulators, our liability mix, requirements to maintain an appropriate claims paying rating by ratings agencies and requirements of lenders.
As of the date hereof, Greenlight Re’s investment guidelines, which may be amended by the board of directors of Greenlight Re at any time, are as follows:

● | Composition of Investments: At least 80% of the assets in its Investment Portfolio (as defined in the Limited Partnership Agreement) will be held in debt or equity securities (including swaps) of publicly-traded companies (or their subsidiaries), governments of the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development high income countries, cash, cash equivalents and gold. No more than 10% of the assets in its Investment Portfolio will be held in private equity securities.
● | Concentration of Investments: Other than cash, cash equivalents, United States government obligations and gold, no single investment in its Investment Portfolio will constitute more than 20% of the Investment Portfolio. 
● | Liquidity: Assets will be invested in such fashion that Greenlight Re has a reasonable expectation that it can meet any of its liabilities as they become due. Greenlight Re will review with the Investment Advisor the liquidity of the portfolio on a periodic basis. 
● | Monitoring: Greenlight Re will require the Investment Advisor to re-evaluate each position in its Investment Portfolio and to monitor changes in intrinsic value and trading value and provide monthly reports on its Investment Portfolio to Greenlight Re as Greenlight Re may reasonably determine. 
● | Leverage: Greenlight Re’s Investment Portfolio may not employ greater than 15% indebtedness for borrowed money, including net margin balances, for extended time periods. The Investment Advisor may employ, in the normal course of business, up to 30% indebtedness for periods of less than 30 days. 
Currency hedging activities are excluded from leverage calculations. Where the Investment Advisor enters into a secondary investment with the primary purpose of reducing the risk of another existing investment then the investment advisor may exclude the secondary investment from the calculation of leverage provided that the Investment Advisor receives approval from Greenlight Re’s Chief Financial Officer. Such authority is limited such that no more than 10% of indebtedness may be excluded from leverage calculations for such secondary investments. 

The investment guidelines for GRIL are identical to Greenlight Re’s except for Concentration of Investments and Leverage, which for GRIL are as follows:


● | Concentration of Investments: Other than cash, cash equivalents and United States government obligations, (1) no single investment in its Investment Portfolio will constitute more than 10% of its Investment Portfolio, (2) the 10 largest investments shall not constitute greater than 50% of its total Investment Portfolio, and (3) its Investment Portfolio shall at all times be composed of a minimum of 50 debt or equity securities of publicly traded companies (or their subsidiaries).
● | Leverage: GRIL’s Investment Portfolio may not employ greater than 5% indebtedness for borrowed money, including net margin balances, for extended time periods. The Investment Advisor may use, in the normal course of business, an aggregate of up to 20% net margin leverage for periods of less than 30 days. 

Additionally, GRIL's investment guidelines prohibit the sale of credit default swaps.

    DME Advisors also reports the composition of SILP’s portfolio on a delta adjusted basis, which it believes is the appropriate manner in which to assess the exposure and profile of investments and is the way in which it manages the portfolio. The delta of an option is the sensitivity of the option price to the underlying stock (or commodity) price. The delta adjusted basis is the number of shares underlying the option multiplied by the delta and the underlying stock (or commodity) price.
This exposure analysis does not include cash (U.S. dollar and foreign currencies), gold and other commodities, credit default swaps, sovereign debt, foreign currency derivatives, interest rate options and other macro positions. In addition, under this methodology, the exposure for total return swaps is reported at its full notional amount. Options are reported at their delta adjusted basis.

Investment Returns

In accordance with the SILP LPA, DME Advisors constructs a levered investment portfolio as agreed with the Company (the “Investment Portfolio” as defined in the SILP LPA). Effective from September 1, 2018, the investment return is calculated by dividing the investment income or loss (net of fees and expenses) by the Investment Portfolio. Our investment return is based on the total assets in our Investment Portfolio. Investment returns, net of all fees and expenses, by quarter and for the last five years are as follows: (1)

Quarter | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | 2015 | | 2014
1st | (11.8 | )% | | 0.9 | % | 2.5 | % | | (1.8 | )% | (0.7 | )%
2nd | (3.8 | ) | | (3.4 | ) | (3.4 | ) | | (1.5 | ) | 8.1 | 
3rd | (8.4 | ) | | 5.5 | | 3.1 | | | (14.2 | ) | (3.7 | ) 
4th | (10.2 | ) | | (1.3 | ) | 5.0 | | | (4.0 | ) | 5.3 | 
Full Year | (30.3 | )% | | 1.5 | % | 7.2 | % | | (20.2 | )% | 8.7 | % 


    (1)    Investment returns are calculated monthly based on cash flows into and out of the investment accounts and compounded to calculate the quarterly and annual returns generated by our Investment Portfolio. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. 

DME Advisors and its affiliates manage and expect to manage other client accounts besides SILP’s, some of which may have objectives similar to SILP’s. Further, DME Advisors and its affiliates provide their clients, including us, with results of their respective investment portfolios on the last day of each month. In order to ensure that other clients of DME Advisors do not indirectly have access to material non-public information regarding SILP’s investment performance, we present, prior to the start of trading on the first business day of each month, SILP’s largest disclosed long positions, a summary of our consolidated net investment returns, information on SILP’s long and short exposures and from time to time certain other material information relating to SILP’s investment portfolio, on our website, www.greenlightre.com. DME Advisors may choose not to disclose 
17

certain positions to its clients in order to protect its investment strategy. Therefore, we present on our website the largest positions held by SILP that are disclosed by DME Advisors or its affiliates to their other clients.
Internal Risk Management

Our Chief Risk Officer is responsible for the construction and review of our internal risk management function. A primary objective of our risk management function is to ensure that our underwriting efforts comply with explicitly stated underwriting appetites. These appetites, in turn, are designed to balance our risk position size with our expertise and the available margins, while containing the cost of being wrong. In doing so, our risk management function designs, implements and oversees a range of operational and underwriting controls to support the organization. We frequently review our investment and underwriting portfolios to assess the impact to capital under stressed scenarios. With the assistance of DME Advisors, we analyze both our investment assets and liabilities including the numerous components of risk in our portfolio, such as concentration risk and liquidity risk.
Information Technology
Our information technology infrastructure is primarily housed in Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands. We have implemented backup procedures to ensure that data is saved on a daily basis and can be restored in an appropriate time frame as needed.

We have a disaster recovery plan with respect to our information technology infrastructure that includes data and systems replication between our Cayman Islands office and Dublin office and other off-site locations. We believe we can access our core systems with insignificant outages and restore operation of our secondary systems in the event that our primary systems are unavailable due to a disaster or otherwise.
Employees

As of December 31, 2018, we had 36 full-time employees, 28 who were based in Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands and 8 who were based in Dublin, Ireland. We believe that our employee relations are good. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements, and we are not aware of any current efforts to implement such agreements.
Additional Information

Our website address is www.greenlightre.com and we make available, free of charge, on or through our website, links to our annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and other documents we file with or furnish to the SEC, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. In order to comply with Regulation FD, our investment returns are posted on our website on a monthly basis. Additionally, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available on our website. 
Glossary of Selected Reinsurance Terms

18


Casualty clash | Casualty clash primarily covers a single third party event that can affect multiple casualty policies. For example, a collapse of a building could give rise to a multiple claims under Engineering Errors and Omissions, Architect’s Errors and Omissions, and General Liability policies. The combined losses for all affected policies could give rise to a casualty clash loss. 
Casualty reinsurance | Casualty reinsurance is primarily concerned with the losses caused by injuries to third persons (persons other than the policyholder) and the legal liability imposed on the policyholder resulting therefrom. This includes, but is not limited to workers’ compensation, automobile liability, and general liability. A greater degree of unpredictability is generally associated with casualty risks known as ‘‘long-tail risks,’’ where losses take time to become known and a claim may be separated from the circumstances that caused it by several years. An example of a long-tail casualty risk includes the use of certain drugs that may cause cancer or birth defects. There tends to be greater delay in the reporting and settlement of casualty reinsurance claims due to the long-tail nature of the underlying casualty risks and their greater potential for litigation.
Catastrophe | A severe loss, typically involving multiple claimants. Common perils include earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, hailstorms, tornados, severe winter weather, floods, fires, explosions, volcanic eruptions and other natural or man-made disasters. Catastrophe losses may also arise from acts of war, acts of terrorism and political instability. 
Cede; cedent | When a party reinsures its liability to another party, it ‘‘cedes’’ business to the reinsurer and is referred to as the ‘‘client.’’ 
Claim | Request by an insured or reinsured for indemnification by an insurance or reinsurance company for loss incurred from an insured peril or event. 
Client | A party whose liability is reinsured by a reinsurer. Also known as a cedent.

Co-participation | The payment by the insured of a predetermined proportion of all losses above the predetermined amount. 
Corporate expenses | Corporate expenses include those costs associated with operating as a publicly listed entity as well as an allocation of other general and administrative expenses. 
Development | The difference between the amount of reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses initially estimated by an insurer or reinsurer and the amount re-estimated in an evaluation at a later date. 
Excess of loss reinsurance | Reinsurance that indemnifies the reinsured against all or a specified portion of losses in excess of a specified dollar or percentage loss ratio amount.

Incurred but not reported (IBNR) | Reserves for estimated loss and loss adjustment expenses that have been incurred by insureds and reinsureds but not yet reported to the insurer or reinsurer, including unknown future developments on loss and loss adjustment expenses which are known to the insurer or reinsurer. 
Internal expense ratio | A ratio calculated by dividing general and administrative expenses by premiums earned. 
Loss adjustment expenses (LAE) | The expenses of settling claims, including legal and other fees and the portion of general expenses allocated to claim settlement costs. Also known as claim adjustment expenses.

19


Loss reserves and loss adjustment expense reserves | Liabilities established by insurers and reinsurers to reflect the estimated cost of claims payments and the related expenses that the insurer or reinsurer will ultimately be required to pay in respect of insurance or reinsurance contracts it has written. Reserves are established for losses and for loss adjustment expenses, and consist of reserves established with respect to individual reported claims and incurred but not reported losses. 
Medical malpractice insurance | Medical malpractice insurance provides an indemnity to physicians and their employees for losses related to patient injuries arising from medical advice rendered or procedures performed. 
Multi-line | Contracts that cover more than one line of business. 
Net financial impact | The net impact of prior period loss development after taking into account net losses and loss expenses incurred, earned reinstatement premiums assumed and ceded, and adjustments to assumed and ceded acquisition costs and profit commissions. 
Net premiums written | An insurer’s gross premiums written less premiums ceded to reinsurers. 
Non-admitted insurers | An insurer not licensed to do business in the jurisdiction in question. Also known as an unauthorized insurer and unlicensed insurer. 
Premiums; written, earned and unearned | Premiums represent the cost of insurance that is paid by the cedent or insured to the insurer or reinsurer. Written represents the complete amount of premiums received, and earned represents the amount recognized as income over a period of time. Unearned is the difference between written and earned premiums. 
Probable maximum loss (PML) | PML is the anticipated loss, taking into account contract terms and limits, caused by a natural catastrophe affecting a broad geographic area, such as that caused by an earthquake or hurricane. 
Professional liability insurance | Professional liability insurance protects a company and its representatives against legal claims arising from error or misconduct in providing or failing to provide professional services.

Property insurance | Property insurance covers a business’s building and its contents—money and securities, records, inventory, furniture, machinery, supplies and even intangible assets such as trademarks—when damage, theft or loss occurs. 
Property catastrophe reinsurance | Property catastrophe reinsurance contracts are typically ‘‘all risk’’ in nature, meaning that they protect against losses from natural and/or man-made catastrophes. Losses on these contracts typically stem from direct property damage and business interruption. 
Proportional reinsurance | All forms of reinsurance in which the reinsurer shares a proportional part of the original premiums and losses of the reinsured.
