ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview 
 We are a radio broadcasting company whose primary business is operating radio stations throughout the United States. We own and operate 64 radio stations in the following radio markets: Atlanta, GA, Augusta, GA, Boston, MA, Charlotte, NC, Detroit, MI, Fayetteville, NC, Fort Myers-Naples, FL, Las Vegas, NV, Middlesex, NJ, Monmouth, NJ, Morristown, NJ, Philadelphia, PA, Tampa-Saint Petersburg, FL, West Palm Beach-Boca Raton, FL, and Wilmington, DE. We refer to each group of radio stations in each radio market as a market cluster. Beasley Broadcast Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed in 1999. 
Acquisition of Greater Media, Inc. 
 On November 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Greater Media, Inc. (Greater Media), pursuant to the merger agreement, dated as of July 19, 2016 by and among the Company, Greater Media, Beasley Media Group 2, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (Merger Sub), and Peter A. Bordes, Jr., as the Stockholders Representative (the Merger Agreement). On the Closing Date, Merger Sub was merged with and into Greater Media, with Greater Media surviving the merger as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the Merger). As a result of the Merger, the Company added 21 radio stations in the Boston, MA, Detroit, MI, Charlotte, NC, Middlesex, NJ, Monmouth, NJ, Morristown, NJ and Philadelphia, PA markets. 
Strategy 
 We seek to secure and maintain a leadership position in the markets we serve by developing market-leading clusters of radio stations in each of our markets. We operate our radio stations in clusters to capture a variety of demographic listener groups, which we believe enhances our radio stations appeal to a wide range of advertisers. In addition, we have been able to achieve operating efficiencies by consolidating office and studio space where possible to minimize duplicative management positions and reduce overhead expenses. Current FCC rules and regulations do not permit us to add more AM or FM radio stations to our Augusta, GA market cluster, or more FM radio stations to our Boston, MA, Charlotte, NC, Fayetteville, NC, Fort Myers-Naples, FL, Philadelphia, PA, and Tampa-Saint Petersburg, FL market clusters. 
Competition 
 The radio broadcasting industry is highly competitive. Our radio stations compete for listeners and advertising revenue with other radio stations within their respective markets. In addition, our radio stations compete with other media such as broadcast and cable television, newspapers and magazines, outdoor advertising, direct mail, internet radio, satellite radio, smart phones, tablets, and other wireless media, the internet, social media such as Facebook and Twitter, and other forms of advertising. 
 The following are some of the factors that we believe are important to a radio stations competitive position: (i) audience ratings; (ii) program content; (iii) management experience; (iv) sales experience; (v) audience characteristics; and (vi) the number and characteristics of other radio stations and other advertising media in the market area. We attempt to improve our competitive position with promotional campaigns aimed at the demographic groups targeted by our radio stations and by sales efforts designed to attract advertisers. We conduct extensive market research in an effort to enhance our audience ratings and, in certain circumstances, to identify opportunities to reformat radio stations to reach underserved demographic groups and increase advertising revenue. 
 Federal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting 
 The radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive and changing federal regulations administered by the Federal Communications Commission (the FCC). Among other things, the FCC: 
 

 | determines the particular frequencies, locations, operating powers and other technical parameters of radio stations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | issues, renews, revokes, conditions and modifies radio station licenses;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | determines whether to approve changes in ownership or control of radio station licenses;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | regulates equipment used by radio stations; and
--+------------------------------------------------


 | adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership, operation, program content and employment practices of radio stations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FCC has the power to impose penalties for violations of its rules that are implemented pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act), including the imposition of monetary forfeitures, the issuance of short-term licenses, the imposition of conditions on the renewal of a license, and, in egregious cases, non-renewal of licenses and the revocation of licenses. 
 The following is a brief summary of some provisions of the Communications Act and of certain specific FCC rules and policies. The summary is not a comprehensive listing of all of the regulations and policies affecting radio stations. For further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of radio stations, you should refer to the Communications Act, FCC rules and FCC public notices, reports, orders and rulings. 
 FCC Licenses.    Radio stations operate pursuant to broadcasting licenses that are ordinarily granted by the FCC for renewable terms of eight years. A radio station may continue to operate beyond the expiration date of its license if a timely filed license renewal application is pending. During the period following the filing of renewal applications, petitions to deny license renewals can be filed by interested parties, including members of the public. Generally, the FCC renews a broadcast license upon a finding that (i) the broadcast station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; (ii) there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the FCCs rules; and (iii) there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or other FCC rules which, taken together, indicate a pattern of abuse. Historically, FCC licenses have generally been renewed. The most recent renewal cycle started in June 2011 and concluded in April 2014. A new renewal cycle will begin in June 2019 and conclude in April 2022. The non-renewal of one or more of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 The FCC classifies each AM and FM radio station. An AM radio station operates on either a clear channel, regional channel or local channel. A clear channel is one on which AM radio stations are assigned to serve wide areas, particularly at night. The minimum and maximum facilities requirements for an FM radio station are determined by its class. Possible FM class designations depend upon the geographic zone in which the transmitter of the FM radio station is located. In general, commercial FM radio stations are classified as follows, in order of increasing power and antenna height: Class A, B1, C3, B, C2, C1, C0, or C. 
 Several years ago, the FCC authorized an additional 100 kHz of bandwidth for the AM band and has allotted frequencies in this new band to certain existing AM radio station licensees that applied for migration to the expanded AM band, including one of our radio stations, subject to the requirement that at the end of a transition period, those licensees return to the FCC the license for one of the AM band radio stations. Upon the completion of the migration process, it is expected that some AM radio stations will have improved coverage because of reduced interference. We have not completed our evaluation of the impact of the migration process on our operations but believe that such impact will not be significant. Current FCC requirements call for surrender of either the expanded band license or the existing band license. This surrender obligation is currently suspended. As part of an Order released in October 2015 with respect to revitalization of the AM band (the AM Improvement Order) the FCC adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on its tentative conclusion that licensees that have not yet surrendered one of their licenses be required to do so. The surrender of either license will have no material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. As part of the AM Improvement Order, the FCC also launched a Notice of Inquiry with respect to the AM expanded band. The NOI sought comments regarding the FCCs tentative conclusion that AM expanded band licenses should be made available to additional stations and whether technical parameters applicable to expanded band stations should be modified. In October 2018, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking as part of its AM revitalization efforts that proposes to decrease the protections afforded to Class A AM stations, also known as clear channel AM stations. These stations are high-powered (broadcasting with 50 kilowatts) and receive broad interference protections during the daytime and nighttime, and, because of the technical characteristics of the AM band, can often be heard thousands of miles from their transmitter sites during nighttime hours. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking questions whether the interference protections afforded to clear channel Class A stations remain necessary and suggests that eliminating some of the protections would allow certain AM stations who provide localized service to increase power. 
 The FCC also permits AM and FM radio stations to operate FM translators and FM stations to operate FM booster stations. These are low power secondary stations that retransmit the programming of a radio station to portions of the stations service area that the primary signal does not reach because of distance or terrain barriers. Boosters operate on the same frequency as the station being retransmitted and translators operate on a different frequency. 
 The AM Improvement Order implemented several rule changes impacting the technical operations of AM stations, including relaxation of the daytime community coverage requirements and elimination of the nighttime community coverage requirements for existing AM stations. In addition, in an effort to increase the number of FM translators that are available for AM stations, the FCC authorized two specialized FM translator filing windows for AM stations. During these windows an AM station was permitted to modify one FM translator to move it up to 250 miles from its authorized site and operate the translator on any non-reserved band FM channel in the AM stations market, subject to coverage and interference rules. AM stations that received an FM translator station license pursuant to one of the windows are required to rebroadcast the paired AM station on the modified FM translator for four years. Several of our AM Stations filed applications during these windows and received licenses for translators. Following the conclusion of the two windows permitting existing translators to be modified, the FCC opened two windows for AM stations that did not participate in the modification windows to apply for new translators. We acquired a translator for one of our AM stations during the first window. Because translators are secondary to full power stations, it is possible that translators we operate could be displaced by full power stations.

 The FCC has adopted rules establishing a low power radio service. Low power FM stations operate in the existing FM radio band with a maximum operating power of 100 watts. FCC regulations regarding eligibility for and licensing of low power FM radio stations have expanded licensing opportunities for low power FM radio stations. Implementation of a low power radio service provides an additional audio programming service that could compete with our radio stations for listeners. 
 Indecency Regulation.    The FCCs rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent material between the hours of 6 am and 10 pm. Broadcasters risk of violating the prohibition on the broadcast of indecent material is increased by the vagueness of the FCCs definition of indecent material, coupled with the spontaneity of live programming. The FCC has expanded the breadth of indecency regulation to include material that could be considered blasphemy, personally reviling epithets, profanity and vulgar or coarse words, amounting to a nuisance. The maximum permitted fine for an indecency violation is $407,270 per incident and $3,759,410 for any continuing violation arising from a single act or failure to act. Because the FCC may investigate indecency complaints prior to notifying a licensee of the existence of a complaint, a licensee may not have knowledge of a complaint unless and until the complaint results in the issuance of a formal FCC letter of inquiry or notice of apparent liability for forfeiture. In July 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued a decision finding that the FCCs indecency standard was too vague for broadcasters to interpret and therefore inconsistent with the First Amendment. In June 2012, the Supreme Court issued a decision which held that the FCC could not fine ABC and FOX for the specific broadcasts at issue in the case because the FCC had not provided them with sufficient notice of its intent to issue fines for the use of fleeting expletives. However, the Court did not make any substantive ruling regarding the FCCs indecency standards. In April 2013, the FCC requested comments on its indecency policy, including whether it should ban the use of fleeting expletives or whether it should only impose fines for broadcasts that involve repeated and deliberate use of expletives. The FCC has advised that it will continue to pursue enforcement actions in egregious cases while it conducts its review of its indecency policies generally and in March 2015 issued a Notice of Apparent Liability for the then maximum forfeiture amount of $325,000 against a television station for violation of its indecency policy. We cannot predict whether Congress will consider or adopt further legislation in this area. 
 Transfers or Assignment of License.    The Communications Act prohibits the assignment of broadcast licenses or the transfer of control of a broadcast licensee without the prior approval of the FCC. In determining whether to grant such approval, the FCC considers, among other things: 
 

 | compliance with the various rules limiting common ownership of media properties in a given market;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the character of the proposed licensee and those persons holding attributable interests in the licensee; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | compliance with the Communications Acts limitations on alien ownership as well as compliance with other FCC regulations and policies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To obtain FCC consent to assign or transfer control of a broadcast license, appropriate applications must be filed with the FCC. Interested parties, including members of the public, have the opportunity to file objections against assignment and transfer of control applications. 
 Multiple Ownership Rules.    The Communications Act and FCC rules impose specific limits on the number of commercial radio stations an entity can own, directly or by attribution, in a single market and the combination of radio stations, television stations and newspapers that any entity can own, directly or by attribution, in a single market. Digital radio channels authorized for AM and FM stations do not count as separate stations for purposes of the ownership limits. The radio multiple-ownership rules may preclude us from acquiring certain radio stations we might otherwise seek to acquire. The ownership rules also effectively prevent us from selling radio stations in a market to a buyer that has reached its ownership limit in the market unless that buyer divests other radio stations. The FCCs ownership rules that are currently in effect and apply to our broadcast holdings are briefly summarized below. 
 Local Radio Ownership Rule.    The local radio ownership rule establishes the following limits: 
 

 | in markets with 45 or more radio stations, ownership is limited to eight commercial radio stations, no more than five of which can be either AM or FM;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | in markets with 30 to 44 radio stations, ownership is limited to seven commercial radio stations, no more than four of which can be either AM or FM;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | in markets with 15 to 29 radio stations, ownership is limited to six commercial radio stations, no more than four of which can be either AM or FM; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
5 


 
 | in markets with 14 or fewer radio stations, ownership is limited to five commercial radio stations or no more than 50% of the markets total, whichever is lower, and no more than three of which can be either AM or FM.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 For stations located in a market in which the Nielsen Audio ratings service provides ratings, the definition of radio market is based on the radio market to which BIA Kelsey reports assign the affected radio stations. For stations that are not in a Nielsen Audio market, the market definition is based on technical service areas. The FCCs rules also provide that parties which own groups of radio stations that comply with the previous (contour based) multiple ownership rules, but do not comply with the current limits, will be allowed to retain those groups on a grandfathered basis, but will not be allowed to transfer or assign those groups intact. Under these rules, our ability to transfer or assign our radio stations as a group to a single buyer in one of our current markets may be limited. 
 Ownership Attribution.    The FCC generally applies its ownership limits to attributable interests held by an individual, corporation, partnership or other entity. An attributable interest for purposes of the FCCs broadcast ownership rules generally includes: (i) equity and debt interests which combined exceed 33% of a licensees total assets, if the interest holder supplies more than 15% of the licensees total weekly programming, or has an attributable same-market media interest, whether television or radio; (ii) a 5% or greater direct or indirect voting stock interest, including certain interests held in trust, unless the holder is a qualified passive investor in which case the threshold is a 20% or greater voting stock interest; (iii) any equity interest in a limited liability company or a partnership, including a limited partnership, unless properly insulated from management activities; and (iv) any position as an officer or director of a licensee or its direct or indirect parent. In addition, the interests of minority shareholders in a corporation generally are not attributable if a single entity or individual controls 50% or more of that corporations voting stock. 
 Foreign Ownership Rules.    The Communications Act prohibits the issuance or holding of broadcast licenses by persons who are not U.S. citizens, whom the FCC rules refer to as aliens, including any corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country or of which more than 20% of its capital stock is owned or voted by aliens. In addition, the FCC may prohibit any corporation from holding a broadcast license if the corporation is controlled by any other corporation of which more than 25% of the capital stock is owned of record or voted by aliens. In the past, the FCC has interpreted the 25% foreign ownership limit for holding companies as an absolute prohibition. In November 2013, however, the FCC issued a Declaratory Ruling clarifying that it would review situations in which foreigners own more than 25% of a holding company of an entity that holds a broadcast license on a case by case basis. In 2016, the FCC adopted streamlined rules and procedures for the filing and review of requests to permit foreigners to own more than 25% of a holding companys equity. In acting upon a request for declaratory ruling, the FCC will coordinate with Executive Branch agencies on national security, law enforcement, foreign policy and other policy issues. The new rules also specify how public companies should monitor foreign ownership compliance and provide for remedial provisions in the event a public company determines that it has exceeded its foreign ownership limits. Broadcast licensees are required to obtain specific approval from the FCC before any foreign entity or individual acquires more than 5% of the licensees equity or voting rights. The streamlined rules permit a broadcast licensee to file a petition with the FCC seeking approval for a proposed foreign investor to own up to 100% of the controlling parent entity and for a non-controlling foreign investor identified in the petition to increase its equity and/or voting interest in a parent entity at a future time up to 49.9 percent. This change will make it easier for broadcast licensees to seek foreign investors. Our certificate of incorporation prohibits the ownership, voting and transfer of our capital stock in violation of the FCC restrictions, and prohibits the issuance of capital stock or the voting rights such capital stock represents to or for the account of aliens or corporations otherwise subject to domination or control by aliens in excess of the FCC limits. The certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to enforce these prohibitions. For example, the certificate of incorporation provides for the redemption of shares of our capital stock by action of the board of directors to the extent necessary to comply with these alien ownership restrictions. 
 Time Brokerage and Joint Sales Agreements.    It is not uncommon for radio stations to enter into agreements under which separately owned and licensed radio stations agree to enter into cooperative arrangements of varying sorts, subject to compliance with the requirements of antitrust laws and with FCCs rules and policies. Under these arrangements, separately-owned radio stations could agree to function cooperatively in programming, advertising sales and similar matters, subject to the requirement that the licensee of each radio station maintain independent control over the programming and operations of its own radio station. 
 The FCCs rules provide that a radio station that brokers more than 15% of the weekly broadcast time on another radio station serving the same market or sells more than 15% of the other stations advertising time per week will be considered to have an attributable ownership interest in the other radio station for purposes of the FCCs local radio ownership limits. 
 FCC rules also prohibit a broadcast station from duplicating more than 25% of its programming on another radio station in the same broadcast service, that is AM-AM or FM-FM, either through common ownership of the two radio stations or through a time brokerage agreement, where the brokered and brokering radio stations which it owns or programs serve substantially the same area. 
 Quadrennial Review of Ownership Rules.    The FCC is required to review quadrennially the media ownership rules to modify, repeal, or retain any rules as it determines to be in the public interest. In August 2016, the FCC released an Order in a proceeding that combined the 2010 and 2014 quadrennial reviews which retained most of the existing multiple ownership rules. The Order readopted an Order the FCC released in 2014 which confirmed that Joint Sales Agreements (JSAs) between separately owned television

  stations in the same market would be attributable to a station selling more than 15% of the other stations advertising time. The FCC adopted one change that applies to radio stations in embedded markets  smaller markets within the boundaries of larger markets. Previously, such stations had to comply with the local radio multiple ownership rules in both the smaller and larger markets. Under the revised rules, such stations can request that application of the rules to the larger market be waived if the larger market does not accurately reflect the competition faced by stations in the embedded market. Several parties filed petitions requesting the FCC to reconsider its August 2016 Order. In November 2017, the FCC released an Order on Reconsideration that eliminated the newspaper-broadcast and television-radio cross ownership rules, relaxed the local television ownership rule and eliminated the attribution of JSAs between television stations, but did not make any changes to the local radio rules other than with respect to stations in embedded markets. The rule changes went into effect on February 7, 2018. However, several public interest organizations filed petitions for review with the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the same court that has considered challenges to prior ownership orders issued by the FCC. Pursuant to a briefing scheduled adopted by the Third Circuit, briefs of the parties and intervenors will be filed by the end of March 2019. In December 2018, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to launch its 2018 quadrennial review of multiple ownership rules. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking does not make any proposals but seeks comment regarding whether the local radio ownership rule limits should be modified. We cannot predict whether the FCC will adopt changes to the local radio ownership rule that would impact our holdings. 
 Programming and Operations.    The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the public interest. The FCC gradually has relaxed or eliminated many of the more formalized procedures it had developed in the past to promote the broadcast of certain types of programming responsive to the needs of a radio stations community of license. Under the currently effective rules, a licensee is required to present programming that is responsive to issues of the radio stations community of license and to maintain records demonstrating this responsiveness. Under changes to the FCC rules implemented in 2017 and 2018, all of our radio stations are required to maintain their public inspection files online on an FCC maintained website rather than in their physical studios. This means that the materials in these stations public files are more widely accessible. Radio stations also must pay regulatory and application fees and follow various rules promulgated under the Communications Act. Those rules regulate, among other things, political advertising, sponsorship identifications, the advertisement of contests and lotteries, employment practices, broadcast of obscene and indecent content, and technical operations, including limits on human exposure to radio frequency radiation. 
 The FCCs rules on equal employment opportunities prohibit employment discrimination by radio stations on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, and gender; and require broadcasters to implement programs to promote equal employment opportunities at their radio stations. The rules generally require broadcasters to widely disseminate information about full-time job openings to all segments of the community to ensure that all qualified applicants have sufficient opportunity to apply for the job, to send job vacancy announcements to recruitment organizations and others in the community indicating an interest in all or some vacancies at the radio station, and to implement a number of specific longer-term recruitment outreach efforts, such as job fairs, internship programs, and interaction with educational and community groups from among a menu of approaches itemized by the FCC. In April 2017, the FCC issued a Declaratory Ruling permitting broadcast stations to use online job postings as their sole means of recruiting, as long as online postings reach all segments of a broadcasters community. 
 Proposed and Recent Changes.    Congress and the FCC are considering or may in the future consider and adopt new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect, directly or indirectly, the operation, ownership and profitability of our radio stations, including the loss of audience share and advertising revenues for our radio stations, and an inability to acquire additional radio stations or to finance those acquisitions. Such matters may include: 

 | changes in the FCCs multiple-ownership rules and attribution policies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | regulatory fees, spectrum use fees or other fees on FCC licenses;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | changes in laws with respect to foreign ownership of broadcast licenses;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | revisions to the FCCs rules relating to political broadcasting, including free airtime to candidates;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | technical and frequency allocation matters;
--+--------------------------------------------


 | proposals to restrict or prohibit the advertising of beer, wine and other alcoholic beverages on radio;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | proposals to restrict or prohibit the advertising of online casinos, online sports betting services and fantasy sports services;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | proposals to require radio broadcasters to pay royalties to musicians and record labels for the performance of music played on the stations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | proposals to limit the tax deductibility of or impose sales tax on advertising expenses by advertisers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
7 


 
 | proposals to regulate or prohibit payments to stations by independent record promoters, record labels and others for the inclusion of specific content in broadcast programming; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | proposals in legislation to strengthen protections against online infringement of intellectual property that would impose criminal penalties on content providers, including broadcasters, that fail to comply with legal requirements to file reports regarding internet streaming in a timely manner.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FCC has also adopted procedures for the auction of broadcast spectrum in circumstances where two or more parties have filed for new or major change applications that are mutually exclusive. Such procedures may limit our efforts to modify or expand the broadcast signals of our radio stations. 
 Federal legislation was enacted in February 2012 that, among other things, authorizes the FCC to conduct voluntary incentive auctions in order to reallocate certain spectrum currently occupied by television broadcast stations to mobile wireless broadband services, to repack television stations into a smaller portion of the existing television spectrum band, and to require certain television stations that do not relinquish spectrum in the auction to modify their transmission facilities, subject to reimbursement for reasonable relocation costs. 
 The FCC adopted rules concerning the incentive auction for broadcast television spectrum and the repacking of the television band. Under the auction rules implemented by the FCC, television stations were given an opportunity to offer spectrum for sale to the government in a reverse auction while wireless providers bid to acquire spectrum from the government in a related forward auction. The incentive auction concluded in April 2017 when the FCC issued a Public Notice announcing the television stations that had relinquished spectrum in the auction and the stations that are being repacked to different channels and establishing deadlines for stations being repacked to file applications to modify their facilities and complete construction of authorized repacked facilities. The FCC will reimburse stations for reasonable relocation costs. The original reimbursement limit across all stations was $1.75 billion. However, in March 2018, Congress authorized an additional $1.0 billion to be used for reimbursements related to repacking and directed that of that amount not more than $50.0 million of that amount could be used to reimburse FM stations that share towers with television stations being repacked and are required to modify their facilities on a temporary or permanent basis to accommodate changes made by the television stations. In August 2018, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to adopt procedures to implement reimbursements to FM stations as well as to low power television and television translator stations that will be displaced, which is pending. In connection with the repacking process as required by the FCC it is possible that some of our FM stations will be required to operate from interim facilities during the period that television stations that they share tower space with are modifying their facilities. 
 We cannot predict what other matters might be considered in the future by the FCC or Congress, nor can we judge in advance what impact, if any, the implementation of any of these proposals or changes might have on our business. 
 Federal Antitrust Laws.    The agencies responsible for enforcing the federal antitrust laws, the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice, may investigate certain acquisitions. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific FTC or Department of Justice investigation. Any decision by the FTC or the Department of Justice to challenge a proposed acquisition could affect our ability to consummate the acquisition or to consummate it on the proposed terms. 
 For an acquisition meeting certain size thresholds, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 requires the parties to file Notification and Report Forms concerning antitrust issues with the FTC and the Department of Justice and to observe specified waiting period requirements before consummating the acquisition. 
 HD Radio 
 The FCC selected In-Band On-Channel technology as the exclusive technology for introduction of terrestrial digital operations by AM and FM radio stations. The technology is also known as HD Radio. The advantages of digital audio broadcasting over traditional analog broadcasting technology include improved sound quality, the ability to broadcast additional channels, and the ability to offer a greater variety of auxiliary services. We currently utilize HD Radio digital technology on most of our stations. 
 Seasonality 
 Seasonal revenue fluctuations are common in the radio broadcasting industry and are due primarily to fluctuations in advertising expenditures. Our net revenues are typically lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year.

 Employees 
 As of February 8, 2019, we had a staff of 810 full-time employees and 678 part-time employees. We are a party to two separate collective bargaining agreements with the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. These agreements apply only to certain of our employees at two radio station in Philadelphia. One of the collective bargaining agreements expires on March 31, 2019 then automatically renews for successive one-year periods unless either party gives a notice of proposed termination at least sixty days prior to a renewal date while the other agreement automatically renews for successive one-year periods unless either party gives a notice of proposed termination at least sixty days prior to a renewal date. We are also a party to a collective bargaining agreement with the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America Local 262. This agreement applies only to certain of our employees at one radio station in Boston. The initial term of the collective bargaining agreement expires on July 16, 2021 then automatically renews for successive one-year periods unless either party gives a notice of proposed modification or termination at least sixty days prior to the expiration date or a subsequent renewal date. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. 
Environmental 
 As the owner, lessee or operator of various real properties and facilities, we are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Historically, compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance, however, that compliance with existing or new environmental laws and regulations will not require us to make significant expenditures in the future.
