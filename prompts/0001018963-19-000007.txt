Our Business
ATI’s strategic vision is to be an aligned and integrated specialty materials and components company. Our strategies target the products and global growth markets that require and value ATI’s technical and manufacturing capabilities. Our largest markets are aerospace & defense, representing approximately 50% of total sales, led by products for jet engines. Additionally, we have a strong presence in the oil & gas, medical, electrical energy and automotive markets. ATI is a market leader in manufacturing differentiated products that require our unique manufacturing and precision machining capabilities as well as our innovative new product development competence. Our capabilities range from alloy development to final production of highly engineered finished components, as well as producing powders used in next-generation jet engine forgings and 3D-printed aerospace products. 
We operate in two business segments: High Performance Materials & Components (HPMC), and Flat Rolled Products (FRP). Over 75% of 2018 HPMC business segment sales were to the aerospace & defense markets, and nearly half of HPMC’s total sales are products for commercial jet engines. Increasing demand for commercial aerospace products has been the main source of sales and segment operating profit growth for HPMC over the last few years, and is expected to continue to drive HPMC and overall ATI results for the next several years due to the ongoing expansion in production of next generation jet engines and airplanes. Other major HPMC end markets include medical, oil & gas, electrical energy, and construction & mining. HPMC produces a wide range of high performance materials and components, including advanced metallic powder alloys, made from titanium and titanium-based alloys, nickel-based alloys and superalloys, and a variety of other specialty materials. These materials are made in a variety of product forms that include precision forgings, castings, machined parts, 3D-printed parts and others. 
Our FRP segment serves a diverse group of end markets, with the oil & gas market, including chemical and hydrocarbon processing, and the automotive market collectively representing over 45% of 2018 sales. Other major end markets for FRP include aerospace & defense, food equipment and appliances, construction & mining, electronics, communication equipment and computers. FRP produces nickel-based alloys, specialty alloys, and titanium and titanium-based alloys, and stainless steel in a variety of product forms including plate, sheet, engineered strip, and Precision Rolled Strip products. 
 Strategic end use markets for our products include:
Aerospace & Defense. We are a world leader in the production of specialty materials and components for both commercial and military jet engines and airframes supporting customer needs for initial build requirements and for spare parts. Through alloy development, internal growth efforts, and long-term supply agreements on current and next-generation jet engines and airframes, we are well positioned with a fully qualified asset base to meet the expected multi-year demand growth from the commercial aerospace market. 
Typical aerospace applications for nickel-based alloys and superalloys and advanced metallic powders include jet engine shafts, discs, blades, vanes, rings and casings. Nickel-based alloys and superalloys remain extremely strong at high temperatures and resist degradation under extreme conditions. The next generation jet engines use advanced nickel-based superalloys and metallic powder alloys due to increased fuel efficiency requirements that require hotter-burning engines. Our specialty materials are also used in the manufacture of aircraft landing gear and structural components.
We are a global industry leader in isothermal and hot-die forging technologies for advanced aerospace components. Capital investments for our fourth iso-thermal press and heat-treating capacity expansion at our Iso-Thermal Forging Center of Excellence in Cudahy, WI began in 2018 and will continue through 2019. We produce highly sophisticated components that have differing mechanical properties across a single product unit and are highly-resistant to fatigue and temperature effects. Our precision forgings are used for jet engine components, structural components for aircraft, helicopters, launch vehicles, and other demanding applications. ATI provides a full range of post-production inspection and machining with the certified quality needed to meet demanding application requirements.  ATI has the technology, equipment, and know-how to cast titanium parts in some of the largest and most complex sizes and shapes currently being manufactured for aerospace applications, and our

advanced manufacturing capabilities offer OEMs the freedom to design components with intricate geometries, cored passageways, cast-in features, and sculpted surfaces.  
Products and components made from titanium and titanium-based alloys, such as jet engine components including blades, vanes, discs, and casings, and airframe components such as structural members, landing gears, hydraulic systems, and fasteners, are critical in aerospace applications. These materials and components possess an extraordinary combination of properties that help to increase jet engine fuel efficiency and product longevity, including superior strength-to-weight ratio, elevated temperature resistance, low coefficient of thermal expansion, and extreme corrosion resistance. 
Our specialty materials and components for government aerospace and defense applications include naval nuclear products, military jet engines, fixed wing and rotorcraft products, and armor applications. We expect to increase our sales in government defense applications in future years, and in 2017 announced a long-term supply agreement with General Dynamics Land Systems for titanium-based armor plate products for both U.S. and U.K. military ground defense vehicles that utilize a range of ATI’s manufacturing assets involving both the HMPC and FRP segments.
We continuously seek to develop and manufacture innovative new alloys to better serve the needs of the aerospace & defense markets. For example, ATI 718Plus® nickel-based superalloy, Rene 65 near-powder superalloy, and our powder alloys have won significant share in the current and next-generation jet engines. ATI’s metallic powder technology delivers alloy compositions and refined microstructures that offer increased performance and longer useful lives in high-temperature aerospace environments as well as improving the efficiency of jet engines. Our metallic powder products deliver the most uniform grain structure achievable in near-net shapes. We continue to increase our production capacity for advanced metallic powders for use in next-generation aerospace products, including additive manufacturing applications. In 2018, we acquired the assets of Addaero Manufacturing, a leader in metal alloy-based additive manufacturing, to expand ATI’s capabilities to provide comprehensive customer solutions ranging from the design of parts for additive manufacturing to the production of ready-to-install components. Our nickel-based powder alloy expansion in North Carolina was completed in 2017 and achieved initial commercial qualifications in early 2018. In 2018, capital investments were made for a titanium powder expansion located on the same site.
Oil & Gas. The environments in which oil & gas can be found in commercial quantities have become more challenging, involving deep offshore wells, high pressure and high temperature conditions in sour wells and unconventional sources, such as shale oil & gas, and oil sands. These challenging offshore environments are located further off the continental shelf, including locations in arctic and tropical waters more difficult than previously-sourced locations. They are often more than one mile below the water’s surface, and up to two miles below the ocean floor. We enable our customer’s success in these applications by developing and producing specialty materials for equipment that can operate for up to 30 years in these harsh environments.
Both of our business segments produce specialty materials that are critical to the oil & gas industry. Our specialty materials, including nickel-based alloys, stainless and duplex alloys, and other specialty alloys, have the strength and corrosion-resistant properties necessary to meet these challenging operating conditions. Several of our strip, plate and cast products meet NORSOK qualification standards, which are developed by the Norwegian petroleum industry and are intended to identify materials used in oil and gas applications that are safe and cost-effective.
Electrical Energy. Our specialty materials are widely used in the global electrical power generation and distribution industries. We believe energy needs and environmental policies and the electrification of developing countries will continue to drive demand for our specialty materials and products for use in this industry over the long term.
For electrical power generation, our specialty materials, including corrosion-resistant alloys (CRAs), are used in coal, nuclear, and natural gas applications. In coal-fired plants, our CRAs are used for pipe, tube, and heat exchanger applications in water systems in addition to pollution control scrubbers. Our CRAs are also used in water systems, fuel cladding components, and process equipment for nuclear power plants. For nuclear power plants, we are an industry pioneer in producing nuclear reactor fuel cladding and structural components utilizing zirconium and hafnium alloys. We are a technology leader for large diameter components used in natural gas land-based turbines for power generation. For alternative energy generation, our alloys are used for solar, fuel cell and geothermal applications.
Medical. ATI’s advanced specialty materials are used in medical device products that enhance the quality of people’s lives around the world.
Our specialty alloys are used for replacement knees, hips and other prosthetic devices. The use of our alloys in these replacement devices offer the potential of longer product lifespans versus previous implant generations.
Our biocompatible nickel-titanium shape memory alloy is used for stents to support collapsed or clogged blood vessels. Reduced in diameter for insertion, these stents expand post-implant to the original tube-like shape due to the metal’s 
 4

superelasticity. In addition, our ultra fine diameter (0.002 inch/0.051 mm) titanium wire is used for screens to prevent blood clots from entering critical areas of the body. 
Manufacturers of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices rely on our niobium superconducting wire to help produce electromagnetic fields that allow physicians to safely scan the body’s soft tissue. We recently announced that we entered into a joint technology development agreement with Bruker Energy & Supercon Technologies, to advance state-of-the-art niobium-based superconductors, including those used in MRI magnets for the medical industry, and preclinical MRI magnets used in the life-science tools industry.
Automotive. For automobiles, ATI specialty materials are used for powertrain and structural parts, exhaust systems and emission control parts, gaskets, air bag inflator housings, windshield wipers and blades, fuel systems, fasteners, hose clamps, gaskets and other components. Stainless steel is also used on exterior trim for its bright appearance and for internal components for its corrosion resistance.
ATI’s advanced nickel-based alloys and specialty alloys in flat-rolled products are used primarily in engine and exhaust applications for the automotive market.  We expect global demand to grow for our high-value precision and engineered strip for automotive applications such as gaskets, hose clamps, and turbo chargers.  Our Hot-Rolling and Processing Facility (HRPF) provides the capability to produce high-value alloys in wider and longer product forms. As automotive engine operating temperatures rise due to the increasing use of turbochargers to improve fuel efficiency, we believe our expertise in heat-resistant aerospace alloys will enable us to expand our share of this market, improving our high-value product mix.  
Business Segments
Our two business segments accounted for the following percentages of total revenues of $4.05 billion, $3.53 billion, and $3.13 billion for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. 

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
High Performance Materials & Components | 58 | % | | 59 | % | 62 | %
Flat Rolled Products | 42 | % | | 41 | % | 38 | %

Information with respect to our business segments is presented below and in Note 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
High Performance Materials & Components Segment
Our HPMC segment produces a wide range of high performance specialty materials, parts and components for several major end markets, including aerospace & defense, medical, electrical energy, and oil & gas. 76% of the HPMC segment’s 2018 revenues were derived from the aerospace & defense markets. Demand for our products is driven primarily by the commercial aerospace cycle. Large aircraft and jet engines are manufactured by a small number of companies, such as The Boeing Company, Airbus S.A.S. (an Airbus Group company) including the former operations of Bombardier Aerospace, and Embraer (Empresa Brasileira de Aeronáutica S.A.) for airframes, and GE Aviation (a division of General Electric Company), Rolls-Royce plc, Pratt & Whitney (a division of United Technologies Corporation), Snecma (SAFRAN Group), and various joint ventures that manufacture jet engines. These companies, and their suppliers, form a substantial part of our customer base in this business segment. The loss of one or more of our customers in the aerospace & defense markets could have a material adverse effect on ATI’s results of operations and financial condition. 
Our products are manufactured from a wide range of advanced materials including metallic powder alloys, made from titanium and titanium-based alloys, nickel-based alloys and superalloys, and a variety of other specialty materials. These materials are made into a variety of product forms that include precision forgings, castings, machined parts and others. We are integrated across these alloy systems in melt, forging, finishing, investment casting, and machining processes. Most of the products in this segment are sold directly to end-use customers, and a significant portion of our HPMC segment products are sold under multi-year agreements.
Principal competitors in the HPMC segment include: Berkshire Hathaway Inc., for nickel-based alloys and superalloys and specialty steel alloys, titanium and titanium-based alloys, precision forgings and investment castings through its ownership of Precision Castparts Corporation and subsidiaries; Arconic Inc., for titanium and titanium-based alloys and precision forgings through its ownership of RTI International Metals, Inc. and Firth Rixson; Carpenter Technology Corporation for nickel-based alloys and superalloys and specialty steel alloys; VSMPO-AVISMA for titanium and titanium-based alloys; and Aubert & Duval for precision forgings.

Flat Rolled Products Segment
Our FRP segment produces nickel-based alloys, specialty alloys, titanium and titanium-based alloys, and stainless steel in a variety of product forms including plate, sheet, engineered strip, and Precision Rolled Strip® products. The major end markets for our flat-rolled products are oil & gas, automotive, aerospace & defense, food processing equipment and appliances, construction & mining, electronics, communication equipment and computers. The operations in this segment include ATI Flat Rolled Products and the Chinese joint venture company known as Shanghai STAL Precision Stainless Steel Company Limited (STAL), in which we hold a 60% interest. Segment results also include our 50% interest in the industrial titanium joint venture known as Uniti LLC and our 50% interest in Allegheny & Tsingshan Stainless (A&T Stainless). 
Nickel-based alloys, titanium, and stainless steel sheet products are used in a wide variety of industrial and consumer applications. In 2018, approximately 75% of our stainless sheet products by volume were sold to independent service centers, which have slitting, cutting or other processing facilities, with the remainder sold directly to end-use customers.
Engineered strip and Precision Rolled Strip products, which are under 0.015 inches thick, are used by customers to fabricate a variety of products primarily in the automotive, construction, and electronics markets. In 2018, approximately 90% of these products by volume were sold directly to end-use customers or through our own distribution network, with the remainder sold to independent service centers. In 2018, we completed the construction of our third Precision Rolled Strip manufacturing facility at our STAL joint venture in China.
Nickel-based alloy, titanium, and stainless steel plate products are primarily used in aerospace, defense, and corrosion and industrial markets. In 2018, approximately 60% of our plate products by volume were sold to independent service centers, with the remainder sold directly to end-use customers.
Competition in the Flat Rolled Products segment includes domestic stainless steel competitors North American Stainless, Outokumpu Stainless USA, LLC, and AK Steel Corporation, as well as imports from numerous foreign producers, including Aperam, based in Europe. Competitors for nickel-based alloys and superalloys and specialty steel alloys include Haynes International and VDM Metals GmbH. 
In 2018, we took important steps toward improving the capacity utilization of our HRPF, most notably with the A&T Stainless joint venture to manufacture 60” wide stainless sheet, as well as the agreement for carbon steel hot-rolling conversion services with NLMK USA, which is expected to ramp up throughout 2019. In late March 2018, ATI filed for an exclusion from the recently enacted Section 232 tariffs on behalf of the A&T Stainless joint venture. In the absence of an exclusion, these slabs are subject to the 25% tariff levied on all stainless steel products imported into the United States. We continue to work within the U.S. Commerce Department’s Section 232 tariff exclusion request process to secure an exclusion on behalf of the A&T Stainless joint venture. 
Significant global overcapacity for stainless steel flat-rolled products has intensified the price competition in this segment over the last several years. Some of our foreign competitors are either directly or indirectly subsidized by governments. In 1999, the United States imposed anti-dumping and countervailing duties on unfairly low-priced and subsidized imports of stainless steel sheet and strip in coils and stainless steel plate in coils from companies in ten foreign countries. The anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders were reviewed in 2011 by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission to determine whether the orders should remain in place for another five years.  The agencies decided that eight such orders against five countries would continue in effect. In July 2016, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission initiated a third review of the eight orders. The four orders covering imports of stainless steel plate in coils from three countries were continued for an additional five years in December 2016. In October 2017, the U.S. Department of Commerce published a notice continuing for an additional five years for orders covering imports of stainless steel sheet and strip in coils from three countries.
Additionally, in February 2016, ATI and the three domestic stainless steel competitors filed antidumping and countervailing duty petitions concurrently with the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S International Trade Commission, charging that unfairly traded imports of stainless steel sheet and strip from the People’s Republic of China are causing material injury to the domestic stainless steel industry. In February 2017, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued its final determinations, calculating antidumping duties ranging from 64% and 77% percent and countervailing duties ranging from 76% and 191%. These duties are generally applied in combination. The U.S. International Trade Commission reached a unanimous affirmative determination in early March 2017. The antidumping duties and subsidy margins, which have remained unchanged since the Commerce Department published the unfair trade orders in April 2017, are expected to act as a significant deterrent to the illegal dumping of Chinese government-subsidized imports of stainless steel sheet and strip into the U.S. market. We continue to monitor imports from foreign producers for appropriate action.

Raw Materials and Supplies
Substantially all raw materials and supplies required in the manufacture of our products are available from more than one supplier, and the sources and availability of raw materials essential to our businesses are currently adequate. The principal raw materials we use in the production of our specialty materials are scrap (including iron-, nickel-, chromium-, titanium-, and molybdenum-bearing scrap), nickel, titanium sponge, zirconium sand and sponge, ferrochromium, ferrosilicon, molybdenum and molybdenum alloys, manganese and manganese alloys, cobalt, niobium, vanadium and other alloying materials. While we enter into raw materials futures contracts from time-to-time to hedge exposure to price fluctuations, such as for nickel, we cannot be certain that our hedge position adequately reduces exposure. We believe that we have adequate controls to monitor these contracts, but we may not be able to accurately assess exposure to price volatility in the markets for critical raw materials.
In 2016, we indefinitely idled our Rowley, UT titanium sponge production facility. Over the last several years, significant global capacity has been added to produce titanium sponge, which is a key raw material used to produce ATI’s titanium products. As a result, titanium sponge, including aerospace quality sponge, can be purchased from qualified global producers under long-term supply agreements at prices below ATI’s production costs at its Rowley, UT facility. ATI has entered into long-term cost competitive supply agreements with several producers of premium-grade and standard-grade titanium sponge. The lower cost titanium sponge purchased under these supply agreements replaces the titanium sponge produced at the Rowley facility. 
Other raw materials, such as nickel, cobalt, and ferrochromium, are available to us and our specialty materials industry competitors primarily from foreign sources. Some of these foreign sources are located in countries that may be subject to unstable political and economic conditions, which could disrupt supplies or affect the price of these materials.
We purchase our nickel requirements principally from producers in Australia, Canada, Norway, Russia, and the Dominican Republic. Zirconium raw materials are primarily purchased from the United States and China. Cobalt is purchased primarily from producers in Canada. More than 80% of the world’s reserves of ferrochromium are located in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Albania, and Kazakhstan. Niobium is purchased principally from producers in Brazil, and our titanium sponge comes from sources in Japan and Kazakhstan.
Certain key supplies used in melting and other processing operations, such as graphite electrodes and industrial gases including helium and argon, are from time-to-time limited in availability and may be subject to significant price inflation. We enter into long-term supply contracts where possible to ensure an adequate supply of these items, however overall industry shortages may impact our operations and scheduling.
Export Sales and Foreign Operations
International sales represented approximately 42% of our total annual sales in 2018 and 2016, and 41% of our total sales in 2017. These figures include direct export sales by our U.S.-based operations to customers in foreign countries, which accounted for approximately 32% of our total sales in 2018, and 31% of our total sales in 2017 and 2016. Our overseas sales, marketing and distribution efforts are aided by our international marketing and distribution offices, ATI Europe, ATI Europe Distribution, and ATI Asia, or by independent representatives at various locations throughout the world. We believe that at least 50% of ATI’s 2018 sales were driven by global markets when we consider exports of our customers. 
Our HPMC segment has manufacturing capabilities for melting, remelting, forging and finishing nickel-based alloys and specialty alloys in the United Kingdom, and manufacturing capabilities for precision forging and machining in Poland, primarily serving the aerospace, construction & mining and transportation markets. Within our FRP segment, our STAL joint venture in the People’s Republic of China produces Precision Rolled Strip products, which enables us to offer these products more effectively to markets in China and other Asian countries. Our Uniti LLC joint venture allows us to offer titanium products to global industrial markets more effectively.
Backlog, Seasonality and Cyclicality
Our backlog of confirmed orders was approximately $2.2 billion at December 31, 2018 and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2017. We expect that approximately 85% of confirmed orders on hand at December 31, 2018 will be filled during the year ending December 31, 2019. Our HPMC’s segment backlog of confirmed orders was approximately $2.0 billion at December 31, 2018 and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2017. We expect that approximately 85% of the confirmed orders on hand at December 31, 2018 for this segment will be filled during the year ending December 31, 2019. Our FRP’s segment backlog of confirmed orders was approximately $0.2 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. We expect that all of the confirmed orders on hand at December 31, 2018 for this segment will be filled during the year ending December 31, 2019.
 7

Demand for our products is cyclical over longer periods because specialty materials customers operate in cyclical industries and are subject to changes in general economic conditions and other factors both external and internal to those industries. The HPMC segment typically experiences modest seasonal weakness in the third quarter of each fiscal year due to many European customers, particularly in the aerospace supply chain, taking plant outages during this summer period. ATI also typically performs corresponding annual preventative maintenance outages at several facilities during this same period.
Research, Development and Technical Services
We believe that our research and development capabilities give ATI an advantage in developing new products and manufacturing processes that contribute to the long-term profitable growth potential of our businesses. We conduct research and development at our various operating locations both for our own account and, on a limited basis, for customers on a contract basis. Research and development expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 included the following:

(In millions) | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Company-Funded: | | | | | 
High Performance Materials & Components | $ | 17.6 | | | $ | 9.3 | | $ | 10.9
Flat Rolled Products | 2.6 | | | 2.7 | | | 3.6 
Corporate | 2.5 | | | 1.3 | | | 0.2 
 | 22.7 | | | 13.3 | | | 14.7
Customer-Funded: | | | | | 
High Performance Materials & Components | 2.2 | | | 1.4 | | | 2.2 
Total Research and Development | $ | 24.9 | | | $ | 14.7 | | $ | 16.9

Our research, development and technical service activities are closely interrelated and are directed toward development of new products, improvement of existing products, cost reduction, process improvement and control, quality assurance and control, development of new manufacturing methods, and improvement of existing manufacturing methods. The increased activity in 2018 was largely related to materials and manufacturing methods for products supporting the aerospace & defense markets.
We own hundreds of United States patents, many of which are also filed under the patent laws of other nations. Although these patents, as well as our numerous trademarks, technical information, license agreements, and other intellectual property, have been and are expected to be of value, we believe that the loss of any single such item or technically related group of such items would not materially affect the conduct of our business.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
We are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants and disposal of wastes, and which may require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations. We could incur substantial cleanup costs, fines, civil or criminal sanctions, third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations or liabilities under these laws or non-compliance with environmental permits required at our facilities. We are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of our current and former sites as well as third party sites.
We consider environmental compliance to be an integral part of our operations. We have a comprehensive environmental management and reporting program that focuses on compliance with applicable federal, state, regional and local environmental laws and regulations. Each operating company has an environmental management system that includes mechanisms for regularly evaluating environmental compliance and managing changes in business operations while assessing environmental impact.
Our Corporate Guidelines for Business Conduct and Ethics address compliance with environmental laws as well as employment and workplace safety laws, and also describe our commitment to equal opportunity and fair treatment of employees. We continued to focus on safety across ATI’s operations during 2018. 
Employees
We have approximately 8,800 full-time employees, of which approximately 15% are located outside the United States. Approximately 40% of our workforce is covered by various collective bargaining agreements (CBAs), predominantly with the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied & Industrial Service Workers International Union, AFL-CIO, CLC (USW). New CBAs were ratified in 2018 with approximately 900 USW-represented employees, and there are 
 8

no expired CBAs as of the end of 2018. Our next significant CBA expiration date is in the first quarter of 2020 involving USW-represented employees located primarily within the FRP segment operations and at two facilities in the HPMC segment.
