Item 1.  Business.
Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "we," "us" and "our" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refer to Best Buy Co., Inc. and, as applicable, its consolidated subsidiaries. Any references to our website addresses do not constitute incorporation by reference of the information contained on the websites.
Description of Business
We were incorporated in the state of Minnesota in 1966. We strive to enrich the lives of consumers through technology, whether they connect with us online, visit our stores or invite us into their homes. We do this by solving technology problems and addressing key human needs across a range of areas, including entertainment, productivity, communication, food preparation, security and health and wellness. We have operations in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. 
Segments and Geographic Areas
We have two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of the operations in all states, districts and territories of the U.S. under various brand names including Best Buy, bestbuy.com, Best Buy Direct, Best Buy Express, Best Buy Mobile, Geek Squad, GreatCall, Magnolia and Pacific Kitchen and Home. The International segment is comprised of all operations in Canada and Mexico under the brand names Best Buy, Best Buy Express, Best Buy Mobile, Geek Squad and the domain names bestbuy.ca and bestbuy.com.mx.
On March 1, 2018, we announced our intent to close all of our 257 remaining Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in the U.S., and all remaining stores were closed during the second quarter of fiscal 2019. On October 1, 2018, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of GreatCall, Inc. ("GreatCall"), a leading connected health services provider for aging consumers that offers easy-to-use mobile products and connected devices. Additional information on these changes is included in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 2, Acquisition, and Note 9, Restructuring Charges, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Operations
Our Domestic and International segments are managed by leadership teams responsible for all areas of the business. Both segments operate a multi-channel platform that allows customers to connect with us online, visit our stores or invite us into their homes.
Domestic Segment
Development of merchandise and services offerings, pricing and promotions, procurement and supply chain, online and mobile application operations, marketing and advertising and labor deployment across all channels are centrally managed. In addition, support capabilities (for example, human resources, finance and real estate management) are generally performed at our corporate headquarters. We also have field operations that support retail, services and in-home teams from our corporate headquarters and regional locations. Our retail stores have procedures for inventory management, asset protection, transaction processing, customer relations, store administration, product sales and services, staff training and merchandise display that are largely standardized. All stores generally operate under standard procedures with a degree of flexibility for store management to address certain local market characteristics. 
International Segment
Our Canada and Mexico operations are similar to those in our Domestic segment.
Merchandise and Services
Our Domestic and International segments have offerings in six revenue categories: Computing and Mobile Phones, Consumer Electronics, Appliances, Entertainment, Services and Other. These categories provide products and services to our customers that address key human needs across a range of areas, including entertainment, productivity, communication, food preparation, security and health and wellness. The key components of each revenue category are as follows:
4


• | Computing and Mobile Phones - computing and peripherals, e-readers, mobile phones (including related mobile network carrier commissions), networking, tablets and wearables (including smartwatches);


• | Consumer Electronics - digital imaging, health and fitness, home theater, portable audio (including headphones and portable speakers) and smart home;


• | Appliances - major appliances (including dishwashers, laundry, ovens and refrigerators) and small appliances (including blenders, coffee makers and vacuums);


• | Entertainment - drones, gaming hardware and software, movies, music, toys, virtual reality and other software;


• | Services - consultation, delivery, design, installation, memberships, protection plans, repair, set-up, technical support and GreatCall offerings; and


• | Other - beverages, snacks, sundry items and other product offerings within our International segment (including baby, luggage and sporting goods).

Distribution
Domestic Segment
Customers who purchase products online have the choice to pick up product at U.S. Best Buy stores or have it delivered directly to them from a distribution center or retail store. Our ship-from-store capability allows us to improve product availability and delivery times for customers. Most merchandise is shipped directly from manufacturers to our distribution centers located throughout the U.S. In order to meet release dates for certain products, merchandise may be shipped directly to our stores from suppliers.
International Segment
Our Canada and Mexico distribution model is similar to that of our Domestic segment.
Suppliers and Inventory
Our Domestic and International segments purchase merchandise from a variety of suppliers. In fiscal 2019, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 64% of the merchandise we purchased, with five suppliers – Apple, Samsung, Hewlett-Packard, Sony and LG – representing approximately 51% of total merchandise purchased. We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise or that secure any of the key terms of our arrangements.
We carefully monitor and manage our inventory levels in an effort to match quantities on hand with consumer demand as closely as possible. Key elements to our inventory management process include the following: continuous monitoring of historical and projected consumer demand, continuous monitoring and adjustment of inventory receipt levels and pricing, agreements with vendors relating to reimbursement for the cost of markdowns or sales incentives and agreements with vendors relating to return privileges for certain products.
We also have a global sourcing operation to design, develop, test and contract-manufacture our exclusive brand products.
Store Development
We had 1,187 large-format and 51 small-format stores at the end of fiscal 2019 throughout our Domestic and International segments. Our stores are a vital component of our multi-channel strategy and we believe they are an important competitive advantage. We have the ability to ship from all of our Best Buy stores in the U.S. and all of our large-format stores in Canada. Customers may also elect to pick up orders initiated online in any of our stores. Beginning in 2013, we opened vendor store-within-a-store concepts to allow closer vendor partnerships and a higher quality customer experience. In fiscal 2020 and beyond, we will continue to look for opportunities to optimize our store space, renegotiate leases and selectively open or close locations to support our operations.
Refer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for tables reconciling our Domestic and International segment stores open at the end of each of the last three fiscal years.

Intellectual Property
We own or have the right to use valuable intellectual property such as trademarks, service marks and tradenames, including, but not limited to, Best Buy, Best Buy Express, Best Buy Mobile, Dynex, Geek Squad, GreatCall, Insignia, Jitterbug, Lively, Magnolia, Modal, My Best Buy, Pacific Sales, Pacific Kitchen and Home, Platinum, Rocketfish, 5Star and our Yellow Tag logo.
We have secured domestic and international trademark and service mark registrations for many of our brands. We have also secured patents for many of our inventions. We believe our intellectual property has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our company, our stores, our products and our websites.
Seasonality
Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.
Working Capital
We fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows generated from operations. In addition, our revolving credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs, for general corporate purposes and investment and growth opportunities. Our working capital needs typically increase in the months leading up to the holiday shopping season as we purchase inventory in advance of expected sales. 
Competition
Our competitors are primarily multi-channel retailers, e-commerce businesses, technology service providers, traditional store-based retailers, vendors and mobile network carriers who offer their products and services directly to customers. We believe our ability to help customers online, in stores and in their homes and to connect technology product and solutions with customer needs offers us key competitive advantages. Some of our competitors have lower cost operating structures and seek to compete for sales primarily on price. In the U.S., online-only retailers historically were not generally required to collect sales taxes in certain states. However, a June 2018 Supreme Court decision (South Dakota v. Wayfair) authorized states to require online-only retailers to collect and remit sales taxes. As a result, the online-only sales tax advantage of some of our competitors will continue to erode as more states require online-only retailers to collect sales tax. We carefully monitor pricing offered by other retailers, as maintaining price competitiveness is one of our ongoing priorities. In addition, we have price-matching policies that allow customers to request that we match a price offered by certain retail stores and online operators. In order to allow this, we are focused on maintaining efficient operations and leveraging the economies of scale available to us through our global vendor partnerships. We believe our dedicated and knowledgeable people, our integrated online, retail and in-home assets, our broad and curated product assortment, our strong vendor partnerships, our service and support offerings designed to solve real customer needs, our unique ability to showcase technology in distinct store formats and our supply chain are important ways in which we maintain our competitive advantage.
Environmental and Social Matters
We are an organization built upon values-driven leadership and focused on our purpose to enrich lives through technology. We seek to apply our sense of corporate responsibility and focus on sustainable development to our interactions with all our stakeholders, including our customers, our employees, our vendor partners, our stockholders, the community in which we operate and the environment. Examples of such activities include the following. 
For employees, we expanded our benefits to include enhanced mental health coverage, backup childcare, caregiver leave and paid time off for part-time employees. We reinforced our commitment to diversity and inclusion by signing the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion Pledge and the Parity Pledge.
We are committed to supporting teens from underserved communities by building brighter futures through technology training and mentorship. The primary way we do this is through our network of Best Buy Teen Tech Centers, which help prepare teens for careers in tech by providing them with opportunities to engage with the latest technology, learn core professional skills and connect with Best Buy employee mentors. We currently have 25 Teen Tech Centers and plan to reach 60 in total over the next few years.
We continuously look for solutions that minimize carbon emissions in our operations and have achieved a significant carbon reduction toward our goal of 60 percent by 2020 (over a 2009 baseline), from both operational reductions and renewable sourcing. We also help our customers live more sustainably by assorting ENERGY STAR® certified products, which help them

save money on utility bills. In addition, we collected more than 180 million pounds of consumer electronics and appliances for recycling in fiscal 2019.

Number of Employees
At the end of fiscal 2019, we employed nearly 125,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal employees in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. We offer our employees a wide array of company-paid benefits that vary within our company due to customary local practices and statutory requirements, which we believe are competitive locally and in the aggregate relative to others in our industry.
