  ITEM 1 AND 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES.
  
  History
  
 We were originally incorporated in September 2000 as Rocker & Spike Entertainment, Inc. In January 2001 we changed our name to Reconstruction Data Group, Inc., and in April 2003 we changed our name to Verdisys, Inc. and were engaged in the business of providing satellite services to agribusiness. In June 2005, we changed our name to Blast Energy Services, Inc. (“Blast”) to reflect our new focus on the energy services business, and in 2010 we changed the direction of the Company to focus on the acquisition of oil and gas producing properties.
  
 On July 27, 2012, we acquired, through a reverse acquisition, Pacific Energy Development Corp., a privately held Nevada corporation, which we refer to as Pacific Energy Development. As described below, pursuant to the acquisition, the shareholders of Pacific Energy Development gained control of approximately 95% of the voting securities of our company. Since the transaction resulted in a change of control, Pacific Energy Development was the acquirer for accounting purposes. In connection with the merger, which we refer to as the Pacific Energy Development merger, Pacific Energy Development became our wholly-owned subsidiary and we changed our name from Blast Energy Services, Inc. to PEDEVCO Corp. Following the merger, we refocused our business plan on the acquisition, exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas resources in the United States.
  
  Office Leases
  
 Our corporate headquarters is located in approximately 4,600 square feet of office space at 1250 Wood Branch Park Dr., Suite 400, Houston, Texas 77079. We lease that space pursuant to a lease that expires in August 2019 and the company is currently in negotiations to extend its lease or move to new office space to accommodate growth. The Company previously had additional office space at our former corporate headquarters in Danville, California, which lease was terminated in February 2019 without penalty or other amounts due.
 Business Operations
  
  Overview
  
 We are an oil and gas company focused on the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas assets where the latest in modern drilling and completion techniques and technologies have yet to be applied. In particular, we focus on legacy proven properties where there is a long production history, well defined geology and existing infrastructure that can be leveraged when applying modern field management technologies. Our current properties are located in the San Andres formation of the Permian Basin situated in West Texas and eastern New Mexico (the “Permian Basin”) and in the Denver-Julesberg Basin (“D-J Basin”) in Colorado.   As of December 31, 2018, we held approximately 23,441 net Permian Basin acres located in Chaves and Roosevelt Counties, New Mexico, through our wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Pacific Energy Development Corp. (“PEDCO”), which we refer to as our “Permian Basin Asset,” and approximately 11,948 net D-J Basin acres located in Weld and Morgan Counties, Colorado, through our wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Red Hawk Petroleum, LLC (“Red Hawk”), which asset we refer to as our “D-J Basin Asset.” As of December 31, 2018, we held interests in 337 gross (337 net) wells in our Permian Basin Asset of which 51 are active producers, 18 are active injectors and one well is an active Saltwater Disposal Well (“SWD”), all of which are held by PEDCO and operated by its wholly-owned operating subsidiaries, and interests in 69 gross (21.5 net) wells in our D-J Basin Asset, of which 18 gross (16.2 net) wells are operated by Red Hawk and currently producing, 29 gross (5.2 net) wells are non-operated, and 22 wells have an after-payout interest.
 Restructuring
 
   ●
 Prior to June 2018, the Company focused primarily on development of the unconventional shale formations within the D-J Basin. The Company organically developed and aggregated oil and gas properties through the energy industry downturn in 2016, in the process accumulating $73.4 million in debt as of June 25, 2018.

   ●
 On June 26, 2018, the Company secured a strategic investment from SK Energy LLC (“SK Energy”), which is owned and controlled by Dr. Simon Kukes, who subsequently became the Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company on July 12, 2018, amounting to a $7.7 million note investment which proceeds, and related transactions, resulted in the elimination of $78.3 million of outstanding liabilities, and which transactions also included the $100,000 acquisition by SK Energy, from a third party, of all the outstanding shares of the Company’s then-outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (66,625 shares convertible into 47.6% of the Company’s outstanding shares post-conversion(collectively referred to as the “Restructuring”). At the time of the Restructuring, the Company owned 9,607 net acres located within the Wattenberg Core and Wattenberg Extension of the D-J Basin.

   ●
 The result of the Restructuring was a simplified balance sheet, a significant reduction in indebtedness, and a new management team with a new corporate and enhanced operational focus.

  Transformation
 
 Simultaneously with the Restructuring, the newly installed management team was in the process of evaluating several acquisitions that contemplated a shift in the Company’s overall business strategy to focus on assets with the following characteristics:
  
   o
 Long-lived, conventional oil and gas properties

   o
 Tighter conventional reservoirs with historical underdeveloped vertical recovery, ideal for horizontal development

   o
 Permeability and rock properties significantly better than shale plays

   o
 Minimal to no application of modern drilling and completion techniques and technologies

   o
 Existing equipment, facilities and available access to infrastructure

   o
 Large contiguous acreage positions

 
 Consistent with the Company’s new business strategy, the Company consummated the following transactions in August 2018:
  
  Acquisition of Permian Basin Properties
  
 On August 31, 2018, the Company closed the acquisition of the Permian Basin Asset in New Mexico, from Hunter Oil Company for a purchase price of $21.3 million. The purchase price included $18.5 million for all production, associated assets and acreage, $500,000 for the operating entities and associated inventory, and $2.3 million of restricted cash held in the operating companies for bonding with the State of New Mexico. These properties had previously been evaluated by the new management team and fit the new corporate focus. Both the Milnesand and Chaveroo fields in the Permian Basin Asset are legacy oil fields having produced to date 48 million barrels of oil equivalent from the San Andres formation, via 40-acre vertical well spacing. The Company believes that by applying horizontal drilling and modern completion techniques to the Permian Basin Asset, downspacing to 20 acres can be achieved at a lower cost, with significantly better recoveries than continued vertical drilling.
  
 To finance this acquisition, the Company sold $23.6 million of convertible debt with a conversion price of $2.13 per share. SK Energy purchased $22.0 million of the convertible debt, which SK Energy subsequently converted into common stock effective March 1, 2019, as discussed below under “Recent Events” – “SK Energy Note Amendment; Note Purchases and Conversion”.
 
  Acquisition of Additional D-J Basin Properties
 
 In August 2018 the Company also acquired additional assets consisting of four operated wells and 2,340 net acres held by production in the D-J Basin which added to the Company’s then-current position. This consolidation of ownership in existing acreage within the D-J Basin provides for a more focused development plan related to these assets.
 Business Strategy
  
 We believe that horizontal development and exploitation of conventional assets in the Permian Basin and development of the Wattenberg and Wattenberg Extension in the D-J Basin, represent among the most economic oil and natural gas plays in the U.S. We plan to optimize our existing assets and opportunistically seek additional acreage proximate to our currently held core acreage, as well as other attractive onshore U.S. oil and gas assets that fit our acquisition criteria, that Company management believes can be developed using our technical and operating expertise and be accretive to shareholder value. 
    
   
9


  
  
 Specifically, we seek to increase shareholder value through the following strategies:
 
   ●
 Grow production, cash flow and reserves by developing our operated drilling inventory and participating opportunistically in non-operated projects. We believe our extensive inventory of drilling locations in the Permian Basin and the DJ-Basin, combined with our operating expertise, will enable us to continue to deliver accretive production, cash flow and reserves growth. We have identified approximately 150 gross drilling locations across our Permian Basin acreage based on 20-acre spacing. We believe the location, concentration and scale of our core leasehold positions, coupled with our technical understanding of the reservoirs will allow us to efficiently develop our core areas and to allocate capital to maximize the value of our resource base.

   ●
 Apply modern drilling and completion techniques and technologies. We own and intend to own additional properties that have been historically underdeveloped and underexploited. We believe our attention to detail and application of the latest industry advances in horizontal drilling, completions design, frac intensity and locally optimal frac fluids will allow us to successfully develop our properties.

   ●
 Optimization of well density and configuration. We own properties that are legacy conventional oil fields characterized by widespread vertical development and geological well control. We utilize the extensive petrophysical and production data of such legacy properties to confirm optimal well spacing and configuration using modern reservoir evaluation methodologies.

   ●
 Maintain a high degree of operational control. We believe that by retaining high operational control, we can efficiently manage the timing and amount of our capital expenditures and operating costs, and thus key in on the optimal drilling and completions strategies, which we believe will generate higher recoveries and greater rates of return per well.

   ●
 Leverage extensive deal flow, technical and operational experience to evaluate and execute accretive acquisition opportunities. Our management and technical teams have an extensive track record of forming and building oil and gas businesses. We also have significant expertise in successfully sourcing, evaluating and executing acquisition opportunities. We believe our understanding of the geology, geophysics and reservoir properties of potential acquisition targets will allow us to identify and acquire highly prospective acreage in order to grow our reserve base and maximize stockholder value.

   ●
 Preserve financial flexibility to pursue organic and external growth opportunities. We intend to maintain a disciplined financial profile that will provide us flexibility across various commodity and market cycles. We intend to utilize our strategic partners and public currency to continuously fund development and operations.

 
 Our strategy is to be the operator, directly or through our subsidiaries and joint ventures, in the majority of our acreage so we can dictate the pace of development in order to execute our business plan. The majority of our capital expenditure budget through 2019 will be focused on the development of our Permian Basin Asset, with a secondary focus on development of our D-J Basin Asset. Our 2019 total development plan calls for the deployment of an estimated $52 million in capital, of which approximately $22 million has been raised to date. On our Permian Basin Asset four initial horizontal wells were drilled in December 2018 and January 2019 in phase one of our development plan, followed by phase two which contemplates the drilling and completion of an additional eight horizontal wells through 2020, subject to, and based upon, the results from phase one, and in each case, available funding. Our 2019 D-J Basin Asset development plan is currently under evaluation for our operated acreage and our non-operated acreage and is projected to require approximately $7.6 million in capital through 2019. Due to the held-by-production nature of our Permian Basin assets, we believe capital can be readily allocated to our D-J Basin assets if needed. We expect that we will have sufficient cash available to meet our needs over the foreseeable future, which cash we anticipate being available from (i) our projected cash flow from operations, (ii) our existing cash on hand, (iii) equity infusions or loans (which may be convertible) made available from our largest shareholder, SK Energy, which is owned and controlled by Dr. Simon Kukes, our Chief Executive Officer and director, which funding SK Energy is under no obligation to provide and which funds may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, we may seek additional funding through asset sales, farm-out arrangements, lines of credit, or public or private debt or equity financings to fund additional 2019 capital expenditures and/or acquisitions. If market conditions are not conducive to raising additional funds, the Company may choose to extend the drilling program and associated capital expenditures further into 2020.

Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.”
  
  Competition
  
 The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We compete, and will continue to compete, with major and independent oil and natural gas companies for exploration and exploitation opportunities, acreage and property acquisitions. We also compete for drilling rig contracts and other equipment and labor required to drill, operate and develop our properties. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources, staffs, facilities and other resources than we have. In addition, larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. These competitors may be able to pay more for drilling rigs or exploratory prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than we can. Our competitors may also be able to afford to purchase and operate their own drilling rigs.
  
   
11


  
 
 Our ability to exploit, drill and explore for oil and natural gas and to acquire properties will depend upon our ability to conduct operations, to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment. Many of our competitors have a longer history of operations than we have, and many of them have also demonstrated the ability to operate through industry cycles.
  
  Competitive Strengths
  
 We believe we are well positioned to successfully execute our business strategies and achieve our business objectives because of the following competitive strengths:
  
 Legacy Conventional Focus. Legacy conventional oil fields that have seen large-scale vertical development. Vertical production confirms moveable hydrocarbons ideal for horizontal development that may have been technologically or economically limited or missed.
  
 Technical Engineering & Operations Expertise. Lateral landing decisions incorporate log analysis, fracture-geometry modeling and an understanding of local porosity and saturation distributions. Our team are creative problem solvers with expertise in wellbore mechanics, completion design, production enhancement, artificial lift design, water handling, facilities optimization, and production down-time reduction.
  
 Low Cost Development. Shallow conventional reservoirs (<8,000 feet) and short to mid-range laterals (1.0 mile and 1.5 mile, respectively) allow for efficient full-scale development without the requirement for extended reach laterals and large fracs to meet economic thresholds.
  
 Management. We have assembled a management team at our Company with extensive experience in the fields of business development, petroleum engineering, geology, field development and production, operations, planning and corporate finance. Our management team is headed by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Simon Kukes, who was formerly the CEO at Samara-Nafta, a Russian oil company partnering with Hess Corporation, President and CEO of Tyumen Oil Company, and Chairman of Yukos Oil. Our President, J. Douglas Schick, has over 20 years of experience in the oil and gas industry, having co-founded American Resources, Inc., and formerly serving in executive, management and operational planning, strategy and finance roles at Highland Oil and Gas, Mariner Energy, Inc., The Houston Exploration Co., ConocoPhillips and Shell Oil Company. In addition, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, Clark R. Moore, has over 13 years of energy industry experience, and formerly served as acting general counsel of Erin Energy Corp. Several other members of the management team have also successfully helped develop similar companies with like kind asset profiles and technical operations at Sheridan Production Company, Trinity Operating LLC, Baker Hughes and Halliburton. We believe that our management team is highly qualified to identify, acquire and exploit energy resources in the U.S.
  
 Our operations team has extensive experience in horizontal development of conventional assets in the Permian Basin at Sheridan Production Company and experience drilling and completing unconventional wells in the D-J Basin at Baker Hughes and Halliburton.
  
 Our board of directors also brings extensive oil and gas industry experience, headed by our Chairman, John J. Scelfo, who brings nearly 40 years of experience in oil and gas management, finance and accounting, and who served in numerous executive-level capacities at Hess Corporation, including as Senior Vice President, Finance and Corporate Development, Chief Financial Officer, Worldwide Exploration & Producing, and as a member of Hess’ Executive Committee. In addition, our Board includes Ivar Siem, who brings over 50 years of broad experience from both the upstream and the service segments of the oil and gas industry, including serving as Chairman of Blue Dolphin Energy Company (OTCQX: BDCO), as Chairman and interim CEO of DI Industries/Grey Wolf Drilling, as Chairman and CEO of Seateam Technology ASA, and in various executive roles at multiple E&P and oil field service companies. Furthermore, our Board includes H. Douglas Evans, who brings over 40 years of experience in executive management positions with Gulf Interstate Engineering Company, one of the world's top pipeline design and engineering firms, including as its current Chairman and previously its President and Chief Executive Officer, and who is a past President and current Board member of the International Pipe Line and Offshore Contractors Association, current Chairman of its Strategy Committee, and an active member of the Pipeline Contractors Association.
 
 Significant acreage positions and drilling potential. As of December 31, 2018, we have accumulated interests in a total of approximately 23,441 net acres in our core Permian Basin Asset operating area, and 11,948 net acres in our core D-J Basin Asset operating area, both of which we believe represent significant upside potential. The majority of our interests are in or near areas of considerable activity by both major and independent operators, although such activity may not be indicative of our future operations. Based on our current acreage position, we believe our current Permian Basin Asset could contain over 195 potential net wells based on currently identified drilling locations using 120-acre spacing, and our D-J Basin Asset could contain up to approximately 149 potential net wells based on 80-acre spacing, providing us with a substantial drilling inventory for future years.

  Marketing
  
 We generally sell a significant portion of our oil and gas production to a relatively small number of customers, and during the year ended December 31, 2018, sales to one customer comprised 47% of the Company’s total oil and gas revenues. The Company is not dependent upon any one purchaser and believes that, if its primary customers are unable or unwilling to continue to purchase the Company’s production, there are a substantial number of alternative buyers for its production at comparable prices.
  
 Oil. Our crude oil is generally sold under short-term, extendable and cancellable agreements with unaffiliated purchasers. As a consequence, the prices we receive for crude oil move up and down in direct correlation with the oil market as it reacts to supply and demand factors. Transportation costs related to moving crude oil are also deducted from the price received for crude oil.
  
 We are a party to a six-month crude oil purchase contract with a third party buyer, expiring June 30, 2019, pursuant to which the buyer purchases the crude oil produced from our 18 operated wells in our D-J Basin Asset, at a price per barrel equal to the average of the New York Mercantile Exchange’s ("NYMEX") daily settle quoted price for Cushing/WTI for trade days only during a calendar month, applicable to product delivered during any such calendar month, less a per barrel differential of $6.60. The crude oil is purchased at the wellhead, and we do not bear any incremental transportation costs.
  
 In connection with our September 2018 acquisition of certain Permian Basin assets from Ridgeway Arizona Oil Corp. (which we subsequently acquired), we also became a party to a month-to-month crude oil purchase contract with a third party buyer, pursuant to which the buyer purchases the crude oil produced from our 69 operated wells in our Permian Basin Asset, at a price per barrel equal to the average of the NYMEX daily settle quoted price for Cushing/WTI for trade days only during a calendar month, applicable to product delivered during any such calendar month, less a per barrel differential of $3.64. The crude oil is purchased at the wellhead, and we do not bear any incremental transportation costs.
  
 Natural Gas. Our natural gas is sold under both long-term and short-term natural gas purchase agreements. Natural gas produced by us is sold at various delivery points at or near producing wells to both unaffiliated independent marketing companies and unaffiliated mid-stream companies. We receive proceeds from prices that are based on various pipeline indices less any associated fees for processing, location or transportation differentials.
  
 We are a party to a Gas Purchase Contract, dated December 1, 2011, with DCP Midstream, LP (which we refer to as “DCP”), pursuant to which we sell to DCP all gas produced from nine of our D-J Basin Asset operated wells and surrounding lands located in Weld County, Colorado, at a purchase price equal to 83% of the net weighted average value for gas attributable to us that is received by DCP at its facilities sold during the month, less a $0.06/gallon local fractionation fee for NGLs, for a period of ten years ending December 1, 2021, after which time the contract reverts to a month-to-month basis and is subject to cancellation by either party at any time upon at least thirty (30) days advance notice.
  
 We also became a party to a Gas Purchase Agreement, dated April 1, 2012, as amended, with Sterling Energy Investments LLC, which we refer to as Sterling, pursuant to which we sell to Sterling all gas produced from nine of our D-J Basin Asset wells and surrounding lands located in Weld County, Colorado, at a purchase price equal to 85% of the revenue received by Sterling from the sale of gas after processing at Sterling’s plant that is attributable to us during the month, less a $0.50/Mcf gathering fee, subject to escalation, for a period of twenty years, terminating April 1, 2032.
  
  Oil and Gas Properties
  
 We believe that our Permian Basin and D-J Basin assets represent among the most economic oil and natural gas plays in the U.S. We plan to opportunistically seek additional acreage proximate to our currently held core acreage located in the Northwest Shelf of the Permian Basin in Chaves and Roosevelt Counties, New Mexico, and the Wattenberg and Wattenberg Extension areas of Weld County, Colorado in the D-J Basin. Our strategy is to be the operator, directly or through our subsidiaries and joint ventures, in the majority of our acreage so we can dictate the pace of development in order to execute our business plan. The majority of our capital expenditure budget for 2019 will be focused on the development of our Permian Basin Asset, and secondarily on development of our D-J Basin Asset. 
  
 Unless otherwise noted, the following table presents summary data for our leasehold acreage in our core Permian Basin Asset and D-J Basin Asset as of December 31, 2018 and our drilling capital budget with respect to this acreage from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019. If commodity prices drop significantly, we may delay drilling activities. The ultimate amount of capital we will expend may fluctuate materially based on, among other things, market conditions, commodity prices, asset monetizations, non-operated project proposals, the success of our drilling results as the year progresses, and availability of capital (see “Part I” – “Item 1A. Risk Factors”.)

  Our Core Areas
  
  Permian Basin Asset
 
 Effective September 1, 2018, we acquired 100% of the assets of Hunter Oil Company, which assets we refer to as our “Permian Basin Asset,” and which assets we hold through our wholly-owned subsidiary, PEDCO, with operations conducted through PEDCO’s wholly-owned operating subsidiaries, EOR Operating Company and Ridgeway Arizona Oil Corp. These interests are all located in Chaves and Roosevelt Counties, New Mexico, where we currently operate 337 gross (337 net) wells of which 51wells are active producers, 18 wells are active injectors, and one well is an active SWD. As of December 31, 2018, our Permian Basin Asset acreage is located in the areas shaded in yellow in the sectional map below.

 It is currently estimated that there are approximately 110 billion barrels of oil-in-place in San Andres reservoirs across the Permian Basin (Research Partnership to Secure Energy for America (“RPSEA”) report dated December 21, 2015). The San Andres oilfields of the Northwest Shelf, Central Basin Platform and the Eastern Shelf are some of the largest oilfields within the Permian Basin. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”), as of December 31, 2013, three oil fields that have produced from the San Andres formation were amongst the top 50 largest oilfields by reserves in the United States. The San Andres has been historically under-developed due to technological and economic limitations during early development. The San Andres is a dolomitic carbonate reservoir characterized as being highly-heterogenous with a multi-porosity system that typically shows significant oil saturation, but primary production often yields higher than normal water cut. While existing San Andres operators may ascribe different drivers for the water cut, San Andres production requires sufficient fluid removal, transportation and disposal in order to achieve higher oil cuts, through a network of on-site fluid storage and saltwater disposal systems.
 
 Oil was originally trapped in the San Andres by three types of pre-Tertiary traps: Structural, Stratigraphic and Structurally enhanced Stratigraphic. Legacy fields exist where oil accumulated in these traps to form thick oil columns, referred to as Main Pay Zones (“MPZ”). Legacy San Andres fields lack sharp oil-water contacts creating secondary zones of increasing water saturation beneath the MPZ known as Transitional Oil Zones (“TOZ”) and Residual Oil Zones (“ROZ”). TOZs and ROZs also extend outside the historical boundaries of the legacy fields downdip to their structural limits. The vast majority of horizontal San Andres wells have been drilled in these TOZ and ROZ areas where vertical development is uneconomic.
 
 The Company’s 23,441 net acres within the Chaveroo and Milnesand fields of Chaves and Roosevelt Counties, New Mexico offer a rare opportunity to drill infill horizontal wells targeting the higher oil-saturations of the MPZs. There are currently 337 wellbores within the leasehold, of which 51 are active producers and 18 are active injectors, and one is an active SWD. The remainder are shut-in wellbores with future potential utility for additional water injection, production reactivations, and behind-pipe recompletions. We currently own and operate two water handling facilities, one in each field, that have a current combined capacity of approximately 32,000 barrels of water per day (bbl/d).

  D-J Basin Asset
  
 We have grown our legacy D-J Basin Asset position to 11,948 net acres following the August 1, 2018 acquisition of 2,340 net acres held by production and four operated wells in Weld and Morgan Counties, Colorado, discussed above. We directly hold all of our interests in the D-J Basin Asset through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Red Hawk. These interests are all located in Weld County, Colorado. Red Hawk has an interest in 69 gross (21.5 net) wells and is currently the operator of 18 gross (16.2 net) wells located in our D-J Basin Asset. Our D-J Basin Asset acreage is located in the areas circled in the map below. The D-J Basin has seen a tremendous amount of growth in drilling activity in the past 12 months. D-J Basin operators are now drilling 16 to 24 horizontal wells per section in the Niobrara and Codell formations, utilizing the latest advances in completion design, frac stages, and frac intensity to obtain favorable well results. Notable non-operated partners leading the Niobrara revival are Noble Energy, Extraction Oil & Gas, SRC Energy and Bonanza Creek.

 As of December 31, 2018, production from our recent acquisition of the Chaveroo and Milnesand fields in the third quarter 2018 are the fields that each comprise 15% or more of our total proved reserves. In prior periods, the Wattenberg field is the only field that comprised 15% or more of our total proved reserves. The applicable production volumes from these fields for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 is represented in the table below in total barrels (Bbls):
  
 
 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016

Milnesand | 2,917 | - | - 
Wattenberg | 66,220 | 46,198 | 49,316


 
 The following table summarizes our gross and net developed and undeveloped leasehold and mineral fee acreage at December 31, 2018:
  
 
 | Total | Developed (1) | Undeveloped (2)
--------------+---------+---------------+----------------
 | Gross | Net | Gross | Net | Gross | Net 
D-J Basin | 205,994 | 11,948 | 183,370 | 9,388 | 22,624 | 2,560
Permian Basin | 23,829 | 23,441 | 20,783 | 20,555 | 3,046 | 2,886
Total | 229,823 | 35,389 | 204,153 | 29,943 | 25,670 | 5,446


 
 (1) Developed acreage is the number of acres that are allocated or assignable to producing wells or wells capable of production.
  
 (2) Undeveloped acreage is lease acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage includes proved reserves.

 We believe we have satisfactory title, in all material respects, to substantially all of our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry.
  
  Total Net Undeveloped Acreage Expiration
  
 In the event that production is not established or we take no action to extend or renew the terms of our leases, our net undeveloped acreage that will expire over the next three years as of December 31, 2018 is 49, 170 and 2,566 for the years ending December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. We expect to retain substantially all of our expiring acreage either through drilling activities, renewal of the expiring leases or through the exercise of extension options.

At December 31, 2018, the Company’s total estimated proved reserves were 12.4 million Boe of which 11.5 million Bbls were crude oil reserves, and 5.4 million Mcf were natural gas and NGL reserves.
  
   
19


  
 
 Internal Controls. Clayton Riddle, our Vice President of Development (a non-executive position), is the technical person primarily responsible for our internal reserves estimation process (which are based upon the best available production, engineering and geologic data) and provides oversight of the annual audit of our year end reserves by our independent third party engineers. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering with in excess of 15 years of oil and gas experience, including in excess of five years as a reserves estimator and is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers.
  
 The preparation of our reserve estimates is in accordance with our prescribed procedures that include verification of input data into a reserve forecasting and economic software, as well as management review. Our reserve analysis includes, but is not limited to, the following:
  
   ●
 Research of operators near our lease acreage. Review operating and technological techniques, as well as reserve projections of such wells.

   ●
 The review of internal reserve estimates by well and by area by a qualified petroleum engineer. A variance by well to the previous year-end reserve report is used as a tool in this process.

   ●
 SEC-compliant internal policies to determine and report proved reserves.

   ●
 The discussion of any material reserve variances among management to ensure the best estimate of remaining reserves.

 
 Qualifications of Third Party Engineers. The technical person primarily responsible for the audit of our reserves estimates at Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc. is W.

  Material Events During the Year Ended December 31, 2018
  
  SK Energy Note and Related Transactions
  
 On June 26, 2018, the Company borrowed $7.7 million from SK Energy, which amount was evidenced by a Promissory Note dated June 25, 2018, in the amount of $7.7 million (the “SK Energy Note”). SK Energy is 100% owned and controlled by Dr. Simon Kukes, our Chief Executive Officer and director. The SK Energy Note accrues interest monthly at 8% per annum, payable quarterly (beginning October 15, 2018), in either cash or shares of common stock (at the option of the Company), or with the consent of SK Energy, such interest may be accrued and capitalized. If interest on the SK Energy Note is paid in common stock, SK Energy will be due that number of shares of common stock as equals the amount due divided by the average of the closing sales prices of the Company’s common stock for the ten trading days immediately preceding the last day of the calendar quarter prior to the applicable payment date, rounded up to the nearest whole share of common stock (the “Interest Shares”). The SK Energy Note is due and payable on June 25, 2021, but may be prepaid at any time, without penalty. Other than in connection with the Interest Shares. The SK Energy Note contains standard and customary events of default and upon the occurrence of an event of default, the amount owed under the SK Energy Note accrues interest at 10% per annum. As additional consideration for SK Energy agreeing to the terms of the SK Energy Note, the Company issued SK Energy 600,000 shares of common stock (the “Loan Shares”).
  
 As part of the same transaction and as a required condition to closing the sale of the SK Energy Note, SK Energy entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Golden Globe Energy (US), LLC (“GGE”), the then holder of our outstanding 66,625 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (convertible pursuant to their terms into 6,662,500 shares of the Company’s common stock – 47.6% of the Company’s then outstanding shares post-conversion), pursuant to which on June 25, 2018, SK Energy purchased, for $100,000, all of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock).

  Debt Restructuring
  
 On June 25, 2018, the Company entered into Debt Repayment Agreements (the “Repayment Agreements”, each described in greater detail below) with (i) the holders of our then outstanding Tranche A Secured Promissory Notes (“Tranche A Notes”) and Tranche B Secured Promissory Notes (“Tranche B Notes”), which the Company entered into pursuant to the terms of the May 12, 2016 Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement, (ii) RJ Credit LLC (“RJC”), which held a subordinated promissory note issued by the Company pursuant to that certain Note and Security Agreement, dated April 10, 2014, as amended (the “RJC Subordinated Note”), and (iii) MIE Jurassic Energy Corporation, which held a subordinated promissory note issued by the Company pursuant to that certain Amended and Restated Secured Subordinated Promissory Note, dated February 18, 2015, as amended (the “MIEJ Note”, and together with the “Tranche B Notes,” the “Junior Notes”), pursuant to which, on June 26, 2018, the Company retired all of the then outstanding Tranche A Notes, in the aggregate amount of approximately $7,260,000 in exchange for cash paid of $3,800,000 and all of the then outstanding Junior Notes, in the aggregate amount of approximately $70,299,000, in exchange for an aggregate amount of cash paid of $3,876,000.
  
 Pursuant to the terms of the Repayment Agreement relating to the Tranche B Notes, in addition to the cash consideration due to the Tranche B Note holders, as described above, we agreed to grant to certain of the Junior Note holders their pro rata share of warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,448,472 shares of common stock of the Company (the “Repurchase Warrants”). The Repurchase Warrants have a term of three years and an exercise price equal to $0.322, one (1) cent above the closing price of the Company’s common stock on June 26, 2018.
  
 Additionally, on June 25, 2018, the Company entered into a Debt Repayment Agreement (the “Bridge Note Repayment Agreement”) with all of the holders of its convertible subordinated promissory notes issued pursuant to the Second Amendment to Secured Promissory Notes, dated March 7, 2014, originally issued on March 22, 2013 (the “Bridge Notes”), pursuant to which all of the holders, holding in aggregate $475,000 of outstanding principal amount under the Bridge Notes, agreed to the payment and full satisfaction of all outstanding amounts (including accrued interest and additional payment-in-kind) for 25% of the principal amounts owed thereunder, or an aggregate amount of cash paid of $119,000.
  
 The result of the above transactions was a net reduction of liabilities of approximately $70,728,000 that were removed from the Company’s balance sheet as of June 25, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, a gain on the settlement of all of these debts in the amount of $70,309,000 was recorded ($70,631,000, net of the expense related to the issuance of warrants to certain of the Tranche A Note holders with an estimated fair value of $322,000 based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model).
  
  NYSE American Compliance
  
 On June 27, 2018, the NYSE American (the “Exchange”) notified the Company that it had regained compliance with the NYSE American continued listing standards. Moving forward, the Company will be subject to the Exchange’s normal continued listing monitoring. In addition, in the event that the Company is again determined to be noncompliant with any of the Exchange’s continued listing standards within twelve (12) months of the notice, the Exchange will consider the relationship between the Company’s previous noncompliance and such new event of noncompliance and take appropriate action which may include implementing truncated compliance procedures or immediately initiating delisting proceedings.
 Series A Convertible Preferred Stock Amendment and Conversion
  
 In connection with the Stock Purchase Agreement, and immediately following the closing of the acquisition described in the Stock Purchase Agreement (discussed above), the Company and SK Energy, as the then holder of all of the then outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, agreed to the filing of an Amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Designations of PEDEVCO Corp. Establishing the Designations, Preferences, Limitations and Relative Rights of Its Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Amendment”), which amended the designation of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Designation”) to remove the beneficial ownership restriction contained therein, which prevented any holder of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock from converting such Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of common stock of the Company if such conversion would result in the holder thereof holding more than 9.9% of the Company’s then outstanding common stock. The Company filed the Preferred Amendment with the Secretary of State of Texas on June 26, 2018.
  
   
21


  
 
 On July 3, 2018, SK Energy converted all of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shares it acquired pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement with GGE, pursuant to their terms, into 6,662,500 shares of the Company’s common stock, representing 45.3% of the Company’s then outstanding common stock, and resulting in approximately 14,717,119 shares of the Company’s common stock being issued and outstanding. The issuance was deemed a change of control under applicable NYSE American rules and regulations, provided that such issuance was previously approved at the 2015 annual meeting of shareholders of the Company held on October 7, 2015. The conversion transaction constituted a change in control of the Company under applicable NYSE American rules and regulations. The shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, together with the Loan Shares (issued to SK Energy on June 26, 2018) totaled 49.9% of our then outstanding shares of common stock, which shares are beneficially owned by SK Energy and Dr. Kukes.
  
  Convertible Note Sales
  
 On August 1, 2018, we raised $23,600,000 through the sale of $23,600,000 in Convertible Promissory Notes (the “Convertible Notes”). A total of $22,000,000 in Convertible Notes was purchased by SK Energy; $200,000 in Convertible Notes was purchased by an executive officer of SK Energy; $500,000 in Convertible Notes was purchased by a trust affiliated with John J. Scelfo, a director of the Company; $500,000 in Convertible Notes was purchased by an entity affiliated with Ivar Siem, our director, and J. Douglas Schick, who was appointed as the President of the Company on August 1, 2018; $200,000 in Convertible Notes was purchased by H. Douglas Evans, who was appointed as a member of the Board of Directors on September 27, 2018; and $200,000 in Convertible Notes were purchased by an unaffiliated party.
  
 The Convertible Notes accrue interest monthly at 8.5% per annum, which interest is payable on the maturity date unless otherwise converted into our common stock as described below.
  
 The Convertible Notes and all accrued interest thereon are convertible into shares of our common stock, from time to time after August 29, 2018, at the option of the holders thereof, at a conversion price equal to the greater of (x) $0.10 above the greater of the book value of the Company’s common stock and the closing sales price of the Company’s common stock on the date the Convertible Notes were entered into (the “Book/Market Price”) (which was $2.13 per share); (y) $1.63 per share; and (z) the VWAP Price, defined as the volume weighted average price (calculated by aggregate trading value on each trading day) of the Company’s common stock for the 20 trading days ending August 29, 2018, which price was $2.08 per share, and which conversion price is therefore $2.13 per share.
  
 The conversion of the SK Energy Convertible Note is subject to a 49.9% conversion limitation (for so long as SK Energy or any of its affiliates holds such note), which prevents the conversion of any portion thereof into common stock of the Company if such conversion would result in SK Energy beneficially owning (as such term is defined in the Exchange Act)(“Beneficially Owning”) more than 49.9% of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock.
  
 The conversion of the other Convertible Notes is subject to a 4.99% conversion limitation, at any time such note is Beneficially Owned by any party other than (i) SK Energy or any of its affiliates (which is subject to the separate conversion limitation described above); (ii) any officer of the Company; (iii) any director of the Company; or (iv) any person which at the time of first obtaining Beneficial Ownership of the Convertible Note beneficially owns more than 9.99% of the Company’s outstanding common stock or voting stock (collectively (ii) through (iv), “Borrower Affiliates”). The Convertible Notes are not subject to a conversion limitation at any time they are owned or held by Borrower Affiliates.
  
 The Convertible Notes are due and payable on August 1, 2021, but may be prepaid at any time, without penalty. The Convertible Notes contain standard and customary events of default and upon the occurrence of an event of default, the amount owed under the Convertible Notes accrues interest at 10% per annum.
  
 The terms of the Convertible Notes may be amended or waived and such amendment or waiver shall be applicable to all of the Convertible Notes with the written consent of Convertible Note holders holding at least a majority in interest of the then aggregate dollar value of Convertible Notes outstanding.
  
  Hunter Oil Purchase and Sale Agreement and Stock Purchase Agreement
  
 On August 1, 2018, we (through our wholly-owned subsidiary PEDCO entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Milnesand Minerals Inc., a Delaware corporation, Chaveroo Minerals Inc., a Delaware corporation, Ridgeway Arizona Oil Corp., an Arizona corporation (“RAOC”), and EOR Operating Company, a Texas corporation (“EOR”)(collectively “Seller”)(the “Purchase Agreement”). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, PEDCO agreed to acquire certain oil and gas assets described in greater detail below (the “Assets”) from the Seller in consideration for $18,500,000 (of which $500,000 is to be held back to provide for potential indemnification of PEDCO under the Purchase Agreement and Stock Purchase Agreement (described below), with one-half ($250,000) to be released to Seller 90 days after closing (which amount has been released to date) and the balance ($250,000) to be released 180 days after closing (provided that if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any part of the amount withheld by PEDCO subsequent to 180 days after closing was in fact due to the Seller, PEDCO is required to pay Seller 200%, instead of 100%, of the amount so retained)).
  
   
22


  
 
 On August 31, 2018, we closed the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and acquired the Assets for an aggregate of $18.5 million. The effective date of the acquisition was September 1, 2018.
  
 The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of the parties, and indemnification requirements (subject to a $25,000 aggregate minimum threshold and a $1,000,000 cap as to each of buyer and seller).  The Purchase Agreement allows PEDCO to audit the revenues and expenses of the Seller attributable to the Assets for the period of three years prior to the closing, among other things, and requires the Seller to provide assistance to PEDCO in connection with such audit for the first 180 days following closing (with such Seller’s reasonable costs associated with such audit being reimbursed by PEDCO at the rate of 150% of such costs).
  
 The Assets represent approximately 23,441 net leasehold acres, current operated production, and all of Seller’s leases and related rights, oil and gas and other wells, equipment, easements, contract rights, and production (effective as of the effective date) as described in the Purchase Agreement. The Assets are located in the San Andres play in the Permian Basin situated in west Texas and eastern New Mexico, with all acreage and production 100% operated and substantially all acreage held by production. See also the more detailed description of the Assets under “Oil and Gas Properties”, below.
  
 Also on August 1, 2018, PEDCO entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Hunter Oil Production Corp. (“Hunter Oil”). Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, which closed on August 31, 2018, PEDCO acquired all of the stock of RAOC and EOR (the “Acquired Companies”) for a net of $500,000 (an aggregate purchase price of $2,816,000, less $2,316,000 in restricted cash which the Acquired Companies are required to maintain as of the closing date). The Stock Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of the parties, post-closing adjustments, and indemnification requirements requiring Hunter Oil to indemnify us for certain items (subject to the $25,000 aggregate minimum threshold and $1,000,000 cap provided for in the Purchase Agreement) and us to indemnify Hunter Oil for certain items (which requirement does not include a threshold or cap).
  
 On December 17, 2018 the Company and Seller agreed that the Company would pay to Seller $25,000 for all post-closing adjustments and post-closing support under the Purchase Agreement and accelerate the payment by the Company to Seller of the final $250,000 to be released 180 days after closing, which payments were made by the Company to Seller on December 17, 2018.
  
  Condor Acquisition
  
  On August 1, 2018, Red Hawk, our wholly-owned subsidiary entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Membership Purchase Agreement”) with MIE Jurassic Energy Corporation (“MIEJ”). Pursuant to the Membership Purchase Agreement, MIEJ sold Red Hawk 100% of the outstanding membership interests of Condor Energy Technology LLC (“Condor”) in consideration for $537,000. Condor owns approximately 2,340 net leasehold acres, 100% held by production (HBP), located in Weld and Morgan Counties, Colorado, with four operated producing wells. The Membership Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and provides that, as of the August 1, 2018 effective date, Red Hawk will assume responsibility for all costs, expenses and obligations outstanding and unpaid that are attributable to the properties as of the effective date and thereafter, and Red Hawk will also be entitled to all income and revenues received by Condor that are attributable to the properties, even if received by Condor with respect to oil and gas production prior to the effective date.
  
 The Company previously owned 20% of Condor through PEDCO, along with MIEJ, which then held 80% of Condor, until February 19, 2015, when we and PEDCO entered into a Settlement Agreement (the “MIEJ Settlement Agreement”) with MIEJ, whereby, among other things, PEDCO sold its full 20% interest in Condor to MIEJ. Additionally, until June 25, 2018, when such amount was repaid pursuant to a Debt Repayment Agreement (described in greater detail in the Current Report on Form 8-K which we filed with the SEC on June 25, 2018), we owed approximately $6.4 million to MIEJ pursuant to the terms of a Secured Subordinated Promissory Note (the “MIEJ Note”).
  
  Warrant Repurchase Agreements
  
 On August 31, 2018, we entered into warrant repurchase agreements with certain of the Junior Note holders who received Repurchase Warrants, namely Senior Health Insurance Company of Pennsylvania, Principal Growth Strategies, LLC, and RJ Credit LLC (collectively, the “Warrant Holders”). Pursuant to the warrant repurchase agreements, the Company repurchased warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,105,935 shares of the Company’s common stock (the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of which such Repurchase Warrants, the “Warrant Shares”) held by the Warrant Holders, which warrants had a term of three years (through August 25, 2021) and an exercise price equal to $0.322 per share, as discussed above under “Debt Restructuring”. The Repurchase Warrants were repurchased for an aggregate of $1,095,000 or $0.99 per Warrant Share, which amount the Company paid to the Warrant Holders on September 17, 2018. Effective on the date of payment of the warrant purchase amounts, the Repurchase Warrants and the agreements evidencing such Repurchase Warrants were deemed to have been repurchased by the Company and cancelled. The Warrant Repurchase Agreements also included a release by which the Warrant Holders released the Company from any liability or claims associated with the Repurchase Warrants and certain of the Warrant Repurchase Agreements included a release by which we released the applicable Warrant Holders party thereto. The terms of the Warrant Repurchase Agreements were individually negotiated with each associated group of Warrant Holders.

 Convertible Notes Amendment and Conversion
  
 On February 15, 2019, the Company and SK Energy agreed to amend the Convertible Notes and October 2018 Convertible Note described in Note 7, as well as the January 2019 Convertible Note, whereby each of the notes were amended to remove the conversion limitation that previously prevented SK Energy from converting any portion of the notes into common stock of the Company if such conversion would have resulted in SK Energy beneficially owning more than 49.9% of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock
  
 Immediately following the entry into the Amendment, on February 15, 2019, SK Energy elected to convert (i) all $15,000,000 of the outstanding principal and all $125,729 of accrued interest under the January 2019 Note into common stock of the Company at a conversion price of $1.50 per share as set forth in the January 2019 Note into 10,083,819 shares of restricted common stock of the Company, and (ii) all $7,000,000 of the outstanding principal and all $186,776 of accrued interest under the October 2018 Note into common stock of the Company at a conversion price of $1.79 per share as set forth in the October 2018 Note into 4,014,959 shares of restricted common stock of the Company, which shares in aggregate represented approximately 47.1% of the Company’s then 29,907,223 shares of issued and outstanding Company common stock after giving effect to the conversions.

  SK Energy Note Amendment; Note Purchases and Conversion
  
 On March 1, 2019, the Company and SK Energy entered into a First SK Energy Note Amendment to Promissory Note (the “SK Energy Note Amendment”) which amended the $7.7 million principal amount SK Energy Note, to provide SK Energy the right, at any time, at its option, to convert the principal and interest owed under such SK Energy Note, into shares of the Company’s common stock, at a conversion price of $2.13 per share. The SK Energy Note previously only included a conversion feature whereby the Company had the option to pay quarterly interest payments on the SK Energy Note in shares of Company common stock instead of cash, at a conversion price per share calculated based on the average closing sales price of the Company’s common stock on the NYSE American for the ten trading days immediately preceding the last day of the calendar quarter immediately prior to the quarterly payment date.
  
 In addition, on March 1, 2019, the holders of $1,500,000 in aggregate principal amount of Convertible Promissory Notes issued by the Company on August 1, 2018 (the “August 2018 Notes”) sold their August 2018 Notes at face value plus accrued and unpaid interest through March 1, 2019 to SK Energy (the “August 2018 Note Sale”). Holders which sold their August 2018 Notes pursuant to the August 2018 Note Sale to SK Energy include an executive officer of SK Energy ($200,000 in principal amount of August 2018 Notes); a trust affiliated with John J. Scelfo, a director of the Company ($500,000 in principal amount of August 2018 Notes); an entity affiliated with Ivar Siem, a director of the Company, and J. Douglas Schick the President of the Company ($500,000 in principal amount of August 2018 Notes); and Harold Douglas Evans, a director of the Company ($200,000 in principal amount of August 2018 Notes).
  
 Following the August 2018 Note Sale, the Company’s sole issued and outstanding debt was the (i) $7,700,000 in principal, plus accrued interest, under the SK Energy Note held by SK Energy, (ii) an aggregate of $23,500,000 in principal, plus accrued interest, under the August 2018 Notes and SK Energy $22 million Convertible Note held by SK Energy, and (iii) $100,000 in principal, plus accrued interest, under an August 2018 Note held by an unaffiliated holder (the “Unaffiliated Holder”).
  
 Immediately following the effectiveness of the SK Energy Note Amendment and August 2018 Note Sale, on March 1, 2019, SK Energy and the Unaffiliated Holder elected to convert all $31,300,000 of outstanding principal and an aggregate of $1,462,818 of accrued interest under the SK Energy Note, SK Energy $22 million Convertible Note and August 2018 Notes into common stock of the Company at a conversion price of $2.13 per share (the “Conversion Price” and the “Conversions”) as set forth in the SK Energy Note, as amended, and the August 2018 Notes and SK Energy $22 million Convertible Note (collectively, the “Notes”), into an aggregate of 15,381,605 shares of restricted common stock of the Company (the “Conversion Shares”).
  
 As a result of the Conversions, as of the date of the report, the Company now has no debt on its balance sheet and 45,288,828 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.
  
  Regulation of the Oil and Gas Industry
  
 All of our oil and gas operations are substantially affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Historically, our compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, we are unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance.
  
 Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by Congress, the states, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the “FERC”) and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective. We do not believe that we would be affected by any such action materially differently than similarly situated competitors.
  
 At the state level, our operations in Colorado are regulated by the Colorado Oil & Gas Conservation Commission (“COGCC”) and our New Mexico operations are regulated by the Conservation Division of the New Mexico Energy, Minerals, and Natural Resources Department (regulates oil and gas operations) and New Mexico Environment Department (administers environmental protection laws). The Oil Conservation Division of the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department requires the posting of financial assurance for owners and operators on privately owned or state land within New Mexico in order to provide for abandonment restoration and remediation of wells.
  
   
25


  

 The COGCC regulates oil and gas operators through rules, policies, written guidance, orders, permits, and inspections. Among other things, the COGCC enforces specifications regarding drilling, development, production, reclamation, enhanced recovery, safety, aesthetics, noise, waste, flowlines, and wildlife.  In recent years, the COGCC has amended its existing regulatory requirements and adopted new requirements with increased frequency. For example, in January 2016, the COGCC approved new rules that require local government consultation and certain best management practices for large-scale oil and natural gas facilities in certain urban mitigation areas. These rules also require operator registration and/or notifications to local governments with respect to future oil and natural gas drilling and production facility locations. In February 2018, the COGCC comprehensively amended its regulations for oil, gas, and water flowlines to expand requirements addressing flowline registration and safety, integrity management, leak detection, and other matters. The COGCC has also adopted or amended numerous other rules in recent years, including rules relating to safety, flood protection, and spill reporting. In December 2018, the COGCC approved new rules that require new oil and gas sites to be situated at least 1,000 feet away from school properties such as playgrounds and athletic fields.
  
 We anticipate that the COGCC, the Conservation Division of the New Mexico Energy, Minerals, and Natural Resources Department and New Mexico Environment Department will continue to adopt new rules and regulations moving forward which will likely affect our oil and gas operations, and could make it more costly for our operations or limit our activities. We routinely monitor our operations and new rules and regulations which may affect our operations, to ensure that we maintain compliance.
  
  Regulation Affecting Production
  
 The production of oil and natural gas is subject to United States federal and state laws and regulations, and orders of regulatory bodies under those laws and regulations, governing a wide variety of matters. All of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate producing oil and natural gas properties have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas, including provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process, and the abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells which may be drilled in an area, and the unitization or pooling of oil or natural gas wells, as well as regulations that generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and gas we can drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, NGL and gas within its jurisdiction.
  
 States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct regulation, but there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future. The effect of such future regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil and gas that may be produced from our wells, negatively affect the economics of production from these wells or limit the number of locations we can drill.
  
 The failure to comply with the rules and regulations of oil and natural gas production and related operations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations.
  
  Regulation Affecting Sales and Transportation of Commodities
  
 Sales prices of gas, oil, condensate and NGL are not currently regulated and are made at market prices. Although prices of these energy commodities are currently unregulated, the United States Congress historically has been active in their regulation. We cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil and gas, or the prices charged for these commodities might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by the United States Congress or the various state legislatures and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on our operations. Sales of oil and natural gas may be subject to certain state and federal reporting requirements.
  
The price and terms of service of transportation of the commodities, including access to pipeline transportation capacity, are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. Such regulation may affect the marketing of oil and natural gas produced by the Company, as well as the revenues received for sales of such production. Gathering systems may be subject to state ratable take and common purchaser statutes. Ratable take statutes generally require gatherers to take, without undue discrimination, oil and natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling. Similarly, common purchaser statutes generally require gatherers to purchase, or accept for gathering, without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply. These statutes may affect whether and to what extent gathering capacity is available for oil and natural gas production, if any, of the drilling program and the cost of such capacity. Further state laws and regulations govern rates and terms of access to intrastate pipeline systems, which may similarly affect market access and cost.

 The FERC regulates interstate natural gas pipeline transportation rates and service conditions. The FERC is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting interstate transportation. The stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to ensure terms and conditions of interstate transportation service are not unduly discriminatory or unduly preferential, to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry and to promote market transparency. We do not believe that our drilling program will be affected by any such FERC action in a manner materially differently than other similarly situated natural gas producers.
  
 In addition to the regulation of natural gas pipeline transportation, FERC has additional, jurisdiction over the purchase or sale of gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to FERC’s jurisdiction pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EPAct 2005”). Under the EPAct 2005, it is unlawful for “any entity,” including producers such as us, that are otherwise not subject to FERC’s jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”) to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to regulation by FERC, in contravention of rules prescribed by FERC. FERC’s rules implementing this provision make it unlawful, in connection with the purchase or sale of gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, to use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. EPAct 2005 also gives FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 up to $1.2 million per day, per violation. The anti-manipulation rule applies to activities of otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which includes the annual reporting requirements under FERC Order No. 704 (defined below).
  
 In December 2007, FERC issued a final rule on the annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements, as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing (“Order No. 704”). Under Order No. 704, any market participant, including a producer that engages in certain wholesale sales or purchases of gas that equal or exceed 2.2 trillion BTUs of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year, must annually report such sales and purchases to FERC on Form No. 552 on May 1 of each year. Form No. 552 contains aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to the formation of price indices. Not all types of natural gas sales are required to be reported on Form No. 552. It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order No. 704. Order No. 704 is intended to increase the transparency of the wholesale gas markets and to assist FERC in monitoring those markets and in detecting market manipulation.
  
 The FERC also regulates rates and terms and conditions of service on interstate transportation of liquids, including oil and NGL, under the Interstate Commerce Act, as it existed on October 1, 1977 (“ICA”). Prices received from the sale of liquids may be affected by the cost of transporting those products to market. The ICA requires that certain interstate liquids pipelines maintain a tariff on file with FERC. The tariff sets forth the established rates as well as the rules and regulations governing the service. The ICA requires, among other things, that rates and terms and conditions of service on interstate common carrier pipelines be “just and reasonable.” Such pipelines must also provide jurisdictional service in a manner that is not unduly discriminatory or unduly preferential. Shippers have the power to challenge new and existing rates and terms and conditions of service before FERC.
 
The rates charged by many interstate liquids pipelines are currently adjusted pursuant to an annual indexing methodology established and regulated by FERC, under which pipelines increase or decrease their rates in accordance with an index adjustment specified by FERC. For the five-year period beginning July 1, 2016, FERC established an annual index adjustment equal to the change in the producer price index for finished goods plus 1.23%. This adjustment is subject to review every five years. Under FERC’s regulations, a liquids pipeline can request a rate increase that exceeds the rate obtained through application of the indexing methodology by obtaining market-based rate authority (demonstrating the pipeline lacks market power), establishing rates by settlement with all existing shippers, or through a cost-of-service approach (if the pipeline establishes that a substantial divergence exists between the actual costs experienced by the pipeline and the rates resulting from application of the indexing methodology). Increases in liquids transportation rates may result in lower revenue and cash flows for the Company.
  
 In addition, due to common carrier regulatory obligations of liquids pipelines, capacity must be prorated among shippers in an equitable manner in the event there are nominations in excess of capacity or for new shippers. Therefore, new shippers or increased volume by existing shippers may reduce the capacity available to us. Any prolonged interruption in the operation or curtailment of available capacity of the pipelines that we rely upon for liquids transportation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. However, we believe that access to liquids pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our similarly situated competitors.
  
   
27


  
 
 Rates for intrastate pipeline transportation of liquids are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate liquids pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate liquids pipeline rates, varies from state to state. We believe that the regulation of liquids pipeline transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is materially different from the effects on our similarly situated competitors.
  
 In addition to FERC’s regulations, we are required to observe anti-market manipulation laws with regard to our physical sales of energy commodities. In November 2009, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) issued regulations pursuant to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, intended to prohibit market manipulation in the petroleum industry. Violators of the regulations face civil penalties of up to $1 million per violation per day. In July 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act, which incorporated an expansion of the authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) to prohibit market manipulation in the markets regulated by the CFTC. This authority, with respect to oil swaps and futures contracts, is similar to the anti-manipulation authority granted to the FTC with respect to oil purchases and sales. In July 2011, the CFTC issued final rules to implement their new anti-manipulation authority. The rules subject violators to a civil penalty of up to the greater of $1.1 million or triple the monetary gain to the person for each violation.
  
  Regulation of Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters
  
 Our operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations governing occupational safety and health aspects of our operations, the discharge of materials into the environment and environmental protection. Numerous governmental entities, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and analogous state agencies have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, often requiring difficult and costly actions. These laws and regulations may, among other things (i) require the acquisition of permits to conduct drilling and other regulated activities; (ii) restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment or injected into formations in connection with oil and natural gas drilling and production activities; (iii) limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; (iv) require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells; (v) apply specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; and (vi) impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling and production operations. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of corrective or remedial obligations, the occurrence of delays or restrictions in permitting or performance of projects, and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of our operations.
  
These laws and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly well drilling, construction, completion or water management activities, or waste handling, storage transport, disposal, or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. We may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to our customers. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. Continued compliance with existing requirements is not expected to materially affect us. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to remain in compliance in the future with such existing or any new laws and regulations or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.
  
 Additionally, on January 14, 2019, in Martinez v. Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, the Colorado Supreme Court overturned a ruling by the Colorado Court of Appeals that held that the Colorado Oil & Gas Conservation Commission (“COGCC”) had held that the COGCC concluded that it lacked statutory authority to undertake a proposed rulemaking “to suspend the issuance of permits that allow hydraulic fracturing until it can be done without adversely impacting human health and safety and without impairing Colorado’s atmospheric resource and climate system, water, soil, wildlife, or other biological resources.” The Colorado Court of Appeals concluded that Colorado’s Oil and Gas Conservation Act mandated that oil and gas development “be regulated subject to the protection of public health, safety, and welfare, including protection of the environment and wildlife resources.” In the Colorado Supreme Court’s majority opinion, Justice Richard L. Gabriel wrote the COGCC is required first to “foster the development of oil and gas resources” and second “to prevent and mitigate significant environmental impacts to the extent necessary to protect public health, safety and welfare, but only after taking into consideration cost-effectiveness and technical feasibility.”
  
   
28


  
 
 The following is a summary of the more significant existing and proposed environmental and occupational safety and health laws, as amended from time to time, to which our business operations are or may be subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.
  
  Hazardous Substances and Wastes
  
 The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Pursuant to rules issued by the EPA, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters, and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development, and production of oil or natural gas, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under RCRA and, instead, are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas drilling and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. Stricter regulation of wastes generated during our operations could result in an increase in our, as well as the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry’s, costs to manage and dispose of wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
  
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the current and former owners and operators of the site where the release occurred and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. We generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances.
  
 We currently lease or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas exploration, production and processing for many years. Although we believe that we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes, or petroleum hydrocarbons may have been released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us, or on, under or from other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been taken for treatment or disposal. In addition, some of our properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, or petroleum hydrocarbons was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on, under or from them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to undertake response or corrective measures, which could include removal of previously disposed substances and wastes, cleanup of contaminated property or performance of remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination, the costs of which could be substantial.
  
  Water Discharges
  
 The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and hazardous substances, into state waters and waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements imposed under the CWA require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. The CWA also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by permit. In June 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”) published a final rule to revise the definition of "waters of the United States" (“WOTUS”) for all Clean Water Act programs, but legal challenges to this rule followed and the rule was stayed nationwide by the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in October 2015. In response to this decision, the EPA and the Corps resumed nationwide use of the agencies' prior regulations defining the term "waters of the United States." However, in January 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the rule revising the WOTUS definition must first be reviewed in the federal district courts, which could result in a withdrawal of the stay by the Sixth Circuit. In addition, the EPA has issued proposals to repeal the rule revising the WOTUS definition and to delay its implementation until 2020 to allow time for the EPA to reconsider the definition of the term "waters of the United States." To the extent this rule or a revised rule expands the scope of the CWA's jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas in connection with any expansion activities. Federal and state regulatory agencies may impose substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as other enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations, including spills and other non-authorized discharges. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations.
  
 
   
29


  
 
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”), amends the CWA and sets minimum standards for prevention, containment and cleanup of oil spills. The OPA applies to vessels, offshore facilities, and onshore facilities, including exploration and production facilities that may affect waters of the United States. Under OPA, responsible parties including owners and operators of onshore facilities may be held strictly liable for oil cleanup costs and natural resource damages as well as a variety of public and private damages that may result from oil spills. The OPA also requires owners or operators of certain onshore facilities to prepare Facility Response Plans for responding to a worst-case discharge of oil into waters of the United States.
  
  Subsurface Injections
  
 In the course of our operations, we produce water in addition to oil and natural gas. Water that is not recycled may be disposed of in disposal wells, which inject the produced water into non-producing subsurface formations. Underground injection operations are regulated pursuant to the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program established under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) and analogous state laws. The UIC program requires permits from the EPA or an analogous state agency for the construction and operation of disposal wells, establishes minimum standards for disposal well operations, and restricts the types and quantities of fluids that may be disposed. A change in UIC disposal well regulations or the inability to obtain permits for new disposal wells in the future may affect our ability to dispose of produced water and ultimately increase the cost of our operations. For example, in response to recent seismic events near belowground disposal wells used for the injection of oil and natural gas-related wastewaters, regulators in some states, including Colorado, have imposed more stringent permitting and operating requirements for produced water disposal wells. In Colorado, permit applications are reviewed specifically to evaluate seismic activity and, as of 2011, the state has required operators to identify potential faults near proposed wells, if earthquakes historically occurred in the area, and to accept maximum injection pressures and volumes based on fracture gradient as conditions to permit approval. Additionally, legal disputes may arise based on allegations that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state or federal rules regulating waste disposal. These developments could result in additional regulation, restriction on the use of injection wells by us or by commercial disposal well vendors whom we may use from time to time to dispose of wastewater, and increased costs of compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating costs, financial condition, and results of operations.
 Air Emissions
  
 The Clean Air Act (the “CAA”) and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, such as, for example, tank batteries and compressor stations, through air emissions standards, construction and operating permitting programs and the imposition of other compliance standards. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. The need to obtain permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. Over the next several years, we may be charged royalties on natural gas losses or required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions related issues. For example, in October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the CAA, lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ground-level ozone from 75 parts per billion (“ppb”) for the 8-hour primary and secondary ozone standards to 70 ppb for both standards. In 2018, the EPA finalized the initial area designations for the 2015 ozone standard. Certain areas, such as the Denver Metro North Front Range (representing the counties (or parts thereof) South, East and North of Denver, Colorado), were designated as marginal (i.e., the lowest level of non-attainment) non-attainment (i.e., as an area that does not meet (or that contributes to ambient air quality in a nearby area that does not meet) the national primary or secondary ambient air quality standard for a NAAQS). The Denver Metro North Front Range area is currently under significant threat of being redesignated as a serious non-attainment area for ozone due to high levels detected in 2016 and 2017. Colorado is seeking an extension to the attainment date and the EPA has proposed to retroactively approve the requested extension by one year, to July 20, 2019. It is not likely that another one-year extension will be granted and the Denver Metro North Front Range area may be reclassified to serious non-attainment for 2020. Reclassification of areas or imposition of more stringent standards (including a lowering of the major source threshold for volatile organic compounds and oxides of nitrogen and the resulting increased likelihood that a source may be subject to Non-Attainment New Source Review) may make it more difficult to construct new or modified sources of air pollution in newly designated non-attainment areas. Also, states are expected to implement more stringent requirements as a result of this new final rule, which could apply to our operations. In addition, during the fall of 2016, EPA issued final Control Techniques Guidelines (“CTGs”) for reducing volatile organic compound emissions from existing oil and natural gas equipment and processes in ozone non-attainment areas, including the Denver Metro North Front Range Ozone 8-hour Non-Attainment area. In 2017, as part of the federal CTG process for oil and natural gas, Colorado undertook a stakeholder and rulemaking effort to compare the CTGs to existing Colorado requirements to ensure they meet applicable federal requirements, which resulted in revisions to Colorado's Regulation Number 7 (which relates to the control of ozone and hydrocarbons via oil and gas omissions). The new state regulations include more stringent air quality control requirements applicable to our operations. In another example, in June 2016, the EPA finalized a revised rule regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent permitting requirements. Compliance with these or other air pollution control and permitting requirements have the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects and increase our costs of development and production, which costs could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

  Regulation of GHG Emissions
  
 In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources that are already potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet “best available control technology” standards that typically will be established by state agencies. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified large, GHG emission sources in the United States, including certain onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production sources, which include certain of our operations.
  
 Federal agencies also have begun directly regulating emissions of methane, a GHG, from oil and natural gas operations. In June 2016, the EPA published the New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) Subpart OOOOa standards that require certain new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector to reduce these methane gas and volatile organic compound emissions. These Subpart OOOOa standards expand previously issued NSPS published by the EPA in 2012 and known as Subpart OOOO, by using certain equipment-specific emissions control practices. However, in April 2017, the EPA announced that it would review this methane rule for new, modified and reconstructed sources and initiated reconsideration proceedings to potentially revise or rescind portions of the rule. In June 2017, the EPA also proposed a two-year stay of certain requirements of the methane rule pending the reconsideration proceedings; however, the rule remains in effect in the meantime. Similarly, in November 2016, the federal Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) issued a final rule to reduce methane emissions by regulating venting, flaring, and leaks from oil and gas operations on federal and American Indian lands. California and New Mexico have challenged the rule in ongoing litigation. In addition, in April 2018, a coalition of states filed a lawsuit aiming to force EPA to establish guidelines for limiting methane emissions from existing sources in the oil and natural gas section; that lawsuit is currently pending.
  
 On the international level, in December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France that prepared an agreement requiring member countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. This “Paris Agreement” was signed by the United States in April 2016 and entered into force in November 2016; however, this agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions, but rather includes pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. In follow-up to an earlier announcement by President Trump, in August 2017, the U.S. Department of State officially informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States’ adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may re-enter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time.
  
 The adoption and implementation of any international, federal or state legislation or regulations that require reporting of GHG or otherwise limit emissions of GHG from our equipment and operations could result in increased costs to reduce emissions of GHG associated with our operations as well as delays or restrictions in our ability to permit GHG emissions from new or modified sources. In addition, substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil, natural gas and NGL we produce and lower the value of our reserves, which devaluation could be significant. One or more of these developments could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, it should be noted that increasing concentrations of GHG in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations. At this time, we have not developed a comprehensive plan to address the legal, economic, social or physical impacts of climate change on our operations. Finally, notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency, an autonomous intergovernmental organization involved in international energy policy, estimates that global energy demand will continue to rise and will not peak until after 2040 and oil and gas will continue to represent a substantial percentage of global energy use over that time. However, recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energy-related assets could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the energy sector.

  Hydraulic Fracturing Activities
  
  Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. We regularly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand or alternative proppant and chemicals under pressure into targeted geological formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production.  Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances. Additionally, the EPA published in June 2016 an effluent limitations guideline final rule pursuant to its authority under the SDWA prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants; asserted regulatory authority in 2014 under the SDWA over hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel and issued guidance covering such activities; and issued in 2014 a prepublication of its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, the BLM published a final rule in March 2015 establishing new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands including well casing and wastewater storage requirements and an obligation for exploration and production operators to disclose what chemicals they are using in fracturing activities. However, following years of litigation, the BLM rescinded the rule in December 2017. Additionally, from time to time, legislation has been introduced, but not enacted, in Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. In the event that a new, federal level of legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process is adopted in areas where we operate, we may incur additional costs to comply with such federal requirements that may be significant in nature, and also could become subject to additional permitting requirements and experience added delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities.
  
 At the state level, Colorado, where we conduct significant operations, is among the states that has adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure or well-construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. Moreover, states could elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the State of New York in 2015. Also, certain interest groups in Colorado opposed to oil and natural gas development generally, and hydraulic fracturing in particular, have from time to time advanced various options for ballot initiatives that, if approved, would allow revisions to the state constitution in a manner that would make such exploration and production activities in the state more difficult in the future. However, during the November 2016 voting process, one proposed amendment placed on the Colorado state ballot making it relatively more difficult to place an initiative on the state ballot was passed by the voters. As a result, there are more stringent procedures now in place for placing an initiative on a state ballot. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions may restrict drilling or the hydraulic fracturing process and cities may adopt local ordinances allowing hydraulic fracturing activities within their jurisdictions but regulating the time, place and manner of those activities.
  
 For example, on November 6, 2018, registered voters in the State of Colorado cast their ballots and rejected Proposition 112 (“Prop. 112”), with 55% of ballots cast against the measure. Prop. 112 would have created a rigid 2,500-foot setback from oil and gas facilities to the nearest occupied structure and other “vulnerable areas,” which included parks, ball fields, open space, streams, lakes and intermittent streams. It would have dramatically increased the amount of surface area off-limits to new energy development by 26 times and put 94% of private land in the top five oil and gas producing counties in the State of Colorado off-limits to new development. See further discussion in “Part I” – “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
  
 If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, including, for example, on federal and American Indian lands, we could incur potentially significant added cost to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.
  
In the event that local or state restrictions or prohibitions are adopted in areas where we conduct operations, that impose more stringent limitations on the production and development of oil and natural gas, including, among other things, the development of increased setback distances, we and similarly situated oil and natural exploration and production operators in the state may incur significant costs to comply with such requirements or may experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and possibly be limited or precluded in the drilling of wells or in the amounts that we and similarly situated operates are ultimately able to produce from our reserves. Any such increased costs, delays, cessations, restrictions or prohibitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, including, for example, on federal and American Indian lands, we could incur potentially significant added cost to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.

 Moreover, because most of our operations are conducted in two particular areas, the Permian Basin in New Mexico and the D-J Basin in Colorado, legal restrictions imposed in that area will have a significantly greater adverse effect than if we had our operations spread out amongst several diverse geographic areas. Consequently, in the event that local or state restrictions or prohibitions are adopted in the Permian Basin in New Mexico and/or the D-J Basin in Colorado that impose more stringent limitations on the production and development of oil and natural gas, we may incur significant costs to comply with such requirements or may experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and possibly be limited or precluded in the drilling of wells or in the amounts that we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves. Any such increased costs, delays, cessations, restrictions or prohibitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
  
  Activities on Federal Lands
  
 Oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities on federal lands, including American Indian lands and lands administered by the BLM, are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the BLM, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an Environmental Assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. While we currently have no exploration, development and production activities on federal lands, our future exploration, development and production activities may include leasing of federal mineral interests, which will require the acquisition of governmental permits or authorizations that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to delay or limit, or increase the cost of, the development of oil and natural gas projects. Authorizations under NEPA are also subject to protest, appeal or litigation, any or all of which may delay or halt projects. Moreover, depending on the mitigation strategies recommended in Environmental Assessments or Environmental Impact Statements, we could incur added costs, which may be substantial.
 Endangered Species and Migratory Birds Considerations
  
 The federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”), and comparable state laws were established to protect endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to the ESA, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species or that species’ habitat. Similar protections are offered to migrating birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. We may conduct operations on oil and natural gas leases in areas where certain species that are listed as threatened or endangered are known to exist and where other species, such as the sage grouse, that potentially could be listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA may exist. Moreover, as a result of one or more agreements entered into by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the agency is required to make a determination on listing of numerous species as endangered or threatened under the ESA pursuant to specific timelines. The identification or designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures, time delays or limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce reserves. If we were to have a portion of our leases designated as critical or suitable habitat, it could adversely impact the value of our leases.
 OSHA
  
 We are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and comparable state statutes and any implementing regulations require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens.
 Related Permits and Authorizations
  
 Many environmental laws require us to obtain permits or other authorizations from state and/or federal agencies before initiating certain drilling, construction, production, operation, or other oil and natural gas activities, and to maintain these permits and compliance with their requirements for on-going operations. These permits are generally subject to protest, appeal, or litigation, which can in certain cases delay or halt projects and cease production or operation of wells, pipelines, and other operations.

 We are not able to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws or regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing, but the direct and indirect costs of such laws and regulations (if enacted) could materially and adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See further discussion in “Part I” – “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
  
  Insurance
  
 Our oil and gas properties are subject to hazards inherent in the oil and gas industry, such as accidents, blowouts, explosions, implosions, fires and oil spills. These conditions can cause:
  
   ●
  damage to or destruction of property, equipment and the environment;

   ●
  personal injury or loss of life; and

   ●
  suspension of operations.

 
 We maintain insurance coverage that we believe to be customary in the industry against these types of hazards. However, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable. In addition, our insurance is subject to coverage limits and some policies exclude coverage for damages resulting from environmental contamination. The occurrence of a significant event or adverse claim in excess of the insurance coverage that we maintain or that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
  
  Employees
  
 At December 31, 2018, we employed 14 people and also utilize the services of independent contractors to perform various field and other services. Our future success will depend partially on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
