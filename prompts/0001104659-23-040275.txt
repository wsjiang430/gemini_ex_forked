Item 1. Business.
Our Company
Annovis Bio, Inc. is a clinical stage, drug platform company addressing neurodegeneration, such as Alzheimer’s disease (“AD”) and Parkinson’s disease (“PD”). We are developing our lead product candidate, Buntanetap, which is designed to address AD, PD, and potentially other chronic neurodegenerative diseases. Buntanetap is a synthetically produced small molecule, orally administered, brain penetrant compound. In several studies, Buntanetap was observed to inhibit the synthesis of neurotoxic proteins—APP/Aβ (“APP”), tau/phospho-tau (“tau”) and α-Synuclein (“αSYN”)—that are one of the main causes of neurodegeneration. High levels of neurotoxic proteins lead to impaired axonal transport, which is responsible for the communication between and within nerve cells. When that communication is impaired, the immune system is activated and attacks the nerve cells, eventually killing them. We have observed in our clinical studies in early AD and early PD patients and pre-clinical studies in mice and rats that Buntanetap lowered neurotoxic protein levels leading to improved axonal transport, reduced inflammation, lower nerve cell death and improved affected function.


In 2021, we completed two Phase 1/2 clinical studies: one in 14 early AD patients, and one in 54 early PD patients (together, the “AD/PD Trials”). In the AD/PD Trials, early AD patients were defined as those with a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score between 19 and 28 and early PD patients as those patients at Hoehn & Yahr stages 1, 2 or 3. MMSE is a brief screening instrument used to assess cognitive function, with total scores ranging from 0 to 30 and a lower score indicating greater disease severity, while the Hoehn & Yahr scale is a medical assessment used to measure staging of the functional disability associated with PD where a higher stage indicates greater disease severity. In collaboration with the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study (“ADCS”), we also conducted a trial in 16 early AD patients (the “ADCS Trial”). In the ADCS Trial, early AD patients were defined as those patients with a MMSE score between 19 and 28. All three clinical trials were double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. We designed the studies by applying our understanding of the underlying neurodegenerative disease states, and measured both target and pathway validation in the spinal fluid of patients to determine whether patients improved following treatment. In addition to meeting their primary endpoints of safety and tolerability and secondary endpoint of pharmacokinetics of Buntanetap, our AD/PD Trials met exploratory endpoints of measures of biomarkers and improvements in cognition in AD patients, and in function in PD patients. We believe that the AD/PD Trials represent the first double-blind placebo-controlled studies that showed improvements in AD patients, as measured by ADAS-Cog, and in PD patients, as measured by UPDRS. Following completion of the AD/PD Trials, we submitted our data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and requested direction to further pursue the development of Buntanetap in early PD patients. With the FDA’s guidance, we initiated a Phase 3 study in early PD patients in August 2022 (our “Phase 3 PD Study”). In the Phase 3 PD Study, early PD patients were defined as those at Hoehn & Yahr stages 1, 2 or 3 and OFF times of less than two hours per day. OFF time refers to when PD motor and/or non-motor symptoms occur between medication doses. We also submitted a proposed protocol for the treatment of moderate AD to the FDA, and after receiving permission to proceed, we initiated a Phase 2/3 study in mild to moderate AD patients in February 2023 (our “Phase 2/3 AD Study”). In the Phase 2/3 AD Study, mild to moderate AD patients were defined as those with a MMSE score between 14 and 24. At the completion of the ADCS Trial, the data showed that Buntanetap is a translational inhibitor in humans just like in animals, and we further observed that there was statistical improvement in cognition in early AD patients, just like in the AD/PD Trials.
Our Phase 3 PD Study and Phase 2/3 AD Study each have built in interim analyses. Our Phase 3 PD Study incorporated an interim analysis at two months, the results of which were disclosed on March 31, 2023. The pre-planned interim analysis was conducted by our data analytics provider based on 132 patients from all cohorts collectively for which baseline and two-month data was available. As the interim analysis was conducted at two months of the six-month endpoint and only on 132 patients, it may not be indicative of the results at six months for the full patient population because as the trial progresses, clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Based on the results of the interim analysis, we intend to proceed with the Phase 3 PD Study as planned in accordance with the previously established protocol. We remain blinded to the Phase 3 PD Study and we do not have safety or efficacy data from the trial. A separate safety interim analysis is in process and we expect that interim analysis to be released in the second quarter of 2023. We intend to disclose the results of an interim analysis for our Phase 

6



2/3 AD Study in Fall 2023. We plan to consult with the FDA following completion of these interim analyses, to obtain feedback on our ongoing and planned AD and PD studies, including conducting an open label extension study following the completion of the initial trials. Using the data from the Phase 3 PD Study interim analysis, we intend to design an 18-month long disease-modifying Phase 3 study in the same early PD patients. In addition, we intend to conduct a short 6-month study in advanced PD patients during the second half of the 18-month disease modifying Phase 3 study, at which time we will define the advanced PD patient population for the purposes of such study. Similarly, using the data from the Phase 2/3 AD Study interim analysis, we intend to design an 18-month disease modifying Phase 3 study in the same early AD patient population. In addition, we intend to conduct a short 6-month study in advanced AD patients during the second half of the 18-month disease modifying Phase 3 study, at which time we will define the advanced AD patient population for the purposes of such study. We expect both the ongoing Phase 3 PD Study and the Phase 2/3 AD Study to be completed by the end of 2023, and we intend to announce the data from the final analyses in the first quarter of 2024.
By the end of 2026, our goal is to have conducted the required pivotal studies for Buntanetap to be able to file two new drug applications (“NDAs”) with the FDA.
We believe that we are the only company developing a drug for AD and PD that is designed to inhibit more than one neurotoxic protein, and has a mechanism of action designed to restore nerve cell axonal and synaptic activity. By improving brain function, our goal is to treat memory loss and dementia associated with AD as well as body and brain function associated with PD. Based on pre-clinical and clinical data collected to date, we believe that Buntanetap has the potential to be the first drug to interfere with the underlying mechanism of neurodegeneration, potentially enabling Buntanetap to be the only drug to improve cognition in AD and motor function in PD. The industry has encountered challenges in specifically targeting one neurotoxic protein, be it APP, tau or αSYN, indicating that doing so does not change the course of neurodegeneration. Our goal is to develop a disease modifying drug (“DMD”) for patients with neurodegeneration by leveraging our clinical and pre-clinical data to inhibit the three most relevant neurotoxic proteins. Studies have found that AD and PD are the most common neurodegenerative diseases in the U.S., and accordingly these diseases present two unmet needs of the aging population and two potentially large U.S. markets if a DMD is developed and approved.

Mechanism of Action
Our lead product candidate, Buntanetap, is designed as an oral translational inhibitor of neurotoxic aggregating proteins (“TINAP”) such as APP, tau and αSYN. To understand how Buntanetap can potentially inhibit translation, we undertook two 

7



complementary approaches: a macro approach to examine all proteins in the cell whose translation is affected by Buntanetap, and a micro approach to study the mechanism of action using molecular biology, to understand and validate the binding and function.
First, the non-biased proteomics approach was applied to explore what proteins in the total protein universe were specifically downregulated by Buntanetap. We have observed that, in addition to the proteins already known to be reduced by Buntanetap, other neurotoxic aggregating proteins - huntingtin protein (“HTT”) and TDP43 - were downregulated as well.
A detailed analysis of the reduction of these protein levels was conducted in five different laboratories using multiple methodologies. The results observed in the analysis revealed that the mRNAs of these proteins have a special region, an atypical stem loop, that is preserved and responsible for their translation. When this region is bound to an RNA binding protein, the mRNA is not translated. When this region is free, the mRNA is translated. In neurodegenerative conditions, the mRNA coding for these neurotoxic proteins is over-translated, produces high levels of these proteins and causes them to become toxic. Buntanetap was observed to specifically increase the affinity between this special region and the RNA binding protein, thereby showing the potential to prevent the mRNA from being released and translated. 
This leads to lower translation, lower levels of neurotoxic proteins, and less toxicity in the brain. By preventing the overexpression of these neurotoxic proteins, Buntanetap is designed to reverse the downstream toxic cascade that leads to neurodegeneration and reinstates homeostasis. 
This rigorous approach to understanding the mode of action shows that while Buntanetap does lower the levels of more than one neurotoxic protein, it is exquisitely specific for the atypical stem loops in the mRNAs of these proteins.
The following illustration shows the mechanism of action of Buntanetap:

MOA; Chen XQ et al. Pharmaceutics 09-2021 Iron and Neurodegeneration; Wong f. et al. Frontiers Aging Neuroscience; 03-2022
The special region in the mRNA is a 5’UTR iron responsive element (“IRE”) present in all mRNAs of neurotoxic aggregating proteins. The RNA binding protein is the Iron Regulatory Protein -1 (“IRP1”) that specifically binds the IREs of neurotoxic aggregating proteins.

The Toxic Cascade Leading to Nerve Cell Death and Loss of Function
The toxic cascade in neurodegeneration begins with high levels of neurotoxic proteins which lead to impaired axonal transport, inflammation, death of nerve cells and loss of cognition and motor function. Buntanetap and ANVS405, our product candidates designed to treat acute neurodegeneration, including traumatic brain injury (“TBI”), have a mechanism of action we believe to be unique. The mechanism of action is designed to inhibit the over-translation of and reduce the levels of APP, tau and αSYN, which play a central role in the pathogenesis of both AD and PD. This leads us to believe that Buntanetap has the potential to be a promising drug for the treatment of both AD and PD. Our approach is innovative in that we do not have a single therapeutic target for a single disease; instead, we are developing a technology platform that has the potential to target the mRNAs of multiple neurotoxic proteins, which are potentially impactful for multiple diseases.

In our AD/PD Trials, we observed that Buntanetap reduced levels of neurotoxic proteins, improved axonal transport and synaptic function, reduced inflammation, improved the health of nerve cells and improved cognition and function in mild to moderate AD and PD patients.
We have observed that Buntanetap reduced the levels of multiple neurotoxic proteins in animals and reversed the toxic cascade. In addition, Buntanetap was observed to reverse the entire toxic cascade in animals and recover function, be it in the brain, the body, or the eyes.

Pipeline
Our pipeline consists of: Buntanetap for chronic neurodegeneration - including AD and PD; ANVS405 for acute neurodegeneration; and ANVS301 for advanced AD.


Buntanetap
Our lead product candidate, Buntanetap, is an orally administered drug being developed for chronic indications such as AD and PD, and it has been observed to improve axonal transport in these diseases in preclinical studies by inhibiting the overproduction of neurotoxic proteins that kill nerve cells. Buntanetap further demonstrated improvements of cognition, including memory and learning, in AD mice and movement, including colonic motility and grip strength, in PD mice. Buntanetap was tested in three Phase 1 clinical studies that showed it to be well tolerated. This safety data is applicable to the clinical development of Buntanetap for AD, PD, and potentially other chronic neurodegenerative diseases. We have completed three Phase 1/2 clinical trials for Buntanetap. We are presently treating PD patients in our Phase 3 PD Study and AD patients in our Phase 2/3 AD Study.
We believe that Buntanetap has the potential to be the only drug to improve both cognition in AD patients, and motor function in PD patients. Additionally, Buntanetap was observed to protect nerve cells from dying in the brain of traumatic brain injury mice and to protect nerve cells from dying in the eye of glaucoma rats.
ANVS405
ANVS405 is an intravenous drug being developed for acute indications, and focused on protecting the brain after TBI and/or stroke. ANVS405 is the same compound as Buntanetap, given in cases of acute head and brain trauma. ANVS405 was given to rats intravenously after TBI to determine whether ANVS405 would reach the brain in less than 15 minutes, as opposed to 1.5 hours if given orally. TBI rats that were treated with ANVS405 after the insult exhibited enhanced memory and learning and lower microglia activation, a measure of inflammation. The program has been funded by a grant from the U.S. Army which has been completed, and we plan to seek additional grant funding to further the development of ANVS405 for acute indications of brain and nerve trauma. If and when we receive such sufficient funding, we plan to conduct a follow-on study to evaluate the effect of ANVS405 administered to TBI rats at various intervals post-injury to determine how long after a TBI we can effectively treat a patient. Our plan is to seek further funding to conduct the toxicology and pharmacokinetics (“PK”) studies in animals, file the initial new drug application (“IND”), conduct the safety and PK studies in humans and continue with Phase 2 and Phase 3 efficacy studies.

10



ANVS301
ANVS301 is an orally administered drug being developed to increase cognitive capability in later stages of AD and dementia. ANVS301 was observed to improve memory and learning in very old rats by lowering the number of errors from six to three and shortening run times from approximately 75 to approximately 28 seconds. ANVS301 is in a Phase 1 clinical trial that was conducted and financed by the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”). The single ascending dose study has been completed, and we expect to evaluate the continued development of ANVS301 based upon funding availability. When both the single and multiple ascending dose safety studies are complete, we will review the data and decide whether to pursue the indication of advanced AD.
Clinical Trials of Buntanetap
Development Plan for Alzheimer’s Disease
The development of Buntanetap for AD is expected to include a short study for moderate AD showing symptomatic efficacy, a long 18-month study in early AD showing disease-modifying efficacy, and a second short 6-month study in advanced AD. We expect to discuss the development plan with the FDA following receipt of the results from the interim analysis of the first study in Fall 2023.
In February 2023, we initiated the first of the three studies: a Phase 2/3 clinical trial of Buntanetap in 320 mild to moderate AD patients, which were separated into four cohorts of 80 patients (the “Phase 2/3 AD Trial”). The Phase 2/3 AD Trial is expected to be conducted at approximately 80 sites in the U.S. The Phase 2/3 AD Trial is a double-blind placebo-controlled efficacy study which treats mild to moderate AD. The inclusion criteria for mild to moderate AD is a MMSE score of 14 to 24. Patients participating in the trial are age 55-85, have a study partner, are of non-child-bearing age or agree to effective contraception, and have no evidence of suicidal ideation. Patients participating in the trial can remain on any drugs they regularly take, whether for AD or for other conditions, as long as they are stable on such medication. Patients with uncontrolled diabetes, cardiovascular issues or seizures, patients with clinically significant abnormal laboratory values, patients with cancer within the last year and patients suffering from alcohol or substance abuse are excluded from participating.
Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either 7.5, 15 or 30 mg of Buntanetap or placebo once per day. Patients will visit the clinic for the first-time dosing in clinic, followed by an at home dosing period of 12 weeks. The study plan incorporates an interim analysis at six-weeks, the results of which are expected in Fall 2023. The Phase 2/3 AD Trial is designed to assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK of Buntanetap. The co-primary endpoints of the Phase 2/3 AD Trial are evaluated using the following measures: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 11 (ADAScog 11), which measures cognitive functions and non-cognitive functions such as mood and behavior; and ADCS-Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC), which focuses on clinicians' observations of change in the patient's cognitive, functional, and behavioral performance since the beginning of a trial. The FDA requested to include two co-primary endpoints to have an objective primary endpoint (ADAScog, cognition) and a subjective primary endpoint (ADCS-CGIC, activities of daily living). Together, these co-primary endpoints are intended to provide in a more complete picture of the study and treatment results. The secondary endpoints are evaluated using the following measures: the ADCS-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADCS-ADL), which measures 6 basic activities of daily living items, including basic self-care tasks such as feeding, mobility and bathing, and 17 instrumental activities of daily living items, which include a broad range of activities based on cultural norms and gender roles; MMSE; and the digital symbol substitution test (DSST), which asks individuals to record associations between different symbols and numbers within time limits to assess cognition.
The second trial we intend to conduct is an 18-month disease-modifying Phase 3 study in early AD patients, in which patients will be randomly assigned to receive either placebo or a dose of Buntanetap once per day, to be determined based upon the results of the Phase 2/3 AD Trial. 
The third trial we intend to conduct is a six-month study in advanced AD patients, which is expected to take place during the second half of the 18-month disease modifying Phase 3 study. In this six-month study, patients will be randomly assigned to receive either placebo or a dose of Buntanetap once per day, to be determined based upon the results of the Phase 2/3 AD Trial.

Development for Parkinson’s Disease
The development plan of Buntanetap for PD is expected to include a short study for early PD patients showing symptomatic efficacy, a long 18-month study in the same patient population showing disease-modifying efficacy, and a second short 6-month study in advanced PD.
In August 2022, we initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial of Buntanetap in 450 early PD patients, which were separated into three cohorts of 150 patients (the “Phase 3 PD Trial”). The Phase 3 PD Trial is expected to be conducted at approximately 53 sites in the U.S. and 49 sites in the EU. The Phase 3 PD Trial is a double-blind placebo-controlled efficacy study which treats early PD. The inclusion criteria for early PD are Hoehn & Yahr 1, 2 and 3 with less than 2 hours of OFF time, as well as a MMSE score of 22 to 30. Patients participating in the trial are age 40-85, are of non-child-bearing age or agree to effective contraception, and have no evidence of suicidal ideation. Patients participating in the trial can remain on any drugs they regularly take, whether for PD or for other conditions, as long as they are stable on such medication. Patients with uncontrolled diabetes, cardiovascular issues or seizures, patients with clinically significant abnormal laboratory values, patients with cancer within the last year and patients suffering from alcohol or substance abuse are excluded from the trial. Patients are randomly assigned to receive either 10 or 20 mg of Buntanetap or placebo once per day. Patients visit the clinic for the first-time dosing in clinic, followed by an at home dosing period of 6 months. The study plan incorporated an interim analysis at two months, the results of which were disclosed by the Company on March 31, 2023. The pre-planned interim analysis was conducted by our data analytics provider based on 132 patients from all cohorts collectively for which baseline and two-month data was available. As the interim analysis was conducted at two months of the six-month endpoint and only on 132 patients, it may not be indicative of the results at six months for the full patient population because as the trial progresses, clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Based on the results of the interim analysis, we intend to proceed with the Phase 3 PD Study as planned in accordance with the previously established protocol. We remain blinded to the Phase 3 PD Study and we do not have safety or efficacy data from the trial. A separate safety interim analysis is in process and we expect that interim analysis to be released in the second quarter of 2023. The study is designed to assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK of Buntanetap. The Phase 3 PD Trial’s primary endpoints are evaluated using the following measures: the MDS-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part II and III, which is a 42-item rating scale designed to assess Parkinson's disease-related disability and impairment, and evaluates activities of daily living and motor function; and safety and tolerability, which is assessed using physical examinations, vital signs, clinical laboratory test results, 

12



electrocardiogram findings, adverse events (AEs) leading to study discontinuation, drug related AEs, severity of AEs and AEs. Specifically, The FDA requested two co-primary endpoints to have an objective primary endpoint (MDS-UPDRS Part III, motor function) and a subjective primary endpoint (MDS-UPDRS Part II, activities of daily living). Together, these co-primary endpoints are intended to provide in a more complete picture of the study and treatment results. The secondary endpoints are evaluated using the following measures: the MDS-UPDRS total score, which includes the Part II and III measures we well as mentation, behavior, and mood symptoms, and complications of dopaminergic therapy; the participant global impression of change (PGIC), a participant-reported outcome which asks how their condition has changed compared to their condition at the beginning of treatment; and the Change on Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGIS), which measures the severity of movement impairment as assessed by the site rater.
The second trial we intend to conduct is an 18-month disease-modifying Phase 3 study in early PD patients, in which patients will be randomly assigned to receive either placebo or a dose of Buntanetap once per day, to be determined based upon the results of the Phase 3 PD Trial. 
The third study we intend to conduct is a six-month study in advanced PD patients, which is expected to take place during the second half of the 18-month disease modifying Phase 3 study. In this six-month study, patients will be randomly assigned to receive either placebo or a dose of Buntanetap once per day, to be determined based upon the results of the Phase 3 PD Trial.

Phase 1/2 AD/PD Trials
In 2021, we completed a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of Buntanetap in 14 early AD and 54 early PD patients (the “AD/PD Trials”) which were conducted at 12 sites in the U.S. The AD/PD Trials were double-blind placebo-controlled studies which treated mild to moderate AD and early PD patients for 25 +/- 2 days. The inclusion criteria for the AD portion of the AD/PD Trials were MMSE 18-28 and age 45 and older and for the PD portion of the AD/PD Trials were MMSE 18-30, age 45 and older and Hoehn & Yahr 1, 2 or 3. Patients participating in the trial were of non-child-bearing age or agreed to effective contraception, and had no evidence of suicidal ideation. Patients participating in the trial could remain on any drugs they regularly take, whether for PD, for AD or for other conditions, as long as they were stable on such medication. Patients with uncontrolled diabetes, cardiovascular issues or seizures, patients with clinically significant abnormal laboratory values, patients who had cancer within the prior year and patients who suffered from alcohol or substance abuse were excluded from the trial.

13



The AD/PD Trials were designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of Buntanetap. The studies met their primary endpoints of safety and tolerability, as measured by the percentage of patients with treatment-emergent adverse events in the Buntanetap treatment arms as compared to the placebo groups, and secondary endpoint of pharmacokinetics of Buntanetap, as measured by the concentration of Buntanetap in plasma. The studies also met exploratory endpoints of measures of biomarkers related to neurotoxic protein cascade, and improvements in cognition in AD patients and function in PD patients. We believe the AD/PD Trials were the first double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that showed improvements in AD patients as measured by ADAS-Cog, and in PD patients as measured in UPDRS.
The studies were conducted in two parts. The first part of the AD/PD Trials was in 14 early AD patients and 14 early PD patients. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 80 mg of Buntanetap or placebo once per day. The second part of the AD/PD Trials was a dose response analysis in 40 early PD patients in which patients were randomly assigned to receive 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg of Buntanetap once per day. In both parts of the AD/PD Trials, patients visited the clinic for the first-time dosing in clinic, followed by an at home dosing period of 25 +/- 2 days. We measured levels of neurotoxic proteins, neurotransmitters, neurotrophic factors, inflammation, and nerve cell death in all patients, as well as cognitive and functional improvements.
Safety and PK
Safety results show that Buntanetap was well-tolerated in all dose groups. No serious adverse events were reported. The adverse events seen included problems related to CNS sampling: headaches, back and leg pain. PK parameters for Buntanetap in plasma of AD and PD patients were similar to those seen in Phase 1 in our single ascending dose (“SAD”) and multiple ascending dose (“MAD”) studies in healthy volunteers, and in a proof-of-concept study in mild-cognitive impaired (“MCI”) patients.
Reduction of Neurotoxic Proteins
We observed that Buntanetap administration for 25 days lowered secreted APP α and β as well as total-tau and phosphorylated-tau levels in AD patients, and alpha-synuclein levels in PD patients. APP and its downstream products and tau are the neurotoxic proteins involved in AD, while αSYN is the primary neurotoxic culprit of PD.
Changes in Biomarkers After 25 Days Treatment with Buntanetap

* All values are in comparison to placebo based on all data points.
Cerebrospinal fluid (“CSF”) was extracted before starting the study at baseline and at time 0 to 6 hours at the end of the study in both placebo and Buntanetap treated patients. The values from time 0 to 6 hours were pooled to lower variability and the placebo values were deducted from the treated values. In all but one case, Ab42, we saw that the levels in Buntanetap treated patients were lower than in placebo patients. With respect to Ab42, we observed that levels were slightly higher, which is consistent with our hypothesis that Ab42 levels are lower in advanced AD and higher in early AD. We believe that higher Ab42 levels we observed suggest that the course of AD was reversed and the patients improved.

14



Inflammation
We observed that Buntanetap reduced inflammation in both AD and PD patients, shown by Complement C3, YKL-40, GFAP and sTREM2.

Changes in Inflammatory Markers after 25 Days Treatment with Buntanetap

*All values are in comparison to placebo based on all data points.
Again, CSF was extracted at baseline and for 6 hours after the study and the values of the placebo patients were subtracted from the Buntanetap treated patients. We observed that inflammatory markers were generally reduced in both patient populations.
Axonal and Synaptic Function
We observed that Buntanetap reduced neurofilament light (“NFL”) levels in both AD and PD patients, suggesting a potential improvement in axonal integrity. We also observed that Buntanetap reduced neurogranin (“NG”) levels in both AD and PD, potentially suggesting more intact synaptic functions.
Changes in Synaptic Markers after 25 Days Treatment with Buntanetap

*All values are in comparison to placebo based on all data points.

15



The same CSF as above was used to measure neurofilament light and neurogranin before and after treatment and to compare Buntanetap patients to placebo. In both patient populations neurofilament light and neurogranin are lower in treated than in placebo patients.
We believe these results suggest that Buntanetap has the potential to reduce neurotoxic proteins, rescue axonal transport, reduce inflammation, and protect synaptic functions.
Cognition in AD Patients
We performed ADAS-Cogs and WAIS coding tests to evaluate Buntanetap’s effects on AD patients’ cognition.

* P<0.05
ADAS-Cog11 was performed at the beginning of the study at baseline and at the end at 25 days in the Buntanetap-treated and the placebo groups. Although the study was not powered for efficacy, ADAS-Cog11 improved by 4.4 points, a statistically significant improvement of 28.57%. A result is considered to be statistically significant when the probability of the result occurring by random chance, rather than from the efficacy of the treatment, is sufficiently low. The conventional method for determining the statistical significance of a result is known as the “p-value,” which represents the probability that random chance caused the result (e.g., a p=0.01 means that there is a 1% probability that the difference between the control group and the treatment group is purely due to random chance). Generally, a p-value less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant. An improvement in ADAS-Cog11, which is reflected by a lower ADAS-Cog11 result, indicates increased cognitive performance. At 25 days, the treated group’s improvement from baseline was 3.3 points, or 20.71%, better than the placebo group’s improvement from baseline.

16



* P<0.05
The WAIS coding test measures speed in movement and thinking. Treated AD patients showed a 6.6 point, or 16.17%, statistically significant improvement from baseline. Furthermore, the treated group’s improvement from baseline was 3.1 points, or 8.8%, better than the placebo group’s improvement from baseline.
Motor Function in PD Patients
In Parkinson’s disease, we pooled the original 14 PD patients with the additional 40 PD patients, and looked at the MDS-UPDRS and WAIS coding tests to evaluate Buntanetap’s effects on PD patients’ mobility and functionality. We the 54 PD patients received doses of either 5mg, 10mg, 20mg, 40mg or 80mg Buntanetap treatment or placebo once per day. We observed a statistically significant improvement in Part II, III and IV individually. Specifically, Part III of the MDS-UPDRS measures the motor functions and has long been used as a standard to assess drugs’ effects on patients’ mobility.

We combined the two best doses, 10 and 20 mgs, and all doses, and saw an improvement of 3.6 (16.4%) for 10 and 20 mg, and of 2.4 (13.3%) for all doses combined compared to baseline.

In the WAIS coding test, PD patients show a statistically significant improvement both from baseline (17.1% for 10+20mg; 13.3% for all doses combined) and from placebo (27.1% for 10+20mg; 23.3% for all doses combined).
Phase 1/2 ADCS Trial
We also completed a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1/2 study in early AD patients in conjunction with the ADCS. We treated patients for four weeks with Buntanetap and measured target and pathway engagement in the spinal fluid. This means that we measured levels of neurotoxic proteins, neurotransmitters, neurotrophic factors, inflammation and nerve cell death as well as cognitive improvement. Since Buntanetap is designed as a translation inhibitor, we also measured the rate of synthesis and degradation of Aβ (SILK – stable isotope labeling kinetic study) to determine if our drug changes the speed of translation. Under an agreement with the University of California San Diego, where ADCS is located, we contracted to provide study supplies and PK analysis at our cost but the remaining costs of the ADCS Trial are paid for by the NIH. The study ended after 16 patients were enrolled and treated. Patients participating in the study were of non-child-bearing age or agreed to effective contraception and had no evidence of suicidal ideation. Patients participating in the study could remain on any drugs they regularly take, either for AD or for other conditions, as long as they were stable on such medication. Patients with uncontrolled diabetes, cardiovascular issues or seizures, patients with clinically significant abnormal laboratory values, patients who had cancer within the prior year and patients who suffered from alcohol or substance abuse were excluded from the study. The study was conducted at six sites in the U.S., including the University of California San Diego, Johns Hopkins, Indiana University, Washington University, Cleveland Clinic, and Columbia University. While only 16 patients were treated in total, based on the SILK data, we observed that Buntanetap has the potential to slow the translation of APP/Abeta, leading to overall lower levels and lower overall synthesis of the neurotoxic protein. The Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale –Cognitive Subscale (ADAScog) of the treated patients demonstrated what we observed in our small AD/PD study – statistical improvement in cognition at one month of treatment.
Phase 1 Studies 
Three phase 1 clinical studies have been completed with Buntanetap. Clinical studies with single and repeated daily oral administration of Buntanetap, showed Buntanetap to be well tolerated up to doses of 80 mg once a day or 60 mg four times a day. A single dose of 160 mg was associated with an increased incidence of nausea and vomiting; therefore, higher doses were not tested. Buntanetap is not an AChE inhibitor, but its N1 dimethyl metabolite has some AChE inhibitor activity and may be responsible for these observations. The only consistent AEs seen were dizziness/fainting and headaches. These effects were seen to varying degrees at all doses of Buntanetap and in the placebo group. There were no serious AEs in any of the clinical studies. In the repeat dose studies, 

18



treatment with 60 mg four times a day was not associated with any side effects not also seen in placebo. The adverse events seen included nausea, vomiting and dizziness.
Proof-of-Concept Study in Humans
In the human proof-of-concept (“POC”) study, four patients with MCI were treated for 10 days with Buntanetap with a dose of 60 mg four times a day (240 mg/day), which we observed in a previous safety study to be a well-tolerated level. CSF and plasma were drawn over 12 hours on Day 0 before any administration of Buntanetap and on Day 11 after the last administration of Buntanetap. During each 12-hour period, a total of nine CSF samples were taken and levels of Buntanetap and metabolites were measured in plasma and CSF at all time points. The human POC study was discontinued prior to completion as a cost saving measure.
Pharmacokinetics
Buntanetap’s PK in plasma corresponded to what we had seen in the previous clinical safety studies: a half-life of five hours. In CSF, however, Buntanetap showed a much longer half-life of over 12 hours. We conducted an identical experiment in rats, where it is possible to measure the PK of Buntanetap in plasma, CSF and brain. By taking the human plasma/CSF and rat plasma/CSF/brain levels, we were able to extrapolate to the human brain levels and calculate them to be eight times higher than plasma levels. This is generally consistent with the data we have in mice, where in several studies, Buntanetap levels were found to be approximately six to eight times higher in brain than in plasma.
Buntanetap’s extended presence in the brain is matched by an extended effect, reducing levels of APP, tau and αSYN for the whole 12-hour period tested. The extended effect of Buntanetap in the four human patients was generally consistent with the preclinical data in rodent brains.
We believe the persistence of Buntanetap in the CSF and brain and the extended pharmacodynamic effect observed has the potential to make Buntanetap a good candidate for once-a-day dosing. Extrapolated brain levels of Buntanetap at 60 mg four times a day were far in excess of levels we believe are required to down-regulate APP and αSYN. The doses of Buntanetap needed to lower the levels of neurotoxic proteins are similar for the toxic proteins, suggesting similar dosing in AD and PD. We further compared Buntanetap brain levels of mice that showed improved memory, learning and colonic motility and estimated that the optimum brain levels measured were between 150 and 500 nM. Using three different extrapolation/comparison calculations we estimated that a daily dose of 5 mg to 25 mg may be able to achieve potentially desired brain levels in humans.
Pharmacodynamics
Buntanetap pharmacodynamics was performed on the same 18 CSF samples taken from each person as above. Since we had data for four patients with 18 time points each, it was possible to conduct statistical analysis of the data using a repeated measure mixed model analysis of variance. The p-value represents the probability that the difference between compared groups is due to chance rather than drug effect, and when that probability is less than 5%, or p<0.05, the result is considered statistically significant. FDA evidentiary standards for drug approval require that the trial design must permit a valid comparison with a control group to permit a quantitative assessment of the effect of the drug, which may include demonstration of statistical significance.

Comparison with Healthy Volunteers
We also compared the levels found in four healthy volunteers with the levels seen in the four MCI patients before and after 10 days of Buntanetap administration. The heathy volunteers did not go through the entire study as did the MCI patients. They gave one CSF sample taken by lumbar puncture in the morning and that sample was only used to measure sAPPα, sAPPβ and tau.
We used a single measurement from the same time point in each of the mornings of Day 0 and Day 11 for each MCI patient because this was similar to the timing for the healthy volunteers. In this very limited comparison, we were able to show that all four patients experienced a decrease in sAPPα, sAPPβ and tau. These reductions brought the average levels of sAPPα, sAPPβ and tau in the treated MCI patients close to the average levels we measured in healthy volunteers.
We used the same 18 samples collected from the CSF of the mildly cognitive impaired patients and measured four inflammatory factors and one control factor. In accordance with our hypothesis the levels of inflammatory markers were significantly 

19



reduced. We also measured Factor FH, a complement regulatory protein, as our control factor. As we had expected, Factor FH was not downregulated by Buntanetap.
Axonal Transport in Human Nerve Cells
When the information highway of a nerve cell slows down, the nerve cell is unable to properly communicate with other nerve cells, internal organs and the periphery and it gets sick and dies.
The transfer of information in a nerve cell is called axonal transport and when transport and synaptic transmission are impaired, the cell releases lower levels of neurotransmitters, leading to impaired nerve cell health. The diseased cell is then attacked by the immune system, which is activated when it detects a diseased cell, and it eventually kills the cell. Impairment in axonal transport, therefore, leads to inflammation and eventually to nerve cell death.

Preclinical Animal Studies 
By inhibiting the overexpression of neurotoxic proteins, Buntanetap improved or prevented the symptoms associated with chronic as well as acute neurodegeneration in several animal models. 
APP/PS1 Transgenic Mouse Model of AD
APP/PS1 AD transgenic (“tg”) mice were treated for one month with Buntanetap, before behavioral evaluation. Buntanetap was observed improving spatial-working memory in a 2-day radial arm water maze test in this mouse AD model at a 25 mg/kg oral dose and showing a dose response at 10 mg/kg oral dose. In the same study, Buntanetap was observed improving synaptic function and long-term potentiation in hippocampal slices at both doses in a dose-dependent fashion. Buntanetap treatment did not affect wild-type mice.
Trisomic Mouse Model of AD-DS
DS trisomic mice display several abnormal behaviors reminiscent of AD, including memory loss. They have elevated levels of APP that has been shown in mice to contribute to deficient memory and learning, cognitive impairment as well as dementia. DS trisomic mice are used as a model for AD, because they exhibit similar deficits as seen in AD. Thus, we considered whether 

20



Buntanetap could re-establish healthy behavior in these mice like that seen in wild-type mice. We measured the rate of spontaneous alternations in a Y-maze and found that the alternation rate is significantly lower in DS trisomic mice versus wild-type mice reflecting impaired working memory. While Buntanetap treatment increased alternation rate in DS trisomic mice it had no obvious effects in wild-type mice. We also found an effect on the exploratory activity reflected by the number of arm entries, again reflecting impaired working memory. All DS trisomic mice treated with Buntanetap displayed improved working memory to a variable extent. 
SNCAA53T and SNCAA30P Mouse Models of PD
We used these PD tg mice as models of early gastrointestinal dysfunction, which is common in PD patients and precedes the onset of motor symptoms by many years to decades. Untreated PD tg mice resemble pre-Parkinson’s patients, showing symptoms of constipation by three months of age. Here we assessed the colonic motility by measuring the time required to expel a glass bead inserted into the colon at four and seven months of age. Buntanetap statistically significantly (p=0.034 at four months and p=0.0001 at seven months) decreased the bead expulsion time between Buntanetap treated and placebo treated mice; thus, it improved the colonic motility of PD tg mice. Furthermore, even after we stopped treatment for nine weeks, the constipation was still reduced. 
TBI in Rats
TBI causes severe cognitive and neurological impairment, which can incapacitate the patient, reduce quality of life, and increase the risk of morbidity and mortality. TBI is known to increase the risk for neurodegenerative disorders such as AD and PD. Several studies have analyzed changes in the brain after TBI and identified up-regulation of neurotoxic proteins, such as APP, tau, and αSYN.
In our study (manuscript in preparation), rats were subjected to either fluid percussion injury (“FPI”) or sham operation to one side of the brain. Three different ANVS405 doses or saline were given intraperitoneally to rats subjected to FPI for four weeks, with the first dose administered one hour post-injury. At the termination of the treatment, all the rats were first tested for their performance in the water maze, and then they were sacrificed for brain staining of living cells and determination of microglia activation. 10 mg/kg ANVS405 improved memory and learning as measured by water maze performance. Furthermore, sections of the brain were stained with tyrosine hydroxylase (“TH”), wherein TH stains only live cells. The amounts of TH immunoreactivity in the whole striatum of the brain slices were measured. The rats treated with all three doses of ANVS405 showed higher TH staining in the ipsilateral area of the brain than the vehicle treated animals. Thus, ANVS405 protects the striatum following FPI in rats. 
Because FPI can induce microglial activation, we next checked whether ANVS405 would reverse this pathology. In our study, we found that ANVS405 increased the number of resting microglia and reduced the number of activated microglia.
Stroke Mice
Buntanetap was tested in a stroke model, in which mice were challenged with MCAo-induced stroke (middle carotid artery occlusion induced stoke) and after four weeks, the number of surviving neurons was quantified. After four weeks the locomotor function, behavior, and cognition of these mice were also evaluated.
Buntanetap in combination with pifithrin-α (PFT-α) given to mice after the induced stroke improved mice locomotor activity and cognitive function. While both treatments yielded improvements in locomotor and cognitive function, the combined Buntanetap/PFT-α treatment proved able to enhance stroke-induced endogenous neurogenesis and improve the functional recovery in stroke animals. The combined treatment also significantly improved cognitive function more than the single treatment with PFT-α 
Markets
With there being a very large potential market for neurodegenerative diseases, most pharma companies have a program studying some aspect of nerve and brain degeneration. Some newer approaches target tau, whose expression is more closely associated with cognitive decline. Similarly, for PD, several companies are trying to inhibit αSYN. So far, we believe that neither drugs attacking tau nor αSYN have shown positive results. Hence there is a substantial need for a different disease-modifying strategy. There is more than one neurotoxic protein in the brain of AD and of PD patients, and the same neurotoxic proteins are involved in the pathogenesis of AD and PD. A significant portion of AD patients’ brains display mixed PD pathology and vice versa. Therefore, just attacking one 

21



of these proteins may result in no or lower efficacy than attacking them all. To prove that this approach is possible, we are studying the effects of Buntanetap on the levels of several neurotoxic proteins and other surrogate markers, in parallel, in AD and PD patients.
Alzheimer’s Disease Market
AD is a neurodegenerative disorder with cognitive, functional, and behavioral alterations. AD is age related, and its incidence is increasing with the aging of the population. It is estimated that currently 44 million victims of AD dementia exist in the world and by 2050, more than 100 million people worldwide will be living with AD. In the United States, it is estimated that there are six million patients with AD. Nearly eightfold as many people have preclinical AD as have symptomatic AD and are at risk for progressing to manifest disease. Disease modifying treatments (“DMTs“) that will prevent or delay the onset or slow the progression of AD are urgently needed. Similarly, medications to effectively improve cognition or ameliorate neuropsychiatric symptoms of patients in the symptomatic phases of AD are needed to improve memory and behavior.
The incidence rate of AD increases significantly with age. Individuals between ages 64 to 75 have an incidence rate of 0.4%, which increases to 3.2% for people between ages 75 and 84 and finally to 7.6% for people aged 85 and above. These incidence rates are cumulative as an individual ages, which means that an individual reaching 90 years of age will have a 38% chance of suffering from AD while an individual reaching the age of 95 will have a 76% chance of suffering from AD. AD is becoming increasingly common as the global population ages and as the health systems in developing countries improve. There is a significant need to identify drugs that prevent, delay the onset, slow the progression, or improve the symptoms of AD.
Parkinson’s Disease Market
PD is also a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with movement and non-movement symptoms, functional, behavioral and cognitive alterations. PD, like AD, is age related and is becoming markedly more common with the aging of the world’s population. PD affects about 1% of the population over the age of 60, while in individuals over the age of 85, this prevalence reaches 5%, highlighting the impact that advancing age has on the risk of developing this condition.
PD affects about 10 million people worldwide, of which nearly one million are in the U.S. While a 2014 study estimated that the incidence in the U.S. will rise to 1.2 million by 2030, a later 2022 study found that there are nearly 90,000 new cases of PD diagnosed each year in the U.S., potentially supporting an even greater future incidence rate.
The National Parkinson’s Foundation estimates that the economic burden of PD is at least $25 billion a year in the United States.
To date, there are no available treatments capable of curing PD, with current therapies seeking only to ameliorate dopamine-related motor symptoms of the disease. There is a clear and unmet medical need for new DMTs that can slow or prevent PD progression.
Mixed Pathologies Market
In addition to the unmet need of AD and PD patients, approximately 50% of patients exhibit mixed pathologies, with some pathologies resembling AD and some resembling PD.
Dementia is increasingly being recognized in cases of PD; such cases are termed PD dementia (“PDD”). The spread of fibrillar αSYN pathology from the brainstem to limbic and neocortical structures seems to be the strongest neuropathological correlate of emerging dementia in PD. Up to 50% of patients with PDD develop sufficient numbers of Aβ plaques and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles for a secondary diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease, and these pathologies may act synergistically with αSYN pathology to confer a worse prognosis.
Another study looking at the incidence of mixed pathologies diagnosed community-dwelling older persons. Those with dementia most often have multiple brain pathologies, which greatly increases the odds of dementia. Specifically, in people with 

22



dementia, over 50% had multiple diagnoses (AD, PD/Lewy body dementia, PDD or infarcts). After accounting for age, persons with multiple diagnoses were almost three times more likely to exhibit dementia compared to those with one pathologic diagnosis.
We believe that a therapy that only addresses Aβ, tau or αSYN is less likely to help people with mixed pathologies. Since Buntanetap is designed to inhibit more than one neurotoxic protein, we believe that it may have the potential to slow or eventually stop AD, PD and mixed pathology diseases.
Approaches and Competition
Alzheimer’s Disease Approaches
Drug development for AD has proven to be very difficult. Drugs which have been approved for the treatment of AD include cholinesterase inhibitors (tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine) and an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist (memantine). Many failures in AD drug development have occurred, with both small molecules and immunotherapies failing to show a drug/placebo difference or having unacceptable toxicity.
Most clinical trials conducted have addressed amyloid targets. Since Aβ accumulates for years before the symptoms of AD are visible, some pharmaceutical companies are testing their drugs earlier, including cognitively normal people or those who have genetic profiles that place them at high risk for developing AD. 
An increasing number of agents are directed at tau-related targets. Neurofibrillary tangles are one of two major pathological hallmarks of AD. Correlation studies conducted by Braak and Braak demonstrate that neurofibrillary tangle burden more closely correlates with cognitive decline than amyloid plaque load. Several phase 3 studies conducted with tau approaches have failed. There are still several anti-tau approaches in the clinic. 
In summary, at present we believe there are no disease-modifying agents on the market. The first large effort to develop a DMD for AD has targeted Aβ42, but all Aβ42 approaches to date have failed. The first companies testing tau have shown negative results. Many companies have pulled out of AD research and are waiting to see what approach might have a better outcome. Since the AD brain contains several neurotoxic proteins—amyloid precursor protein and its toxic fragments Aβ42 and IC99, a well as tau and αSYN. We believe that a DMD drug needs to target more than just one toxic protein to be efficacious and we are developing Buntanetap with this approach in mind.
A concerning observation derived from a review of the AD pipeline is the lack of agents targeting the moderate to advanced stages of AD. With over 15 million people affected by AD dementia worldwide, there is an urgent need to develop more effective symptomatic treatments for moderate to advanced stage disease. The paucity of agents directed at this population represents a significant weakness of the AD drug development pipeline.
Parkinson’s Disease Approaches
Levodopa (“L-DOPA”) was introduced for use in treating PD more than 40 years ago and remains the mainstay of therapy for improving the symptoms of the disease. Unlike dopamine, which cannot cross the blood—brain barrier, L-DOPA is effectively absorbed into the brain, where it metabolizes into dopamine. It is typically administered five times a day and works well in controlling symptoms for one to five years. Unfortunately, the effects of L-DOPA in any patient diminish with time. There are several other drugs available to treat PD, which also seek to modulate dopamine levels. Combination drug therapy is common in PD. For instance, the use of other drug classes such as the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors and the monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors allow patients to reduce L-DOPA dosing levels. 
The market for PD drugs is estimated at $2 to $3 billion worldwide, despite high-volume generics. The most important current therapy for PD, L-DOPA, is prescribed as a generic. While volume growth in the category is expected to remain healthy, dollar growth will likely remain relatively flat as some of the category’s larger brands contend with generic inroads. The size of the current market reflects the absence of innovative branded therapies more than it does the medical need.
So far, we believe that only Buntanetap and Exenatide are in the later stages of clinical development for disease-modification and no products have yet shown efficacy in PD patients long term. Although several drugs have shown potential neuroprotective 

23



ability in preclinical studies, demonstrating these effects in clinical studies remains a challenge. Beyond drug therapies, a few cell and gene therapy approaches are also being explored. Progress across these newer technology platforms has been slow.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies, inventions and improvements that we believe are important to our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms and our product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business.
Annovis has filed seven families of patents and patent applications to prolong the patent life of Buntanetap. The pending patent applications were invented and filed by Annovis and include claims directed to:

● | a method of treating neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and PD;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a method of treating and/or preventing acute brain and nerve injuries;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a method of prevention and treatment of disease states due to metal dis-homeostasis such as AD or PD as well as other acute or chronic neurodegenerative diseases;

● | a method of treating neuropsychiatric indications.
--+---------------------------------------------------

As of February 14, 2023, our patent portfolio comprised 44 total issued patents plus 13 pending patent applications in various jurisdictions.
The issued patents have expiration dates, assuming all required fees and other charges are paid, between 2031 and 2038. Assuming each of our current patent applications are approved, our patent coverage will extend until 2043. The first patent application family we filed, which would be expected to expire, assuming all required fees and other charges are paid, in 2031, covers the use of Buntanetap at much lower doses and expands its use to the treatment of AD, PD and other neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington’s disease, prion diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, tauopathies and frontotemporal dementia, based on our preclinical research. In August 2019, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) granted the first of our Annovis patents from this family covering PD and Lewy body diseases. Subsequently the USPTO also granted patents covering tau and tauopathies, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, prion diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s disease. The second patent application family covers ANVS405’s use in acute brain and nerve trauma and would be expected to expire, assuming all required fees and other charges are paid, in 2036, before any patent term adjustments or extensions. In December 2020, the European Patent Office (“EPO”) approved the whole patent, and it has since been approved in number of other countries. However, the USPTO entered a species restriction as to the condition being treated and we are therefore currently pursuing claims directed to traumatic brain injury. We intend to file additional divisional applications when we have successfully reached a conclusion to the pending application, assuming we are not able to cover the remaining acute conditions (stroke, nerve injury and spinal cord injury) for which patent coverage is being sought in the pending application. The third patent application family relates to the use of the mechanism of action of Buntanetap and ANVS405 to prevent and treat neurodegenerative diseases and would be expected to expire, assuming all required fees and other charges are paid, in 2038, before any patent term adjustments or extensions. The first divisional of this application was approved in December 2022; it covers the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases and we are awaiting the official publishing of the patent. In May 2020, we filed a patent application with the USPTO concerning a method of inhibiting, preventing, or treating neurological injuries due to viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or parasitic infections in humans and in animals via administration of Buntanetap or related compounds which would be expected to expire, assuming all required fees and other charges are paid, in 2041, before any 

24



patent term adjustments or extensions; we have not received any office actions, yet. Recently we also filed three provisional patents - Buntanetap in cancer, Buntanetap and combinations, Buntanetap in neuropsychiatric indications.
Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our collaborators and selected consultants. 
Sales and Marketing
If Buntanetap is approved for AD or PD, we plan to enter into sales and marketing agreements with one or several pharmaceutical companies to sell to neurologists, geriatric specialists and to primary care physicians. We also may explore the use of a variety of types of collaboration, co-promotion, distribution and other marketing arrangements with one or more third parties to commercialize our product candidates.
Manufacturing
Buntanetap is a small molecule that is manufactured using a patented process. We do not own, operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We therefore rely, and expect to continue to rely, solely on third-party contractors for manufacturing clinical supplies for our current and future potential product candidates, and plan to do so for commercial supplies also if any of our product candidates received marketing approval. We also rely on these third parties for encapsulating, packaging and stabilizing clinical trial materials. Presently we are working with a U.S. supplier for the manufacture of good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) to meet our Buntanetap clinical study supply demands. We have also engaged a backup API manufacturing contractor, with primary operations in China. We have an agreement with a local U.S. supplier for the encapsulating, packaging, and stability of the clinical trial material. These arrangements will allow us to enter large and long-term advanced clinical studies. We have only limited supply agreements in place with respect to Buntanetap and our product candidates, and these arrangements do not extend to commercial supply. We do not have long term committed arrangements with respect to Buntanetap, any of our other product candidates, or other materials.
Government Regulation
The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs, such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our product candidates.
U.S. Government Regulation of Drug Products
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice regulations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

25




● | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice (“GCP”), requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Submission to the FDA of an NDA.
--+---------------------------------


● | Satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | Compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to initiate.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it initiates at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on www.clinicaltrials.gov.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

● | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

26



Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. 
Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs
The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, accelerated approval, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
To be eligible for a fast-track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. The FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast-track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the current PDUFA agreement, these six- and ten-month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for fast-track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
In addition, products tested for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (“IMM”) that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on IMM or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.
Moreover, under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act passed in July 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. At the completion of our two Phase 2 trials, one in PD and one in AD, Annovis will petition the FDA to classify Buntanetap as a breakthrough therapy.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of 

27



the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting an NDA. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for a disease or condition, the product generally will be receiving orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. Further, the FDA may approve more than one product for the same orphan indication or disease if the products contain different active ingredients. Moreover, competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity.
Marketing Approval and Post-Approval Requirements
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA, for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision.
The FDA also may require submission of a REMS plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. While the FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the 

28



product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS. 
Once an approval of a drug or medical device is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

● | Restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs or devices may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
U.S. Coverage and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of our lead product candidate, Buntanetap, or any other for which we may seek regulatory approval. Sales in the U.S. will depend in part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, which include government health programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Veterans Administration, as well as managed care organizations and private health insurers. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our product candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by payors.
The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list or formulary, which might not include all the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or another alternative is available. Medicare Part D, Medicare’s outpatient prescription drug benefit, contains protections to ensure coverage and reimbursement for oral oncology products, and all Part D prescription drug plans are required to cover substantially all oral anti-cancer agents. However, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be available. Private payors often rely on the lead of the governmental payors in rendering coverage and reimbursement determinations. Sales of Buntanetap or any other product candidates will therefore depend substantially on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by third-party payors. Achieving favorable coverage and reimbursement from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) and/or the Medicare Administrative Contractors is typically a significant gating issue for successful introduction of a new product.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for marketing, we may need to conduct studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, which would be in addition to the costs expended to obtain regulatory approvals. Third-party payors may not consider our product candidates to be medically necessary or cost-effective compared to other available therapies, or the 

29



rebate percentages required to secure favorable coverage may not yield an adequate margin over cost or may not enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development.
U.S. Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws and Compliance Requirements
We are subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales and marketing programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our operations include:

● | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services that are false or fraudulent;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | provisions of the U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act requirements, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which require manufacturers of certain drugs and biologics to track and report to CMS payments and other transfers of value they make to U.S. physicians and teaching hospitals as well as physician ownership and investment interests in the manufacturer.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regulation Outside the United States
To the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
To market our future products in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, and many other foreign jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals. More concretely, in the EEA, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (“MA”). There are two types of MAs:

● | The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

30




Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under the above-described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA assess the risk-benefit balance of the product based on scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
Data and Marketing Exclusivity
In the EEA, new products authorized for marketing, or reference products, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The 10-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
Orphan Drug Designation
In the EEA, a medicinal product can be designated as an orphan drug if its sponsor can establish that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment in development. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
In the EEA, an application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. Marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a ten-year period of market exclusivity. During this market exclusivity period, the EMA or the member state competent authorities, cannot accept another application for a marketing authorization, or grant a marketing authorization, for a similar medicinal product for the same indication. The period of market exclusivity is extended by two years for medicines that have also complied with an agreed PIP.
This period may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, for example because the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify market exclusivity. Market exclusivity can be revoked only in very selected cases, such as consent from the marketing authorization holder, inability to supply sufficient quantities of the product, demonstration of “clinical superiority” by a similar medicinal product, or, after a review by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, requested by a member state in the fifth year of the marketing exclusivity period (if the designation criteria are believed to no longer apply). Medicinal products designated as orphan drugs are eligible for incentives made available by the EU and its Member States to support research into, and the development and availability of, orphan drugs.
Human Capital Resources
As of February 2023, we had five full-time employees. We also utilize the services of twelve consultants. We also contract with additional consultants and third parties for the conduct of certain clinical development, accounting and administrative activities. We are in the process of hiring additional employees as we advance in our clinical trial program. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 

31



Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, training, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. We offer competitive compensation packages. We incentivize high performers through an annual bonus program based on our performance for which all employees are eligible. We also offer equity incentive plans, the purpose of which are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based compensation awards in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating team members to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
