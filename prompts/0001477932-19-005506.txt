ITEM 1. BUSINESSForward Looking Statements

This annual report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may”, “should”, “expects”, “plans”, “anticipates”, “believes”, “estimates”, “predicts”, “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions.

While these forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the direction of our business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions or other future performance suggested in this report. Except as required by applicable law, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.

As used in this annual report, the terms “we”, “us” and “our” mean Leafbuyer Technologies, Inc., unless otherwise indicated.

Business Overview

Leafbuyer.com Platform

The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, LB Media Group, LLC has evolved and grown from a listing website focused on helping consumers find local cannabis-related retail establishments, into a comprehensive technology company with a suite of marketing tools designed to serve legal cannabis businesses. The Company’s website, Leafbuyer.com, hosts a robust search algorithm similar to Trivago, where consumers can search the database for appealing offers or specific items. In addition to these digital acquisition tools, Leafbuyer provides a loyalty platform, online ordering, and SEO services ultimately aiming to be the “one-stop shop” for businesses in the challenging cannabis industry. Leafbuyer reaches millions of consumers every month and is the official cannabis deals platform LA Weekly, Grasscity, Voice Media Group, and The Stranger.

The site’s sophisticated vendor dashboard pairs vendor data with consumer needs and presents a robust, 24/7 real-time dashboard where vendors can update menus, specials, available jobs, and more. The system helps to track the vendors’ return on investment.

The Company continues an aggressive push into all legal cannabis markets, including initiating a presence in the Canadian market. Increasing the company’s marketing and sales presence in new markets is a primary objective. Along with this expansion, the Company continues to develop new technologies that will serve cannabis dispensaries and product companies in attracting and retaining consumers.

Leafbuyer operates in a rapidly evolving and highly regulated industry that, as has been estimated by some, will exceed $30 billion in revenue by the year 2020. The founders and board of directors has been, and will continue to be, aggressive in pursuing long-term opportunities.

The Team

The Company has 25 full-time employees working out of its headquarters in Greenwood Village, Colorado. In addition, the company currently has sales teams in Washington, California and Oregon. Leafbuyer also has relationships with approximately 23 independent contractors which it retains from time to time.

A majority of our employees are involved in sales and customer service. Other services, such as website content and graphics design are outsourced to independent contractors.

One of the Company’s top priorities in 2019 has been recruiting and retaining some of the top talent in the cannabis and technology industries. We anticipate a majority of our future hiring will be in markets outside of Colorado.

Growth State by State

Our primary customers have been legal cannabis dispensaries and companies who create cannabis-related products. As more states legalize cannabis, we hope the consumer and potential customer base will expand. We believe that the transformation in California from a purely medical legal state to a recreational state will create great opportunities for our company. We intend to duplicate the model that has worked for us in Colorado in each market as it develops.

The marginal cost for Leafbuyer to enter a market is minimal in comparison to growers or retail operations. In order for us to enter a new market, most of our costs include sales and marketing personnel and grassroots efforts to grow the consumer base in the new market. We believe that we can replicate our success in Colorado in the past four years of operations in other states that adopt legal cannabis use. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so.

Other companies who deal with cannabis directly have significant legal and capital barriers impeding their growth into another state. However, since we are an ancillary company, most of the current regulations and strict cannabis laws do not pertain to our operations. Because of the overall growth in the market and low legal barriers, we believe that growth opportunities are very significant for the foreseeable future.

2019 and Beyond

The global legal marijuana market size is expected to reach $66.3 billion by the end of 2025, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc. It is anticipated to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 23.9% during the forecast period. Increasing legalization of marijuana for medicinal and recreational purposes is expected to continue.

Our business model is designed to benefit from this trend. When a new state passes a medical or recreational cannabis law, we can start marketing to consumers and businesses in that state with minimal marginal cost. Because Leafbuyer is not involved in the production or sale of cannabis, we do not have to build expensive grow operations and open brick and mortar stores. As more states pass laws to offer legal cannabis products, we begin marketing into the state and sign up dispensaries to be on the platform.

We plan to grow the company organically through the aggressive deployment of sales and marketing resources into legal cannabis states. We understand that to become a significant player in the industry in the future will require us to look for acquisitions for a significant portion of that growth. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate and acquire such opportunities or that they will be on terms that are favorable to the Company.
