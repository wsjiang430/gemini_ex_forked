ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Baker Hughes, a GE company (the Company, BHGE, we, us, or our), a Delaware corporation, was formed on October 28, 2016, for the purpose of facilitating the combination of Baker Hughes Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (Baker Hughes or BHI), and the oil and gas business (GE O&G) of General Electric Company (GE). 
On July 3, 2017, we closed our business combination (the Transactions) to combine GE O&G and Baker Hughes creating a fullstream oilfield technology provider that has a unique mix of integrated equipment and service capabilities. As a result of the Transactions, substantially all of the business of GE O&G and of Baker Hughes was transferred to a subsidiary of the Company, Baker Hughes, a GE company, LLC (BHGE LLC) with GE having an economic interest of approximately 62.5% and the Company having an economic interest of approximately 37.5% of BHGE LLC. The Transactions were treated as a “reverse acquisition” for accounting purposes and, as such, the historical financial statements of the accounting acquirer, GE O&G, are the historical financial statements of the Company. The historical financial results in the combined financial statements presented may not be indicative of the results that would have been achieved had GE O&G operated as a separate, stand-alone entity during those periods.
 As of December 31, 2018, GE held approximately 50.4% of the economic interest and the Company held approximately 49.6% of the economic interest in BHGE LLC. Although we hold a minority economic interest in BHGE LLC, we conduct and exercise full control over all its activities, without the approval of any other member. Accordingly, we consolidate the financial results of BHGE LLC and report a noncontrolling interest in our consolidated and combined financial statements for the economic interest in BHGE LLC not held by us. We are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership interest in BHGE LLC and certain intercompany and tax related balances. BHGE LLC is a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Registrant with separate filing requirements with the SEC and its separate financial information can be obtained from www.sec.gov. 
In June 2018, GE announced their intention to pursue an orderly separation from BHGE over time. On November 13, 2018, we entered into a Master Agreement and a series of related ancillary agreements and binding term sheets with GE (collectively, the Master Agreement Framework) designed to further solidify the commercial and technological collaborations between us and GE and to facilitate our ability to transition from operating as a controlled company. In particular, the Master Agreement Framework contemplates long-term agreements between us and GE on technology, fulfillment and other key areas to provide greater clarity to customers, employees and shareholders. For a discussion of certain risks associated with the separation, including risks related to our business, financial condition and results of operations, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Factors Related to the Transactions and Separation from GE.” For further details on the Master Agreement Framework, see "Note 18. Related Party Disclosures" of the Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in Item 8 herein. 
Secondary Offering and LLC Units Repurchase
In November 2018, we also completed an underwritten secondary public offering in which GE and its affiliates (together, the selling stockholders) sold 101.2 million shares of our Class A common stock. We did not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by the selling stockholders in this offering. The offering included the exchange by the selling stockholders of common units of BHGE LLC (Units) (together with the corresponding shares of our Class B common stock) for our Class A common stock, which resulted in increases in capital in excess of par value, with offsetting reductions in noncontrolling interests and other comprehensive income.
Also, in November 2018, we repurchased 65 million BHGE LLC Units (together with the corresponding shares of our Class B common stock) from GE and its affiliates for $1.5 billion, or $22.48 per unit, which is the same per share price, net of discounts and commissions, paid by the underwriters to the selling stockholders in the offering (the repurchase). In connection with the repurchase, the corresponding shares of Class B common stock held by GE and its affiliates were canceled. As a result of the secondary offering and the repurchase, GE's economic interest in BHGE LLC was reduced from approximately 62.5% to approximately 50.4%. If GE's economic interest in BHGE LLC falls below 50%, they would not have a controlling interest. Any future declines in their ownership would be accounted for by us as equity transactions reducing their noncontrolling interests.

We are a global business and generate revenue and orders from a combination of equipment sales and services. In 2018, 40% of revenue was generated from equipment sales and 60% from services, while 42% of orders were for equipment and 58% for services. In 2017 and 2016, 42% and 47% of revenue was generated from equipment sales, and 58% and 53% of revenue was from services, respectively. We recognized orders of $23,904 million, $17,159 million, and $11,066 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations totaled $21.0 billion, $21.0 billion, and $21.8 billion, respectively. 
Our statement of income (loss) displays sales and costs of sales in accordance with SEC regulations under which “goods” is required to include all sales of tangible products and “services” must include all other sales, including other services activities. For the amounts shown above, as well as in the orders included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Item 7 in this Form 10-K, we distinguish between “equipment” and “product services,” where product services refers to sales under product services agreements, including sales of both goods (such as spare parts and equipment upgrades) and related services (such as monitoring, maintenance and repairs), which is an important part of its operations. We refer to “product services” simply as “services” within this Business section and the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Item 7 in this Form 10-K.
Remaining performance obligations (RPO), a defined term under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), are unfilled customer orders for products and product services excluding any purchase order that provides the customer with the ability to cancel or terminate without incurring a substantive penalty, even if the likelihood of cancellation is remote based on historical experience. For product services, an amount is included for the expected life of the contract.

Our primary sales channel is through our direct sales force, which has a strong regional focus with local teams close to the customer, who are able to draw support from centers of excellence in each of our major product lines. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenue in the current year.
Our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets and the competitive environment varies by product line, as discussed below: 
Oilfield Services
Our OFS segment believes that the principal competitive factors in the industries and markets it serves are product and service quality, reliability and availability, health, safety and environmental standards, technical proficiency, and price. Our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets and revenue and earnings are affected by changes in commodity prices, fluctuations in the level of drilling, workover and completion activity in major markets, general economic conditions, foreign currency exchange fluctuations and governmental regulations. While we may have contracts with customers that include multiple well projects and that may extend over a period of time ranging from two to four years, our services and products are generally provided on a well-by-well basis. Most contracts cover our pricing of the products and services, but do not necessarily establish an obligation to use our products and services. OFS segment competitors include Schlumberger, Halliburton, and Weatherford International.

In the surface pressure control product line the primary competitors include Cactus Wellhead, TechnipFMC, and Schlumberger.
Turbomachinery & Process Solutions 
Our TPS segment believes that the principal competitive factors in the industries and markets it serves are product range (or power range measured in megawatts) coverage, efficiency, product reliability and availability, service capabilities, packages, references, emissions, and price. In upstream and midstream applications, our primary equipment competitors include Siemens (Power and Gas business unit), Solar (a Caterpillar company), MAN Turbo, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. In downstream applications, TPS primarily competes with original equipment manufacturers and independent service providers, including Flowserve, Siemens, Elliott Ebara, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Our aftermarket equipment product line competes with smaller, independent local providers such as Masaood John Brown, Sulzer, MTU, and Chromalloy.
Digital Solutions 
Our DS segment believes that the principal competitive factors in the industries and markets it serves are superior product technology, service, quality, and reliability. Our DS segment competes across a wide range of industries, including oil & gas, power generation, aerospace, and light and heavy industrials. The products and services are sold in a diversified, fragmented arena with a broad range of competitors. Although no single company competes directly with DS across all its product lines, various companies compete in one or more products. Competitors include Emerson, Honeywell Process Solutions, Olympus, Schneider Electric, and Siemens.
CONTRACTS
We conduct our business under various types of contracts in the upstream, midstream, and downstream segments, including fixed-fee or turnkey contracts, transactional agreements for products and services, and long-term aftermarket service agreements.
We enjoy stable relationships with many of our customers based on long-term project contracts and master service agreements. Several of those contracts require us to commit to a fixed price based on the customer’s technical specifications with little or no legal relief available due to changes in circumstances, such as changes in local laws or industry or geopolitical events. In some cases, failure to deliver products or perform services within contractual commitments may lead to liquidated damages claims. We seek to mitigate these exposures through close collaboration with our customers. 
We strive to negotiate the terms of our customer contracts consistent with what we consider to be industry best practices. Our customers typically indemnify us for certain claims arising from: the injury or death of their employees and often their other contractors; the loss of or damage to their equipment and often that of their other contractors; pollution originating from their equipment or facility; and all liabilities related to the well and subsurface operations, including loss or damage to the well or reservoir, loss of well control, fire, explosion, or any uncontrolled flow of oil or gas. Conversely, we typically indemnify our customers for certain claims arising from: the injury or death of our employees and sometimes that of our subcontractors; the loss of or damage to our equipment (other than equipment lost in the hole); and pollution originating from our equipment above the surface of the earth while in our care, custody, and control. Where the above indemnities do not apply or are not consistent with industry best practices, we typically provide a capped indemnity for damages caused to the customer by our negligence or the negligence of our contractors, and include an overall limitation of liability clause. It is also our general practice to include a limitation of liability for consequential loss, including loss of profits and loss of revenue, in all customer contracts.
BHGE 2018 FORM 10-K | 6

Our indemnity structure may not protect us in every case. Certain U.S. states such as Texas, Louisiana, Wyoming, and New Mexico have enacted oil and natural gas specific anti-indemnity statutes. These statutes can void the allocation of liability agreed to in a contract, however, both the Texas and Louisiana anti-indemnity statutes include important exclusions. The Louisiana statute does not apply to property damage, and the Texas statute allows mutual indemnity agreements that are supported by insurance and has exclusions, which include, among other things, loss or liability for property damage that results from pollution and the cost of well control events. State law, laws or public policy in countries outside the U.S., or the negotiated terms of a customer contract may also limit indemnity obligations in the event of the gross negligence or willful misconduct. We sometimes contract with customers that are not the end user of our products. It is our practice to seek to obtain an indemnity from our customer for any end-user claims, but this is not always possible. Similarly, government agencies and other third parties, including in some cases other contractors of our customers, may make claims in respect of which we are not indemnified and for which responsibility is assessed proportionate to fault. In all cases, deviations from our standard contracting practices are examined through an established risk deviation process.
The Company maintains a commercial general liability insurance policy program that covers against certain operating hazards, including product liability claims and personal injury claims, as well as certain limited environmental pollution claims for damage to a third party or its property arising out of contact with pollution for which the Company is liable, however, clean up and well control costs are not covered by such program. All of the insurance policies purchased by the Company are subject to deductible and/or self-insured retention amounts for which we are responsible for payment, specific terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions. There can be no assurance that the nature and amount of Company insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities related to our business.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
We engage in research and development activities directed primarily toward the development of new products, services, technology, and other solutions, as well as the improvement of existing products and services and the design of specialized products to meet specific customer needs. We continue to invest across all operating segments in products to develop capability, improve performance, and reduce costs. In OFS, we invested in a range of formation evaluation capabilities as well as drilling, completions, and production hardware. This included the introduction of Electrical Submersible Pumps (ESP’s) with permanent magnet motors for higher efficiency through reduced power consumption. In OFE, the recent focus has been to expand capability into deeper water, longer offsets and at higher pressures as well as modular designs that allow for simpler and more integrated subsea systems. Additionally, subsea power and processing is also an area in which we are investing, covering both pumping and compression. In TPS, we continue to invest in continuous product improvement of reciprocating and centrifugal compressors, using advanced fluid dynamic simulation and advanced aeromechanics to improve capability, operability and efficiency of its centrifugal compressors family. Further, we continue to invest in our latest generation of gas turbines for energy efficiency and reduced carbon footprint. DS continues to invest in advanced digital solutions designed to improve the efficiency, reliability and safety of oil and gas production operations. These systems integrate operational data and provide analytics from producing oil and gas facilities helping to prevent unplanned downtime and improve facility reliability. In addition, DS invests in a broad range of measurement and control solutions spanning multiple industries, including methane detection systems for oil and gas operations and inspection technology for consumer electronics.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Our technology, brands and other intellectual property (IP) rights are important elements of our business. We rely on patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as non-disclosure and employee invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. Many patents and patent applications comprise the BHGE portfolio and are owned by us. Other patents and patent applications applicable to our products and services are licensed to us by GE and, in some cases, third parties. We do not consider any individual patent to be material to our business operations.
In connection with the Master Agreement Framework, GE has now entered into an amended and restated IP cross-license agreement (the IP Cross-License Agreement) with BHGE LLC. GE has agreed to perpetually license to BHGE LLC the right to use certain intellectual property owned or controlled by GE pursuant to the terms of the IP Cross-License Agreement. BHGE LLC has in return also agreed to perpetually license to GE the right to use certain intellectual property rights pursuant to the terms of the IP Cross-License Agreement. This 
BHGE 2018 FORM 10-K | 7

license allows BHGE LLC to have continued and permanent rights to commercially utilize some GE intellectual property pursuant to the terms of the IP Cross-License Agreement. 
We follow a policy of seeking patent and trademark protection in numerous countries and regions throughout the world for products and methods that appear to have commercial significance. We believe that protection of our patents, trademarks, and related intellectual property rights is central to the conduct of our business, and aggressively pursue protection of our intellectual property rights against infringement worldwide as we deem appropriate to protect our business. Additionally, we consider the quality and timely delivery of our products, the service we provide to our customers, and the technical knowledge and skills of our personnel to be other important components of the portfolio of capabilities and assets supporting our ability to compete.
SEASONALITY
Our operations can be affected by seasonal weather, which can temporarily affect the delivery and performance of our products and services, and our customers' budgetary cycles. Examples of seasonal events that can impact our business are set forth below:

• | The severity and duration of both the summer and the winter in North America can have a significant impact on activity levels. In Canada, the timing and duration of the spring thaw directly affects activity levels, which reach seasonal lows during the second quarter and build through the third and fourth quarters to a seasonal high in the first quarter. 


• | Adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, may interrupt or curtail our coastal and offshore drilling, or our customers’ operations, cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities, which may or may not be insured.


• | Severe weather during the winter months normally results in reduced activity levels in the North Sea and Russia generally in the first quarter and may interrupt or curtail our operations, or our customers’ operations, in those areas and result in a loss of revenue.


• | Scheduled repair and maintenance of offshore facilities in the North Sea can reduce activity in the second and third quarters.


• | Many of our international oilfield customers increase orders for certain products and services in the fourth quarter.


• | Our process & pipeline business in the DS segment typically experiences lower sales during the first and fourth quarters of the year due to the Northern Hemisphere winter.


• | Our broader DS business typically experiences higher customer activity as a result of spending patterns in the second half of the year.

RAW MATERIALS
We purchase various raw materials and component parts for use in manufacturing our products and delivering our services.  The principal raw materials we use include steel alloys, chromium, nickel, titanium, barite, beryllium, copper, lead, tungsten carbide, synthetic and natural diamonds, gels, sand and other proppants, printed circuit boards and other electronic components, and hydrocarbon-based chemical feed stocks.  Raw materials that are essential to our business are normally readily available from multiple sources, but may be subject to price volatility.  Market conditions can trigger constraints in the supply of certain raw materials, and we are always seeking ways to ensure the availability and manage the cost of raw materials.  Our procurement department uses its size and buying power to enhance its access to key materials at competitive prices.
In addition to raw materials and component parts, we also use the products and services of metal fabricators, machine shops, foundries, forge shops, assembly operations, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, packagers, indirect material providers, and others in order to produce and deliver products to customers.  These materials and services are generally available from multiple sources.
BHGE 2018 FORM 10-K | 8

EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 66,000 employees, of which the majority are outside the U.S. Approximately 11% of these employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements or similar-type labor arrangements.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
We are committed to the health and safety of people, protection of the environment and compliance with environmental laws, regulations and our policies. Our past and present operations include activities that are subject to extensive domestic (including U.S. federal, state and local) and international regulations with regard to air, land and water quality and other environmental matters. Regulations continue to evolve, and changes in standards of enforcement of existing regulations, as well as the enactment of new legislation, may require us and our customers to modify, supplement or replace equipment or facilities or to change or discontinue present methods of operation. Our environmental compliance expenditures and our capital costs for environmental control equipment may change accordingly.
We are, and may in the future be, involved in voluntary remediation projects at current and former properties. On rare occasions, our remediation activities are conducted as specified by a government agency-issued consent decree or agreed order. Remediation costs at these properties are accrued using currently available facts, existing environmental permits, technology and presently enacted laws and regulations. For sites where we are primarily responsible for the remediation, our cost estimates are developed based on internal evaluations and are not discounted. We record accruals when it is probable that we will be obligated to pay amounts for environmental site evaluation, remediation or related activities, and such amounts can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are recorded even if significant uncertainties exist over the ultimate cost of the remediation. Ongoing environmental compliance costs, such as obtaining environmental permits, installation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and waste disposal, are expensed as incurred.
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (known as "Superfund") imposes liability for the release of a "hazardous substance" into the environment. Superfund liability is imposed without regard to fault, even if the waste disposal was in compliance with laws and regulations. We have been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at various Superfund sites, and we accrue our share of the estimated remediation costs for the site. PRPs in Superfund actions have joint and several liability and may be required to pay more than their proportional share of such costs. 
In some cases, it is not possible to quantify our ultimate exposure because the projects are either in the investigative or early remediation stage, or superfund allocation information is not yet available. Based upon current information, we believe that our overall compliance with environmental regulations, including remediation obligations, environmental compliance costs and capital expenditures for environmental control equipment, will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position because we have either established adequate reserves or our compliance cost, based on available information, is not expected to be material to our consolidated and combined financial statements. Our total accrual for environmental remediation was $84 million and $82 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
