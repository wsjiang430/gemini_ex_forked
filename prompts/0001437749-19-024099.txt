--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have a history of successfully delivering innovative systems and solutions, pioneering the acoustic hailing device (“AHD”) market with the introduction of our first LRAD AHD in 2003, creating the first multidirectional public safety mass notification systems that project sirens and audible voice messages with industry-leading vocal clarity and area coverage in 2012, and recently revolutionizing the mass notification industry with the only unified platform that combines audible, highly intelligible voice broadcast systems and digital, CCaaS software mobile mass messaging solutions.
 
The Company’s critical communication systems are being used in 72 countries throughout the world in diverse applications, including public safety, national emergency warning systems, mass notification, defense, law enforcement, critical infrastructure protection, and many more. We continue to develop new communication innovations and believe we have significant competitive advantages in our principal markets. 
 
Technology and Products 
 
Our LRAD systems are a technological breakthrough in broadcasting audible, highly intelligible voice messages and tones over long distances and high ambient noise using minimal power. By broadcasting audible voice messages with exceptional vocal clarity and only where needed, we offer novel sound applications that conventional bullhorns, loudspeakers, public address and emergency warning systems cannot achieve.

Our LRAD products were initially developed for the U.S. Navy to fill a capability gap identified after the October 2000 attack on the USS Cole. LRAD systems are deployed by the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, National Guard and Coast Guard, as well as international military services, and maritime, public safety and commercial security organizations. We have redesigned and enhanced our LRAD AHDs with improved voice intelligibility, output and durability. The rugged construction of our systems enables us to meet stringent military specifications. Our LRAD AHDs are designed to enable users to safely hail and warn, inform and direct, prevent misunderstandings, determine intent, establish large safety zones, resolve uncertain situations, and save lives.
 
Our LRAD AHD product line provides a complete range of solutions from handheld, portable devices to permanently installed, remotely operated systems. We continue to add new models to meet specific customer requirements and to expand into new markets. We have also added various features and accessories, including wireless capability, record on-the-fly microphones, integrated and remote electronics packages, and amplifiers. 
 
Building on the success of our LRAD AHDs, we designed and developed our multidirectional mass notification product line. Unlike most siren based installations, our public safety notification systems broadcast both emergency warning sirens and highly intelligible voice messages with uniform 60° - 360° coverage over local and wide areas. We believe our ability to shape the broadcast coverage area, our industry-leading speech intelligibility, and our multiple system activation and control options enable us to successfully compete in the large and growing mass notification market. 
 
We continue to enhance our acoustic communication technologies and product lines to provide a complete range of systems and accessories. Our patented XL driver technology, which generates higher audio output in a smaller and lighter form factor, is being incorporated into our LRAD AHD and mass notifications systems. To date, we have incorporated our XL driver technology into the LRAD 450XL, LRAD 1950XL, LRAD 950RXL, LRAD DS-60XL, LRAD 360XL, and LRAD 360XL-MID. We are enhancing our system design and manufacturing capabilities to improve the durability and performance of our products. Our systems have been competitively selected over other commercially available systems by the U.S. Department of Defense and numerous international militaries.

Strategy 
 
The proliferation of natural disasters, crisis situations and civil disturbances require technologically advanced, multi-channel solutions to deliver clear and timely critical communications to help make and keep the public safe during emergencies. Businesses are also incorporating communication systems that locate and help safeguard employees when critical events occur.
 
By providing the only unified platform that combines audible, highly intelligible voice broadcast systems and CCaaS software, Genasys seeks to deliver a reliable, fast and intuitive solution for sending location-based audible voice communications and geolocation-targeted messages and texts to mobile devices to help keep the public and employees safe.
 
Genasys has developed a global market and an increased demand for LRAD systems and revolutionary public safety notification solutions. We have a reputation for producing quality products that feature industry-leading broadcast area coverage, vocal intelligibility and geo-targeted mass messaging. While the mass notification market is more mature with many established manufacturers and suppliers, we believe that our advanced technology and unified platform provides opportunities to succeed in the large and growing public safety, emergency warning and mass notification markets. We also plan to expand and strengthen domestic and international sales channels by adding key mass notification partners, distributors, and dealers.
 
We plan to continue building on our AHD leadership position by offering enhanced directional and multidirectional voice broadcast systems and accessories for an expanding range of applications. In executing our strategy, we use direct sales to governments, militaries, large end-users, and system integrators. We have built a worldwide distribution channel consisting of partners and resellers that have significant expertise and experience selling integrated communication solutions into our various target markets. As our primary AHD sales opportunities are with domestic and international government, military and law enforcement agencies, we are subject to each customer’s unique budget cycle, which leads to long selling cycles and uneven revenue flow, complicating our product planning. 
 
In fiscal 2020, we intend to continue to pursue domestic and international business opportunities with the support of business development consultants, key representatives and resellers. We plan to grow our revenues through increased direct sales to militaries and large commercial and defense-related companies that desire to integrate our communication technologies into their product offerings. This includes building on fiscal 2019 domestic defense sales by pursuing further U.S. military opportunities. We also plan to pursue mass notification, government, law enforcement, fire rescue, homeland and international security, private and commercial security, border security, maritime security, and wildlife preservation and control business opportunities.
 
Our research and development strategy is to continue innovating voice broadcast systems and accessories, and mobile alert solutions to meet the needs of our target markets. Our PSMN product line includes emitters and speaker arrays in different sizes, as well as various configurations of amplifiers, mounts, power sources, and software. We developed and patented our XL driver technology, which generates higher audio output in smaller, lighter form factors. We have incorporated our XL driver technology into the LRAD 450XL, LRAD 1950XL, LRAD 950RXL, LRAD DS-60XL, LRAD 360XL, and LRAD 360XL-MID. Our LRAD PSMN systems and CCaaS software represent more complex, integrated offerings. We are pursuing certain certifications, which are often required when bidding on government and mass notification opportunities. We intend to invest engineering resources to enhance our PSMN systems and CCaaS software to compete for larger mass notification business opportunities. We are also configuring alternative solutions to achieve lower price points to meet the needs of certain customers or applications. We also engage in ongoing value engineering to reduce the cost and simplify the manufacturing of our products.

We intend to continue operating with financial discipline in order to create value for our shareholders. We are focused on growing top line revenue by successfully entering new markets and expanding our market share in the global mass notification market, which we believe will translate into increased net profit growth.
 
Manufacturing and Suppliers

Manufacturing. We believe maintaining quality manufacturing capacity is essential to the performance of our products and the growth of our business. Our technologies are different from mass-produced designs, and our manufacturing and assembly involves unique processes and materials. We contract with third-party suppliers to produce various components and sub-assemblies. At the end of fiscal year 2018, the Company moved to a new facility with expanded engineering and manufacturing capacity to support current and expected business growth. In our facility, we complete the final assembly, test and ship our products. We have refined our internal processes to improve how we design, test, and qualify products. We continue to implement rigorous manufacturing and quality processes to track production and field failures. We also perform third-party testing and certification of our products to ensure that they meet rigorous military and commercial specifications. We implement design and component changes periodically to reduce our product costs and improve product reliability and manufacturability. 
Suppliers. We minimize inventories and maximize the efficiency of our supply chain by having a large number of components and sub-assemblies produced by outside suppliers mostly located within 50 miles of our facility. The Company relies on one supplier for compression drivers for its LRAD products and is making efforts to obtain alternative suppliers to reduce such reliance. The Company’s ability to manufacture its LRAD products could be adversely affected if it were to lose this sole source supplier and was unable to find an alternative supplier. We also purchase several key components and sub-assemblies from foreign suppliers. Consequently, we are subject to the impact economic conditions can have on such suppliers and the fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates, which could impact our lead times and product costs. We have developed strong relationships with a number of our key suppliers. If these suppliers should experience quality problems or part shortages, our production schedules could be significantly delayed or our costs significantly increased. 
Sales and Marketing

We market and sell products and services through our sales force based in California, Colorado, Florida, Wisconsin, and Spain as well as through full-time business consultants in Texas, Germany and Thailand. Our corporate and administrative offices are located in San Diego, California. 
 
We sell directly to governments, militaries, large end-users, and defense-related companies. We use independent representatives on a commission basis to assist in our direct sales efforts. We also use a channel distribution model, in which we sell our products directly to independent resellers and system integrators around the world, who then sell our products (or our products integrated with other systems) to end-user customers. We are focusing our internal business development resources on building relationships with defense integrators and other large direct customers. In addition, we utilize part-time consultants with expertise in various U.S. government and defense sectors to advise us on procedures and budgetary policies in an effort to be successful in these areas. 
 
We have a global reputation for providing high quality, innovative voice broadcast systems and mobile alert solutions that have made Genasys and LRAD internationally recognized product brands. We actively promote our brands and products through our website, trade shows, and advertising. We intend to increase the use of our trademarks throughout our product distribution chain and believe growing brand awareness will assist in expanding our business. We believe our reputation for technological expertise, quality products, and strong service and support provide us competitive advantages.
 
Customer Concentration

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, we had two customers accounting for 37% and 10% of revenues, with no other single customer accounting for more than 10% of revenues. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, we had one customer accounting for 20% of revenues, with no other single customer accounting for more than 10% of revenues.
 
Our revenues to date have relied on a few major customers. The loss of any customer could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have made progress diversifying our revenues and expect to continue to do so in future periods.

Backlog

Our order backlog for products that are deliverable in the next 12 months was approximately $27,014,253 at September 30, 2019, compared to $23,646,910 at September 30, 2018. The amount of backlog at any point in time is dependent upon scheduled delivery dates to our customers and product lead times. Our backlog orders are supported by firm purchase orders. 
Warranties

We generally warrant our products to be free from material and workmanship defects for a period up to one year from the date of purchase. The warranty is generally a limited warranty, and in some instances imposes certain shipping costs on the customer. We generally provide direct warranty service, but at times we may establish warranty service through third parties.
 
We also provide repair and maintenance agreements and extended warranty contracts at market rates, with terms ranging from one year to several years, as an additional source of revenue and to provide increased customer satisfaction. 
 
Competition

Our technologies and products compete with those of other companies. Commercial and government audio industry markets are fragmented and include numerous manufacturers with audio products that vary widely in price, quality, and distribution channels. Present and potential competitors have, or may have, substantially greater resources to devote to product development. We believe we compete primarily on the originality of our products, the uniqueness of our technology and designs, and our responsiveness to customers and the ability to meet their needs. We believe the quality, durability, and superior performance of our products, which have been developed by incorporating feedback from our customers, and our desire to provide the highest quality products, also provide us competitive advantages.
 
Our LRAD AHD product line features the leading voice broadcast systems for military and commercial applications. Our AHD competitors include Ultra Electronics/USSI, IML Sound Commander, and others. We do not believe these competitors have achieved significant global market penetration in the AHD market to date. We believe our LRAD AHD product line has demonstrated acceptance, has performed extremely well in harsh environments, and can continue to compete on the basis of technical features, performance, ease of use, quality and cost. As we continue to grow this market, future competitors may enter, which could impact our competitiveness. 
 
In the mature and established mass notification market, we compete against several domestic and international competitors, including Everbridge, OnSolve, Whelen Engineering Company Inc., Hoermann, and others. We believe our ability to offer a reliable, fast and intuitive solution for sending location-based SMS, text, email and social media messages to mobile devices in defined geographic areas and providing the only platform that unifies voice broadcast and digital, CCaaS software gives us significant competitive advantages against these established organizations. Further advantages include our ability to shape the broadcast coverage area from 60° - 360°, our industry-leading voice broadcast intelligibility, and our multiple system activation and control options, including satellite, TCP/IP, fiber, Wi-Fi, digital or analog radio, Ethernet or hard wire. We believe our platform’s ease of integration with external sensors and inputs, and compatibility with major emergency warning protocols also provide competitive advantages. We believe the domestic and international markets for public safety, emergency warning and mass notification are substantial and growing. 
 
Seasonality

Because our sales are primarily to domestic and international government departments or agencies, our selling cycles tend to be long and difficult to forecast. We have not experienced any significant seasonality trends to date, but we may experience increased seasonality in the future. 
Government Regulation

We are subject to a variety of government laws and regulations that apply to companies engaged in international operations, including, among others, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.S. Department of Commerce export controls, local government regulations and procurement policies and practices (including regulations relating to import-export control, investments, exchange controls and repatriation of earnings). We maintain controls and procedures to comply with laws and regulations associated with our international operations. If we are unable to remain compliant with such laws and regulations, our business may be adversely affected. 
 
 6



Our products are produced to comply with standard product safety requirements for sale in the U.S. and similar requirements for sale in Europe and Canada. We expect to meet the electrical and other regulatory requirements for electronic systems or components we sell throughout the world. 
 
Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas

Financial information regarding our segments and the geographic areas in which we operate is contained in Note 17, Segment Information, and Note 18, Major Customers, Suppliers and Related Information to our consolidated financial statements.
Intellectual Property Rights and Proprietary Information

We operate in an industry where innovation, investment in new ideas, and protection of resulting intellectual property rights are important drivers of success. We rely on a variety of intellectual property protections for our products and technologies, including patent, trademark and trade secret laws, and contractual obligations. We pursue a policy of vigorously enforcing our intellectual property rights. 
 
In addition to such factors as innovation, technological expertise, and experienced personnel, we believe strong product offerings that are continually upgraded and enhanced will keep us competitive, and we will seek patent protection on important technological improvements that we make. We have an ongoing policy of filing patent applications to seek protection for novel features of our products and technologies. Prior to the filing and granting of patents, our policy is to disclose key features to patent counsel and maintain these features as trade secrets prior to product introduction. Patent applications may not result in issued patents covering all-important claims and could be denied in their entirety. We also file for trade name and trademark protection when appropriate. We are the owner of federally registered trademarks, including LRAD®, LONG RANGE ACOUSTIC DEVICE®, LRAD-X®, LRAD-RX®, and SOUNDSABER®. Many of our registered trademarks have earned worldwide brand recognition. 
 
Our policy is to enter into nondisclosure agreements with each employee and consultant or third party to whom any of our proprietary information is disclosed. These agreements prohibit the disclosure of confidential information to others, both during and subsequent to employment, or the duration of the working relationship. These agreements may not prevent disclosure of confidential information or provide adequate remedies for any breach. 
 
Research and Development

The sound reproduction and software markets are subject to rapid changes in technology and design with frequent improvements and new product introductions, as well as customized solutions for specific customer applications. We believe our future success will depend on our ability to enhance and improve existing technologies and to introduce new technologies and products on a competitive basis that meet the needs of our customers. Accordingly, we are continuing to engage in significant research and new product development activities. 
 
For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, we spent approximately $4.5 million and $3.5 million, respectively, on company-sponsored research and development. Future levels of research and development expenditures will vary depending on the timing of further new product development and the availability of funds to carry on additional research and development on currently owned technologies or in other areas.
