ITEM 1. BUSINESS
References herein to "Hunt Companies Finance Trust," "company," "HCFT," "we," "us," or "our" refer to Hunt Companies Finance Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and its subsidiaries under the context specifically requires otherwise.
General 

We are a real estate investment trust primarily focused on investing in, financing and managing transitional multi-family and other commercial real estate loans. Historically, the Company primarily invested in, financed and managed residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS"), multi-family mortgage-backed securities ("Multi-Family MBS"), mortgage servicing rights and other mortgage-related investments. As of January 18, 2018, the Company is externally managed by Hunt Investment Management, LLC (the "Manager" or "HIM") pursuant to the terms of our management agreement. HIM is an affiliate of Hunt Companies Inc. ("Hunt"), a private, diversified real estate company .
We are a Maryland corporation formed in March 2012 and commenced operations in May 2012. We have elected and qualified to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Code"). On May 29, 2018, we changed our name from Five Oaks Investment Corp. ("Five Oaks") to Hunt Companies Finance Trust, Inc., our common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, under the symbol "HCFT" and our Series A Preferred Stock began trading on the NYSE under the symbol "HCFT PR A." Previously, our common stock was listed on the NYSE, under the symbol “OAKS” and our Series A Preferred Stock was listed on the NYSE under the symbol “OAKS-PRA”. On February 14, 2019, we completed the redemption of all of our previously issued Series A Preferred Stock. For information regarding our subsidiaries and their operations as well as for the geographical concentrations of the mortgage loans underlying certain of our assets, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Notes to our consolidated financial statements.
The Hunt Transaction
On January 18, 2018, we announced a new strategic direction, and the entry into a new external management agreement with HIM, an affiliate of Hunt. We concurrently mutually terminated our management agreement with Oak Circle Capital Partners, LLC ("Oak Circle"). Management by HIM is expected to provide the Company with a new strategic direction through the reallocation of capital into new investment opportunities focused in the commercial real estate mortgage space and direct access to Hunt's pipeline of transitional floating-rate multi-family and commercial real estate loans. Hunt and its affiliates have extensive experience in the origination, servicing, risk management and financing of this asset class and the floating-rate nature of the loans should reduce or eliminate the need for complex interest rate hedging. The new management agreement is expected to better align our interests with those of our new manager through an incentive fee arrangement and agreed upon limitations on manager expense reimbursements from us, as further described below. Pursuant to the terms of the termination agreement between the Company and Oak Circle, the termination of the prior management agreement did not trigger, and Oak Circle was not paid, a termination fee by us. Hunt separately agreed to pay Oak Circle a negotiated payment in connection with the termination agreement.
In connection with the transaction, an affiliate of Hunt purchased 1,539,406 shares of our common stock in a private placement, at a purchase price of $4.77 per share resulting in an aggregate capital raise of $7,342,967. In addition, such Hunt affiliate also purchased 710,495 of our shares from our largest shareholder, XL Investments Ltd. ("XL Investments"), for the same price per share. The purchase price per share represented a 56.9% premium over the Company's common share price as of the closing on January 17, 2018. In connection with the acquisition of shares from XL Investments, XL Investments agreed to terminate all of its previously held HCFT warrants. After completion of these share purchases, Hunt and its affiliates owned approximately 9.5% of the Company's outstanding common shares. Also in connection with the transaction, and as further described in Section 10 hereof and in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 18, 2018, David Carroll resigned as a director, Chairman and CEO of the Company and the Company's board appointed James C. ("Chris") Hunt as a director and Chairman of the board and named James P. Flynn as CEO of the Company and Michael P. Larsen as President of the Company.
Hunt CMT Equity LLC Transaction
On April 30, 2018, as more particularly described in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 30, 2018, the Company acquired Hunt CMT Equity LLC for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $68 million. The assets of Hunt CMT Equity LLC were comprised of commercial mortgage loans financed through a collateralized loan obligation ("Hunt CRE 2017-FL1, Ltd."), a licensed commercial mortgage lender ("Hunt CMT Finance, LLC") and eight loan participations from a Hunt affiliate. The assets of Hunt CRE 2017-FL1, Ltd. were comprised of performing floating-rate commercial mortgage loans with a portfolio balance of $339.4 million and $9.8 million in cash available for reinvestment at the acquisition date. The securitization pool was financed by investment-grade notes with a notional principal balance of $290.7 million and a net carrying value of $287.6 million after accounting for unamortized discount. Additionally, the Company paid $0.1 million for the assets acquired with the licensed lender and $6.2 million for the loan participations. 
Hunt CRE 2018-FL2
On August 20, 2018, the Company closed Hunt CRE 2018-FL2, Ltd., a $285 million commercial real estate collateralized loan obligation, which financed 20 first lien floating-rate commercial real estate mortgage assets acquired from Hunt Finance Company, LLC, an affiliate of the Manager. The assets of Hunt CRE 2018-FL2, Ltd. were comprised of performing floating-rate commercial mortgage loans with a portfolio balance of $225.3 million and $59.7 million in cash available for investment at the acquisition date. The securitization pool was financed by investment-grade notes with a notional principal balance of $219.4 million and net carrying value of $215.4 million after accounting for deferred financing costs.
Our Investment Strategy

Our investment strategy is to invest in debt and related instruments supported by institutional quality commercial real estate in attractive locations. Through our Manager, we draw on Hunt's extensive real estate debt platform and its established sourcing, underwriting and structuring capabilities in order to execute our investment strategy. In addition, we have access to Hunt's extensive commercial real estate expertise and real estate operating business, which provide our Manager access to market data not available to many competitors.
In furtherance of our objective to provide attractive cash flow returns over time to our investors, our investment strategy targets the following assets:


• | Transitional multi-family and other commercial real estate loans, which are floating-rate loans secured by multi-family and other commercial real estate properties that are not guaranteed by a U.S. Government sponsored entity, or securitizations backed by such loans;

1


• | Securitizations backed by multi-family mortgage loans, or Multi-Family MBS; and


• | Other mortgage-related investments, including mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs"), CMBS, other loans or securities backed by real estate, or ownership interests in real estate.

Our primary sources of income are net interest income from our investment portfolio and non-interest income from our mortgage loan-related activities. Net interest income represents the interest income we earn on investments less the expenses of funding these investments.
Our Portfolio

Transitional Multi-Family and Commercial Real Estate Loans
Today, our business is primarily focused on acquiring senior, floating rate mortgages that are secured by a first lien on multi-family or other commercial real estate properties. These investments may be in the form of whole loans, pari passu participations within mortgage loans, or other similar structures. Although acquiring senior, floating rate mortgage loans is our primary area of focus, we may also originate and acquire fixed rate loans and subordinate loans in the future. This focused lending strategy is designed to generate attractive current income while protecting shareholder capital.
The Company acquired $345.7 million in loans in the Hunt CMT Equity LLC transaction and an additional $410.9 million during 2018 for a total of $756.6 million in loans. During the year ended December 31, 2018 loan repayments totaled $201.4 million, for net fundings of $555.2 million. The following table details the overall statistics of our current loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018:

Multi-Family MBS

As of December 31, 2018, we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of one Multi-Family MBS securitization trust, the FREMF 2012-KF01 Trust, based on our ownership of all or substantially all of the most subordinated, or first-loss, tranche as well as the related control rights. The net investment in the trust is limited to the Multi-Family MBS with an aggregate carrying value of $4.8 million.
MSRs

As of December 31, 2018, the Company retained the servicing rights associated with an aggregate principal balance of $407,332,854 of residential mortgage loans that the Company had previously transferred to four residential mortgage loan securitization trusts. The carrying value of these MSRs at December 31, 2018 was $4.0 million.
Financing Strategy

We use leverage to seek to increase potential returns to our stockholders. Currently, we utilize match term collateralized loan obligations to leverage our loan portfolio. In the future we may utilize long-term warehouse repurchase agreement financing, or other financing structures. We previously financed our former investments in Agency RMBS and Non-Agency RMBS primarily through short-term borrowings structured as repurchase agreements.
Neither our organizational documents nor our investment guidelines place any limit on the maximum amount of leverage that we may use, and we are not required to maintain any particular debt-to-equity leverage ratio. We may continue to change our financing strategy and leverage without the consent of our stockholders. Generally, we seek to enter into collateralized borrowings only with institutions that are rated investment grade by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization. 
The goal of our leverage strategy is to ensure that, at all times, our investment portfolio’s leverage ratio is appropriate for the level of risk inherent in the investment portfolio and that each asset class has individual leverage targets that are appropriate for its potential price volatility.
Risk Strategy

We seek to manage our risks related to the credit quality of our assets, interest rates, liquidity, prepayment speeds and market value while providing an opportunity to stockholders to realize attractive risk-adjusted returns through ownership of our common stock.  During the second quarter of 2018, we substantially completed the previously announced reallocation of our capital into investment opportunities in commercial mortgage assets, and as a result, the risks associated with our current and future portfolio may differ meaningfully from those related to our historical investment portfolio. In particular, as of December 31, 2018, we had: (i) sold all of our remaining Agency RMBS; (ii) sold all of our remaining Non-Agency RMBS; (iii) sold all but one of our remaining Multi-Family MBS; (iv) terminated all hedging contracts (v) purchased two portfolios of floating-rate commercial mortgage loans; and (vi) we acquired one and executed another collateralized loan obligation. This may limit the comparability of our historical disclosures related to market risks with current and future disclosures relating to such risks.

To reduce the risks to our portfolio, we have previously employed, and expect to continue to employ, portfolio-wide and security-specific risk measurement and management processes in our daily operations. While changes in the fair value of our previous investments in Agency RMBS were generally not credit-related, and instead were generally subject to a greater degree of sensitivity to market and interest rate conditions, following the reallocation of our capital primarily into floating-rate commercial mortgage assets, going forward we expect to have less sensitivity to market and interest rate related risks. Our Manager's risk management tools include software and services licensed or purchased from third parties and analytical methods utilized by our Manager. These tools have not fully protected us from market risks in the past, and, particularly in light of the significant changes to our investment portfolio there can be no assurance that they will do so in the future.
Interest Rate Risk. Following the reallocation of our investment portfolio primarily into floating-rate commercial mortgage loans, our business model is such that rising interest rates will generally increase our net interest income, while declining rates will generally decrease our net interest income. As of December 31, 2018, 100% of our loans by unpaid principal balance earned a floating rate of interest and were financed with floating rate liabilities, which resulted in an amount of net equity that is positively correlated to rising interest rates. Additionally, the remaining Multi-Family MBS investment earns a floating rate of interest and is not subject to any related debt financing, which resulted in an additional amount of net equity that is positively correlated to rising interest rates.
Prepayment Risk. Prepayment risk is the risk that principal will be repaid at a different rate than anticipated, causing the return on certain investments to be less than expected. As we receive prepayments of principal on our assets, any premiums paid on such assets are amortized against interest income. In general, an increase in prepayment rates accelerates the amortization of purchase premiums, thereby reducing the interest income earned on the assets. Conversely, discounts on such assets are accreted into interest income. In general, an increase in prepayment rates accelerates the accretion of purchase discounts, thereby increasing the interest earned on the assets. All of our commercial mortgage loans were acquired at par, and accordingly we do not believe this to be a material risk for us at present.
Additionally, we are subject to prepayment risk associated with the terms of our CLOs. Due to the generally short-term nature of transitional floating-rate commercial mortgage loans, our CLOs include a reinvestment period during which principal repayments and prepayments on our commercial mortgage loans may be reinvested in similar assets, subject to meeting certain eligibility criteria. While the interest-rate spreads of our CLOs are fixed until they are repaid, the terms, including spreads, of newly originated loans are subject to uncertainty based on a variety of factors, including market and competitive conditions. To the extent that such conditions result in lower spreads on the assets in which we reinvest, we may be subject to a reduction in interest income in the future.
Credit Risk. Our commercial mortgage loans and other investments are also subject to credit risk. The performance and value of our loans and other investments depend upon the sponsor's ability to operate properties that serve as our collateral so that they produce cash flows adequate to pay interest and principal due to us. To monitor this risk, the Manager's asset management team reviews our portfolio and maintains regular contact with borrowers and local market professionals to monitor the performance of the underlying collateral, anticipate borrower, property and market issues and, to the extent necessary or appropriate, enforce our rights as lender.
Due to the substantial reallocation of our investment portfolio from RMBS, and in particular Agency RMBS, to commercial mortgage loans, we believe our exposure to this risk is likely to be higher in the future than it has been historically.

Our Manager

With effect from January 18, 2018, we became externally managed and advised by HIM. HIM is an affiliate of Hunt, a private, diversified real estate company. As our Manager, HIM implements our business strategy, performs investment advisory services and activities with respect to our assets and is responsible for performing all of our day-to-day operations. HIM is an investment adviser registered with the SEC.

On January 18, 2018, we and Oak Circle, entered into a Termination Agreement (“Termination Agreement”) pursuant to which we and Oak Circle agreed to mutually and immediately terminate that certain management agreement, dated May 16, 2012, by and between us and Oak Circle. Under the terms of the Termination Agreement, the termination of the management agreement with Oak Circle did not trigger, and Oak Circle was not paid, a termination fee by us. Hunt separately agreed to pay Oak Circle a negotiated payment in connection with the termination agreement.
Pursuant to the terms of the new management agreement, we are required to pay our Manager an annual base management fee of 1.50% of Stockholders’ Equity (as defined in the management agreement), payable quarterly (0.375% per quarter) in arrears. Starting in the first full calendar quarter following January 18, 2019, we are also required to pay our Manager a quarterly incentive fee equal to 20% of the excess of Core Earnings (as defined in the management agreement) over the product of (i) the Stockholders' Equity as of the end of such calendar quarter and (ii) 8% per annum. We are also required to reimburse our Manager for costs associated with (i) an allocable share of the costs of non-investment personnel of the Manager and its affiliates who spend all or a portion of their time managing our affairs and operations, (ii) our CFO, (iii) our general counsel, in each case based on a percentage of his time spent on the Company's affairs. In order to assist in our ongoing efforts to reduce expenses, our Manager agreed to cap such reimbursement at 1.5% of the average Stockholders’ Equity for the applicable fiscal year. We are also required to reimburse the Manager for other costs and expenses associated with our operations, including but not limited to, the costs and expenses associated with our formation and capital raising activities, rent, utilities, office furniture, equipment, machinery and other overhead type expenses, the costs of legal, accounting, auditing, tax planning and tax return preparation, consulting services and insurance. In addition, on March 18, 2019 we entered into a support agreement with our Manager, pursuant to which our Manager agreed to reduce the reimbursement cap by 25% of such cap per annum subject to such annual support not exceeding $568,000 until such support equaled approximately $1.96 million. 
Competition

We are engaged in a competitive business. In our investing activities, we compete for opportunities with a variety of institutional investors, including other REITs, specialty finance companies, public and private funds (including other funds managed by HIM and its affiliates), commercial and investment banks, commercial finance and insurance companies and other financial institutions. Several other REITs and other investment vehicles have raised significant amounts of capital, and may have investment objectives that overlap with ours, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities. Some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources, such as the U.S. Government, that are not available to us. Many of our competitors are not subject to the operating constraints associated with REIT compliance or maintenance of an exclusion from regulation under the Investment Company Act. We could face increased competition from banks due to future legislative developments, such as amendments to key provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including, provisions setting forth capital and risk retention requirements. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of loans and investments and offer more attractive pricing or other terms than we would. Furthermore, competition for investments we target may lead to decreasing yields, which may further limit our ability to generate targeted returns.
We believe access to our Manager's and Hunt's professionals and their industry expertise and relationships provide us with competitive advantages in assessing risks and determining appropriate pricing for potential investments. We believe these relationships will enable us to compete more effectively for attractive investment opportunities. However, we may not be able to achieve our business goals or expectations due to the competitive risks that we face.
Taxation

We elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our short taxable year ended December 31, 2012, and comply with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code, with respect thereto. Accordingly, we are generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax on our REIT taxable income that we currently distribute to our stockholders so long as we maintain our qualification as a REIT. Our continued qualification as a REIT depends on our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, various complex requirements under the Internal Revenue Code relating to, among other things, the source of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the concentration of ownership of our capital stock. Even if we maintain our qualification as a REIT, we may be subject to some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income.
Taxable income generated by our TRS, which includes excess inclusion income to the extent generated by our CLOs, is subject to regular corporate income tax. For the fiscal year 2018, our TRS generated taxable income of $1.0 million which was offset by net operating losses.
 Qualification as a REIT 

Continued qualification as a REIT requires that we satisfy a variety of tests relating to our income, assets, distributions and ownership. The significant tests are summarized below.

Income Tests. In order to maintain our REIT qualification, we must satisfy two gross income requirements on an annual basis. First, at least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year, excluding gross income from sales of inventory or dealer property in “prohibited transactions” (as defined herein), discharge of indebtedness and certain hedging transactions, generally must be derived from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property, including interest income derived from mortgage loans secured by real property (including certain types of mortgage-backed securities), rents from real property, dividends received from other REITs, and gains from the sale of designated real estate assets, as well as specified income from temporary investments. Second, at least 95% of our gross income in each taxable year, excluding gross income from “prohibited transactions”, discharge of indebtedness and certain hedging transactions, must be derived from some combination of income that qualifies under the 75% gross income test described above, as well as other dividends, interest, and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities, which need not have any relation to real property. Income and gain from certain hedging transactions will be excluded from both the numerator and the denominator for purposes of both the 75% and 95% gross income tests. In 2018, the Company failed the 75% gross income test as a result of gains generated from the termination of hedges associated with the disposition of the Agency RMBS portfolio during 2018. The Company accrued a tax liability of $1.96 million for 2018 as a result of its failure of the 75% gross income test. The Company in consultation with its new external tax advisor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, requested a pre-filing agreement from the IRS concerning the application of Section 856(c)(6) of the Code, a statutory relief provision. The Company believes it more likely than not that its REIT election will not be impacted.

Asset Tests. At the close of each calendar quarter, we must also satisfy five tests relating to the nature of our assets. First, at least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by some combination of designated real estate assets, cash, cash items, U.S. Government securities and, under some circumstances, stock or debt instruments purchased with new capital. Second, the value of any one issuer’s securities that we own may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets. Third, we may not own more than 10% of any one issuer’s outstanding securities, as measured by either value (the “10% of value asset test”) or voting power. The 5% and 10% asset tests do not apply to securities that qualify under the 75% asset test or to securities of a TRS and qualified REIT subsidiaries, and the 10% of value asset test does not apply to “straight debt” having specified characteristics and to certain other securities. Fourth, the aggregate value of all securities of TRSs that we hold may not exceed 20% of the value of our total assets. Fifth, not more than 25% of the value of our total assets may be represented by debt instruments of publicly offered REITs to the extent those debt instruments would not be real estate assets but for the inclusion of debt instruments of publicly offered REITs in the meaning of real estate assets.

4

Distribution Requirements. In order to maintain our REIT qualification, we are required to distribute dividends, other than capital gain dividends, to our stockholders in an amount at least equal to: (1) the sum of (a) 90% of our REIT taxable income computed without regard to our net capital gains and the deduction for dividends paid, and (b) 90% of our net income, if any, (after tax) from foreclosure property; minus (2) the sum of specified items of non-cash income that exceeds a certain percentage of our income.

Ownership. In order to maintain our REIT status, we must not be deemed to be closely held and must have more than 100 shareholders. The closely held prohibition requires that not more than 50% of the value of our outstanding shares be owned by five or fewer “individuals” (as defined for this purpose to include certain trusts and foundations) during the last half of our taxable year. The “more than 100 shareholders” rule requires that we have at least 100 shareholders for at least 335 days of a taxable year. Failure to satisfy either of these rules would cause us to fail to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT unless certain relief provisions are available.
