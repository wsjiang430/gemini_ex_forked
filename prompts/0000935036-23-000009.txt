ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
ACI develops, markets, installs, and supports a broad line of software products and solutions primarily focused on facilitating real-time digital payments. ACI’s enterprise payments capabilities target any channel, any network, and any payment type and our solutions empower customers to regain control, choice, and flexibility in today’s complex payments environment, get to market more quickly, and reduce operational costs.
ACI's solutions and services are used globally by banks, intermediaries, merchants and billers, such as third-party digital payment processors, payment associations, switch interchanges and a wide range of transaction-generating endpoints, including automated teller machines (“ATM”), merchant point-of-sale (“POS”) terminals, bank branches, mobile phones, tablets, corporations, and internet commerce sites. The authentication, authorization, switching, settlement, fraud-checking, and reconciliation of digital payments is a complex activity due to the large number of locations and variety of sources from which transactions can be generated, the large number of participants in the market, high transaction volumes, geographically dispersed networks, differing types of authorization, and varied reporting requirements. These activities are typically performed online and are conducted 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
ACI combines a global perspective with local presence to tailor digital payment solutions for our customers. We believe that we have one of the most diverse and robust digital payment solution portfolios in the industry with application software spanning the entire payments value chain. We also believe that our financial performance has been attributable to our ability to design and deliver quality products and solutions coupled with our ability to identify and successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions.
ACI is a Delaware corporation incorporated in November 1993 under the name ACI Holding, Inc. We are largely the successor to Applied Communications, Inc. and Applied Communications Inc. Limited, acquired from Tandem Computers Incorporated on December 31, 1993. On July 24, 2007, we changed our corporate name from “Transaction Systems Architects, Inc.” to “ACI Worldwide, Inc.” We have been marketing our products and services under the ACI Worldwide brand since 1993 and have gained significant market recognition under this brand name.
Fiscal 2022 Divestiture
Corporate Online Banking Solutions
On September 1, 2022, we sold our corporate online banking solutions related assets and liabilities to One Equity Partners for $100.1 million, including a preliminary net working capital adjustment. The sale included employees and customer contracts as well as technology assets and intellectual property.
Target Markets
ACI’s comprehensive digital payment solutions serve three key markets:
Banks
ACI provides payment solutions to large and mid-size banks globally for both retail banking, digital, and other payment services. Our solutions transform banks’ complex payment environments to speed time to market, reduce costs, and deliver a consistent experience to customers across channels while enabling them to prevent and rapidly react to fraudulent activity. In addition, we enable banks to meet the requirements of different real-time payment schemes and to quickly create differentiated products to meet consumer, business, and merchant demands.
ACI’s payment solutions support intermediaries, such as processors, networks, payment service providers (“PSPs”), and new financial technology ("fintech") entrants. We offer these customers scalable solutions that strategically position them to innovate and achieve growth and cost efficiency, while protecting them against fraud. Our solutions also allow new entrants in the digital marketplace to access innovative payment schemes, such as the U.K. Faster Payments New Access Model, Singapore FAST, India Unified Payments Interface ("UPI"), the Payments Network Malaysia ("PayNet"), Real-time Retail Payments Platform ("RPP"), and others.
Merchants
ACI’s support of merchants globally includes Tier 1 and Tier 2 merchants, online-only merchants and the PSPs, independent selling organizations (“ISOs”), value-added resellers (“VARs”), and acquirers who service them. These customers operate in a variety of verticals, including general merchandise, grocery, hospitality, dining, transportation, and others. Our solutions provide merchants with a secure, omni-channel payments platform that gives them independence from third-party payment providers. We also offer secure solutions to online-only merchants that provide consumers with a convenient and seamless way to shop.
Billers
Within the biller segment, ACI provides electronic bill presentment and payment (“EBPP”) services to companies operating in the consumer finance, insurance, healthcare, higher education, utility, government, mortgage, subscription providers, and telecommunications categories. Our solutions enable these customers to support a wide range of payment options and provide a convenient consumer payments experience that drives consumer loyalty and increases revenue.
Solutions
ACI is a global leader in mission-critical, real-time payments software. Our proven, secure, and scalable software solutions enable corporations, fintechs, and financial disruptors to process and manage digital payments, power omni-commerce payments, present and process bill payments, and manage fraud and risk.

ACI Speedpay® is an integrated suite of digital billing, payment, disbursement, and communication services that lowers the cost of presenting and accepting bill payments while delivering industry-leading security.
On Premise, On Demand, or Hybrid Software Delivery Options
Our software solutions are offered to customers through either a traditional term software license arrangement where the software is installed and operated on the customer premises or in a cloud environment, through an on-demand arrangement where the solution is maintained and delivered through the public cloud or ACI's private cloud via our global data centers, or a combination of the two based upon customers' unique needs. Solutions delivered through ACI’s on-demand cloud are available in either a single-tenant environment, known as a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) offering, or in a multi-tenant environment, known as a Platform-as-a-Service (“PaaS”) offering. Pricing and payment terms depend on which solutions the customer requires and their transaction volumes. Generally, customers are required to commit to a minimum contract of five years, or three years in the case of certain acquired SaaS and PaaS contracts.
Partnerships and Industry Participation
We have two major types of third-party product partners: 1) technology partners, or industry leaders with whom we work closely that drive key industry trends and mandates, and 2) business partners, with whom we embed the partners’ technology in ACI products, host the partners’ software in ACI’s cloud as a part of our cloud offerings, or jointly market solutions that include the products of the other company.
Technology partners help us add value to our solutions and stay abreast of current market conditions and industry developments such as standards. Technology partners include organizations such as Diebold Nixdorf (“Diebold”), NCR Corporation (“NCR”), Visa, Mastercard, and SWIFT. In addition, ACI has membership in or participates in the relevant committees of several industry associations, such as the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”), Accredited Standards Committee ("ASC") X9, ATM Industry Association ("ATMIA"), Financial Services, Nexo Standards, U.K. Cards Association, U.S. Payments Forum, and the PCI Security Standards Council. These partnerships provide direction as it relates to the specifications that are used in real-time payment standards, by card schemes, and, in some cases, by hardware vendors. These organizations typically look to ACI as a source of knowledge and experience that can inform their work to create and enhance standards. The partnerships provide us the opportunity to influence these standards with concepts and ideas that will benefit the market, our customers, and ACI.
Business partner relationships extend our product portfolio, improve our ability to get our solutions to market, and enhance our ability to deliver market-leading solutions. We share revenues with these business partners based on several factors related to overall value contribution in the delivery of the joint solution or payment type. The agreements with business partners include referral, resale, traditional original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) relationships, and transaction fee-based payment-enablement partnerships. These agreements generally grant ACI the right to create an integrated solution that we host or distribute, or provide ACI access to established payment networks or capabilities. The agreements are generally worldwide in scope and have a term of several years.
We have alliances with our technology partners Amazon, HPE, IBM, Microsoft Corporation, and Oracle USA, Inc. (“Oracle”), whose industry-leading hardware, software, and cloud-based infrastructure services are utilized by and in delivery of ACI’s products. These partnerships allow us to understand developments in the partners’ technology and to utilize their expertise in topics like sizing, scalability, and performance testing.
Services
We offer our customers a wide range of professional services, including consultation, analysis, design, development, implementation, integration, testing, and project management. Our service professionals generally perform the majority of the work associated with implementing and integrating our software solutions. In addition, we work with a number of trained global and regional systems integration and services partners for staff augmentation and coordinated co-prime delivery where appropriate.
Product support services are available to customers after a solution has been installed and are based on the relevant product support category. An extensive team of support analysts are available to assist customers.
In addition, we provide education services to ACI customers to enhance and improve their understanding of our products. This learning is made available through the ACI Training Academy, which offers flexible, powerful training in multiple formats: self-paced eLearning, instructor-led courses and hands-on virtual training. Our interactive, self-paced eLearning is available on demand via our online learning management system. ACI instructor-led courses include both theory and practical sessions to allow students to work though real business scenarios and put their newly learned skills to use. This hands-on approach ensures that the knowledge is retained, and the student is more productive upon their return to the workplace. ACI also provides further, more in-depth technical courses that allow students to use practical labs to enhance what they have learned in the classroom. Training services are frequently a blended part of implementation services, enabling learning to occur in the right phase of the project lifecycle. Training from ACI Training Academy is available throughout the customer lifecycle to address ongoing or changing business needs. Depending on the products owned and course selected, training is conducted either at a dedicated education facility at one of ACI’s offices, online, on demand or at the customer site.
Customer Support
ACI provides our customers with product support that is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We offer our customers two support options:
Standard Customer Support. After implementation completion, we provide maintenance services to customers for a monthly product support fee. Maintenance services include:
•New product releases (major, minor and patches) for active products
•24-hour hotline for priority one (“P1”) problem resolutions
•Access to our online support portal (eSupport)
•Vendor-required mandates and updates
•Product documentation
Premium Customer Support. Under the premium customer support option, referred to as the Premium Customer Support Program and available at additional cost, customers are provided support beyond the standard offering. The services available may differ by product and are defined in the customer contract.
We provide new releases of our products on a periodic basis. New releases of our products, which often contain minor product enhancements, are typically provided at no additional fee for customers under standard customer support agreements. Agreements with our customers permit us to charge for substantial product enhancements that are not provided as part of the standard or premium customer support agreement.
Competition
The digital payments market is highly competitive and subject to rapid change. Competitive factors affecting the market for our solutions, products, and services include product features, price, availability of customer support, ease of implementation, product and company reputation, and a commitment to continued investment in research and development.
Our competitors vary by solution, geography, and market segment. Generally, our most significant competition comes from in-house information technology departments of existing and potential customers, as well as third-party digital payment processors (some of whom are our customers). Many of these companies are significantly larger than us and have significantly greater financial, technical, and marketing resources.

The user groups are generally organized geographically or by product lines. We believe that the timely development of new applications and enhancements is essential to maintaining our competitive position in the market.
During the development of new products and solutions, we work closely with our customers and industry leaders to determine requirements. We work with device manufacturers, such as Diebold, NCR, and Wincor-Nixdorf, to ensure compatibility with the latest ATM technology. We work with network vendors, such as Mastercard, SWIFT, and Visa, to ensure compliance with new regulations or processing mandates. We work with computer hardware and software manufacturers, such as HPE, IBM, Microsoft Corporation, and Oracle, to ensure compatibility with new operating system releases and generations of hardware. Customers often provide additional information on requirements and serve as beta-test partners.
We have a continuous process to encourage and capture innovative product ideas. Such ideas include features, as well as entirely new products or service offerings. A proof of concept (“POC”) may be conducted to validate the idea. If determined to be viable, the innovation is scheduled into a product roadmap for development and release.
Customers
We provide software products and solutions to our banks, intermediary, and merchants customers worldwide. Our biller products and solutions are sold in the United States. As of December 31, 2022, we serve more than 6,000 organizations, including 9 of the top 10 banks worldwide and 80,000+ merchants directly and through payment service providers, as measured by revenue, in 95+ countries on six continents. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. One customer accounted for 10.1% and 13.8% of the Company's consolidated receivables balance as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.
Selling and Implementation
Our products are sold and supported directly and through distribution networks covering three geographic regions – the Americas, Europe/Middle East/Africa ("EMEA") and Asia Pacific. Each region has its own globally coordinated sales force, supplemented with local independent reseller and/or distributor networks. Our primary method of distribution is direct sales by employees assigned to specific target customer segments. We use distributors and referral partners to supplement our direct sales force in countries where it is more efficient and economical to do so. 
Headquartered in Coral Gables, Florida, we have sales and services personnel in offices throughout the United States. Outside of the United States, our international subsidiaries sell, support, and service our products and solutions in their local countries. 
ACI’s distributors, resellers, and system integration partners are enabled to provide supplemental or complete product implementation and customization services directly to our customers or in a joint delivery model. Our broad geographic footprint allows us to leverage the business and technical expertise of a global workforce.
We distribute the products of other vendors where they complement our existing product lines. We are typically responsible for the sales and marketing of the vendor’s products, and agreements with these vendors generally provide for revenue sharing based on relative responsibilities.
Proprietary Rights and Licenses
We rely on a combination of trade secret and copyright laws, license agreements, contractual provisions, and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We distribute our software products under software license agreements that typically grant customers nonexclusive licenses to use our products. Use of our software products is usually restricted to designated computers, specified locations and/or specified capacity, and is subject to terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized reproduction or transfer of our software products. We also seek to protect the source code of our software as a trade secret and as a copyrighted work. Despite these precautions, there can be no assurance that misappropriation of our software products and technology will not occur.
In addition to our own products, we distribute, or act as a sales agent for, software developed by third parties. However, we typically are not involved in the development process used by these third parties. Our rights to those third-party products and the associated intellectual property rights are limited by the terms of the contractual agreement between us and the respective third party.
Although we believe that our owned and licensed intellectual property rights do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us. Further, there can be no assurance that intellectual property protection will be available for our products in all foreign countries.
Government Regulation
Certain of our solutions are subject to federal, state, and foreign regulations and requirements.
Oversight by Banking Regulators. As a provider of payment services to banks and intermediaries, we are subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”), an interagency body of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the National Credit Union Administration and various state regulatory authorities as part of the Multi-Region Data Processing Servicer Program (“MDPS”). The MDPS program includes technology suppliers who provide mission critical applications for a large number of financial institutions that are regulated by multiple regulatory agencies. Periodic information technology examination assessments are performed using FFIEC interagency guidelines to identify potential risks that could adversely affect serviced financial institutions, determine compliance with applicable laws and regulations that affect the services provided to financial institutions and ensure the services we provide to financial institutions do not create systemic risk to the banking system or impact the safe and sound operation of the financial institutions we serve. In addition, independent 
auditors annually review several of our operations to provide reports on internal controls for our clients’ auditors and regulators. We are also subject to review under state and foreign laws and rules that regulate many of the same activities that are described above, including electronic data processing and back-office services for financial institutions and the use of consumer information.
Money Transfer. ACI Payments, Inc., our EBPP affiliate, is registered as a Money Services Business. Accordingly, we are subject to the USA Patriot Act and reporting requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act and United States ("U.S."). Treasury Regulations. These businesses may also be subject to certain state and local licensing requirements. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”), state attorneys general, and other agencies have enforcement responsibility over laws relating to money laundering, currency transmission, and licensing. In addition, most states have enacted statutes that require entities engaged in money transmission to register as a money transmitter with that jurisdiction’s banking department. We have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with all applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations. ACI has also implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with the regulations and economic sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), which enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries, entities and individuals based on external threats to the U.S. foreign policy, national security, or economy; by other governments; or by global or regional multilateral organizations, such as the United Nations Security Council and the European Union as applicable.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we had 3,349 employees worldwide, with 1,516 employees in the Americas, 952 employees in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA"), and 881 employees in Asia Pacific. ACI emphasizes a diverse and inclusive workplace, with approximately 40 sites in over 30 countries. Globally, 34% of our employees are women. We are committed to ensuring employees feel safe and respected, regardless of race, color, age, gender, disability, minority, sexual orientation, or any other protected class. Employees have the ability to challenge themselves and continue to grow through various assignments, projects, and development programs. We strive to offer competitive salaries and benefits to all employees, and we continuously monitor salary ranges in our market areas.
Retention
Our voluntary regrettable turnover, or our turnover of high performers, through December 31, 2022 was 12%, which compares favorably to industry turnover rates. We are pleased with our retention and will continue to employ strategies to retain and engage our global employees. 
Benefits
We provide our global employees with competitive and comprehensive benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their dependents. 
In the United States, nearly all of our employees participate in our employee benefits programs that include:

•Flexible spending accounts for medical and dependent care expenses

Globally, all employees have access to an employee assistance program which offers support to employees and their immediate family to address a range of personal needs and concerns in support of their well-being and mental health. 
To foster a stronger sense of ownership and align with the interests of our shareholders, participation in the employee stock purchase plan is available for eligible employees.
