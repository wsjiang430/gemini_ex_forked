Item 1. Business
Our Company
 
MTBC, Inc., formerly known as Medical Transcription Billing, Corp., together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company”), is a healthcare information technology company that provides a suite of proprietary web-based solutions and business services to healthcare providers. Our integrated Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) platform and business services are designed to help our clients increase revenues, streamline workflows and make better business and clinical decisions, while reducing administrative burdens and operating costs. These solutions and services include:

● | Revenue cycle management (“RCM”) services, which include end-to-end medical billing, eligibility, analytics, and related services, all of which can be provided either with our technology platform or through a third-party system; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Proprietary healthcare IT solutions, which are part of our RCM services, including: 


Electronic health records (“EHR”), which are easy to use, integrated with our business services and allow our healthcare provider clients to reduce paperwork and qualify for incentives; 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Practice management software and related tools, which support our clients’ day-to-day business operations and workflows; 
Mobile Health (“mHealth”) solutions, including smartphone applications that assist patients and healthcare providers in the provision of healthcare services; 
Healthcare claims clearinghouse, which enables our clients to electronically scrub and submit claims to, and process payments from, insurance companies; and 
Business intelligence, customized applications, interfaces and a variety of other technology solutions that support our healthcare clients; 


● | Group purchasing services which include our negotiation of discounts with pharmaceutical manufacturers and the extension of those discounts to our physician members; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Comprehensive practice management services, which are offered under long-term management service agreements pursuant to which we provide certain practices with the administrative support, facilities, supplies, equipment, marketing, RCM, accounting, and other non-clinical services required to efficiently operate their practices. 

 
We are able to deliver our industry-leading solutions at very competitive prices because we leverage a combination of our proprietary software, which automates our workflows and increases efficiency, together with our team of over 350 experienced health industry experts throughout the United States. These experts who are supported by our highly educated and specialized offshore workforce of approximately 2,000 team members at labor costs that we believe are approximately one-tenth the cost of comparable U.S. employees. Our unique business model also allowed us to become a leading consolidator in our industry sector, gaining us a reputation for acquiring and positively transforming distressed competitors into profitable operations of MTBC.
 
During July 2018, the Company acquired substantially all of the revenue cycle management, practice management and group purchasing assets of Orion Healthcorp, Inc. and 13 of its affiliates (together “Orion”). The Company paid $12.6 million in cash for the acquisition. This acquisition expanded the scope of our offerings to include additional niche hospital solutions, a service that negotiates vaccine discounts with pharmaceutical manufacturers and then extends those vaccine discounts to its physician members, and a service that provides end-to-end practice management services to physician practices under multi-decade management service agreements.
 
Adoption of our RCM solutions requires little or no upfront expenditure by a client. Additionally, for most of our solutions and customers, our financial performance is linked directly to the financial performance of our clients, as the vast majority of our revenues are based on a percentage of our clients’ collections. The standard fee for our complete, integrated, end-to-end solution is among the lowest in the industry. We estimate that we currently provide services to more than 10,000 providers, (which we define as physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and other clinical staff that render bills for their services) practicing in approximately 1,800 independent medical practices and hospitals, representing 79 specialties and subspecialties in 43 states. In addition, we served approximately 200 clients which are not medical practices, but are primarily service organizations who serve the healthcare community. The foregoing numbers include clients leveraging any of our products or services, and are based in part upon estimates where the precise number of practices or providers is unknown.

We service clients ranging from small practices, consisting of one to ten providers, to community hospitals. Our customer which generates the largest revenue for us has over 1,300 providers of physical, occupational and speech therapy services to patients in multiple states.
 
On July 23, 2014, the Company completed its initial public offering (“IPO”) of common stock. The Company sold approximately four million shares at a price to the public of $5.00 per share.
 
In November 2015, the Company completed a public offering of its 11% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”). The Company sold 231,616 shares at a price of $25.00 per share and received net proceeds of approximately $4.7 million. In July 2016, the Company sold an additional 63,040 shares of Preferred Stock and received net proceeds of approximately $1.3 million. In 2017, the Company raised a total of $16.4 million in net proceeds from a series of additional offerings totaling approximately 765,000 shares of Preferred Stock, all at $25.00 per share. In May 2017, the Company completed a registered direct offering of one million shares of its common stock at $2.30 per share, raising net proceeds of approximately $2.0 million. During 2018, the Company issued 1,020,000 shares of Preferred Stock and received net proceeds of approximately $22.8 million.
 
During 2016, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets of four medical billing companies, Gulf Coast Billing, Inc., Renaissance Medical Billing, LLC and WFS Services, Inc. As part of the transaction, the Company acquired a mailing service operation from WFS Services, Inc. In addition, the Company also purchased substantially all of the assets of MediGain, LLC, including its subsidiary Millennium Practice Management Associates, LLC and two offshore subsidiaries in India and Sri Lanka through MTBC’s wholly owned subsidiary, MTBC Acquisition, Corp.
 
In 2017, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets of Washington Medical Billing, LLC, another medical billing company.
 
In 2018, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets of Orion, through MTBC’s wholly owned subsidiaries MTBC Health, Inc. and MTBC Practice Management, Corp.
 
On February 6, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to MTBC, Inc.
 
Employees
 
Including the employees of our subsidiaries, as of January 2019, the Company employed approximately 2,400 people worldwide on a full-time basis. We also utilize the services of a small number of part time employees. In addition, all officers of the Company work on a full-time basis. Over the next twelve months, we anticipate increasing our total number of employees only if our revenues increase or our operating requirements warrant such hiring, or for specific functions where we place additional emphasis, such as marketing and sales.
Our Growth Strategy
 
The RCM service industry is highly fragmented, with many local and regional RCM companies serving small medical practices and hospitals. We believe that the industry is ripe for consolidation and that we can achieve significant growth through acquisitions. We further believe that it is becoming increasingly difficult for traditional RCM companies to meet the growing technology and business service needs of healthcare providers without a significant investment in an information technology infrastructure. Since the Company went public in July 2014, we have acquired substantially all of the assets of 11 RCM companies. Although the specific arrangements have varied with each transaction, typical arrangements include a discounted price, consideration which is sometimes tied to revenues from the customer relationships acquired, and structuring the acquisition as an asset purchase so as to limit our liability. We typically leverage our technology and our cost-effective offshore team to reduce costs promptly after the transaction closes, although there will be initial costs associated with the integration of the acquired business with our existing operations.

We believe we can further accelerate organic growth through industry participants, whereby in addition to obtaining referrals, we utilize them as channel partners to offer integrated solutions to their clients. We have entered into such arrangements with industry participants, and from which we began to derive revenue from them starting in mid-2014. We have developed application interfaces with numerous EHR systems, together with device and lab integration to support these relationships.
 
During 2017, we started to realize the benefits of our investment in organic growth initiatives. In late 2017, we signed a 950 clinician practice that provides physical, occupational and speech therapy services to patients across multiple states. This client has grown in the time since signing with MTBC and is currently our largest client as measured by monthly revenue and provider count.
 
During 2018, we completed our largest acquisition of Orion, adding approximately $17.8 million of revenue for the year. In addition to revenue cycle management, after the Orion acquisition we earned approximately 19% of our revenue from practice management services, which represents fees based on our actual costs plus a percentage of the operating profit. We also earned approximately 2% of our revenue from group purchasing services.
 
Industry Overview
 
In February 2019, the Centers for Medicare and Medical Services (“CMS”) estimated that U.S. healthcare spending increased by 3.9% to reach nearly $3.5 trillion. CMS also projected that U.S healthcare spending will grow 5.5% annually on average during years 2019 through 2027, reaching $6.0 trillion by 2027. CMS also projected that health spending will grow 0.8% point faster than Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”) annually during the years 2019 through 2027; and as a result, the health share of GDP is expected to rise from 17.9% in 2017 to 19.4% by 2027.
 
Increasingly complex reimbursement processes. New laws and payer requirements have further complicated insurance reimbursement processes. For example, Medicare, Medicaid and commercial insurances are increasingly requiring proof of adherence to best practices and improved patient health outcomes to support full reimbursement. Moreover, the recent shift to a new generation of insurance codes has dramatically increased the complexity associated with selecting appropriate procedure and diagnosis codes needed to support proper claim submission and reimbursement.
 
Movement toward healthcare information technology. Since 2011, the federal government has offered financial incentives to eligible healthcare providers who adopt and meaningfully use EHR technology. Beginning in 2015, providers who are not meaningfully using this technology began to incur penalties, which increase over time. While these incentives and penalties have encouraged many providers to adopt and meaningfully use EHR software, we believe that most providers are not utilizing an integrated platform that combines practice management, business intelligence, and revenue cycle management. The lack of an integrated platform leaves them ill-equipped to address the multitude of rapidly growing industry challenges and government mandates.
 
The United States RCM market has been estimated by Grand View Research to be approximately $11 billion in 2017, growing at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 11.2% per year for the forecast period from 2019 through 2025. The North American EHR market has been estimated by Transparency Market Research to be approximately $11 billion in 2017, growing at a CAGR of 5.7% per year for the forecast period of 2017 through 2025. Standalone billing and practice management solutions are reported to be declining in the market today as medical practices move towards integrated, end-to-end systems that incorporate front and back office data flows, provide seamless access to clinical data from EHRs, and streamline the entire revenue cycle management process.
 
Shift in focus to preventive care. In an effort to avoid the negative health effects and increased costs associated with undetected and untreated chronic conditions, most health insurance plans provide co-payment and deductible-free coverage for preventive health services, such as annual well visits. Many believe that this shift in focus will, in the long-term, reduce costs and improve patient health. Effective preventative health services require access to comprehensive medical records that are readily available to primary care physicians and other physicians providing preventative healthcare.
 
Inaccessibility of critical data. To thrive in the emerging healthcare landscape, healthcare practices need timely information, such as health insurance plan eligibility and coverage details, provider performance and productivity data, as well as clinical and reimbursement benchmarking. However, we believe that most small and medium size practices do not have access to this type of real-time data, business intelligence and analytical tools and thus struggle to efficiently operate their practices and make optimal decisions.

Competition
 
The market for practice management, EHR and RCM information solutions and related services is highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. We face competition from other providers of both integrated and stand-alone practice management, EHR and RCM solutions, including competitors who utilize a web-based platform and providers of locally installed software systems. Our competitors also include larger healthcare IT companies, such as athenahealth, Inc., Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc., eClinicalWorks and Greenway Medical Technologies, Inc.
 
Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition and greater financial, marketing and other resources than MTBC. We also compete with various regional RCM companies, some of which may continue to consolidate and expand into broader markets. We expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of incentives provided by various governmental initiatives, and consolidation in both the information technology and healthcare industries. In addition, our competitive edge could be diminished or completely lost if our competition develops similar offshore operations in Pakistan or other countries, such as India and the Philippines, where labor costs are lower than those in the U.S. (although higher than in Pakistan). Pricing pressures could negatively impact our margins, growth rate and market share.
 
Our Solution
 
We believe that our fully integrated solutions uniquely address the challenges in the industry. Our solutions dramatically simplify the complexities inherent in the claim reimbursement process and thereby deliver objectively superior results, such as reduced claim denial rates, improved customer days in accounts receivable, reduced patient no-shows, increased well visit encounters and reimbursement. Our solutions empower our customers with the real-time data they need to be efficient and make better decisions, such as real-time insurance eligibility and deductible details, provider productivity details and payer benchmarking.
 
Our fully integrated suite of technology and business service solutions is designed to enable healthcare practices to thrive in the midst of a rapidly changing environment in which managing reimbursement, clinical workflows and day-to-day administrative tasks are becoming increasingly complex, costly and time-consuming. Moreover, in most cases the standard fee for our complete, integrated, end-to-end solution is based upon a percentage of a practice’s healthcare-related revenues, with a monthly minimum fee, plus a nominal one-time setup fee, and is among the lowest in the industry.
 
Our Business Strategy
 
Our objective is to become the leading provider of integrated, end-to-end SaaS and business service solutions to healthcare providers practicing in an ambulatory setting. To achieve this objective, we employ the following strategies:

● | Provide comprehensive practice management, electronic health records, revenue cycle management and mobile health solutions to small and medium size healthcare practices and hospitals. We believe that providers are in need of an integrated, end-to-end solution, such as the solution that MTBC provides, to manage the different facets of their businesses, from clinical documentation to claim submission and financial reporting. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Provide exceptional customer service. We realize that our success is tied directly to our customers’ success. Accordingly, a substantial portion of our highly trained and educated workforce is devoted to customer service. 
● | Leverage significant cost advantages provided by our technology and skilled offshore workforce. Our unique business model includes our web-based software and a cost-effective offshore workforce primarily based in Pakistan. We believe that this operating model provides us with significant cost advantages compared to other revenue cycle management companies and it allows us to significantly reduce the operational costs of the companies we acquire. 
● | Pursue strategic acquisitions. Approximately 70% of our current practices and 70% of our current year’s revenue were obtained through strategic transactions with revenue cycle management companies. With most of our acquisition transactions, our goal is to retain the acquired customers over the long-term and migrate those customers to our platform soon after closing.

Our Service Offerings
 
Healthcare IT:
 
We offer a suite of fully-integrated, web-based SaaS platform solutions and business services designed for healthcare providers. Our products and services offer healthcare providers a unified solution designed to meet the healthcare industry’s demand for the delivery of cost-efficient, quality care with measureable outcomes. The four primary components of our proprietary web-based suite of services are: (i) practice management applications, (ii) a certified electronic health records solution, (iii) revenue cycle management services, and (iv) mobile health applications.
 
Our flagship product, PracticePro®, provides our clients with a seamlessly integrated, end-to-end solution. Our web-based EHR is also available to customers as a standalone product. We regularly update our software platform with the goal of staying on the leading edge of industry developments, payer reimbursements trends and new regulations.
 
Web-based practice management application
 
Our proprietary, web-based practice management application automates the labor-intensive workflow of a medical office in a unified and streamlined SaaS platform. The various functions of the platform collectively support the entire workflow of the day-to-day operations of a medical office in an intuitive and user-friendly format. For example, our platform provides office staff with real-time insurance details to allow them to more efficiently collect patient payments; its automated appointment reminders reduce patient no-show rates, and scheduling functionality results in increased reimbursable patient well visit appointments. A simple, individual and secure login to our web-based platform gives physicians, other healthcare providers and staff members’ access to a vast array of real time practice management data which they can access at the office or from any other location where they can access the Internet. Users can customize the “Practice Dashboard” to display only the most useful and relevant information needed to carry out their particular functions. We believe that this streamlined and centralized automated workflow allows providers to focus on delivering quality patient care rather than office administration.
 
Electronic health records
 
Our web-based EHR solution has received ONC-ACB Health Information Technology certification. Moreover, in a previous study, KLAS, a leading independent industry assessor of healthcare information technology products, issued its annual electronic health records ranking and MTBC’s legacy EHR placed fifth in our target market of one to ten providers, outperforming most leading electronic health records. Our web-based EHR allows a provider to view all patient information in one online location. Utilizing EHR, providers can track patients from their initial appointments; chart clinical data, history, and other personal information; enter and submit claims for medical services; and review and respond to queries for additional information regarding the billing process. Additionally, the EHR software delivers a robust document management system to enable providers to transition to paperless environments. The document management function makes available electronic connectivity between practitioners and patients, thereby streamlining patient care coordination and communications. In 2015, we introduced a tablet-based EHR, leveraging our web-based platform in a form that many providers find more convenient. During the third quarter of 2017, the Company introduced talkEHR™, a voice enabled EHR solution.
 
Revenue cycle management and other technology-driven business services
 
Our proprietary revenue cycle management offering is designed to improve the medical billing reimbursement process, allowing healthcare providers to accelerate and increase collections, reduce errors in submission and streamline workflow to free up practitioners to focus on patient care. Customers using PracticePro® will generally see higher claims acceptance and resolution, and faster collections. Our revenue cycle management service employs a proprietary rules-based system designed and constantly updated by our knowledgeable workforce, who screens and scrubs claims prior to submission for payment.

Mobile health solutions
 
The functionality of our cloud-based platform is extended to mobile devices through our integrated suite of mobile health applications. These mobile health applications include physician end-user tools that support, among other things, electronic prescribing, the capture of billing charges in the current medical coding formats, and the creation and secure transfer of clinical audio notes that are converted into text and billing charges. In 2015, we introduced an ICD-10 mHealth app for iOS and Android, which has emerged as the most popular ICD-10 app among U.S. healthcare providers. We also offer iCheckIn, a patient check-in app for iOS and Android-based tablet devices. Our patient applications allow patients to access their medical information, securely communicate with their doctors’ office, schedule appointments, request prescription refills, pay balances and check-in for office appointments.
 
Practice management:
 
We offer comprehensive practice management services to physicians where we provide the medical practice with appropriate facilities, equipment, supplies, support services and administrative support staff. We also provide management, bill-paying and financial advisory services. The Company’s fees are based on the operating results of the practice.
 
Voting Rights of Our Directors, Executive Officers, and Principal Stockholders
 
As of December 31, 2018, approximately 50% of both the shares of our common stock and voting power of our common stock are held by our directors and executive officers. Therefore, they have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of our directors, as well as the overall management and direction of our company.
