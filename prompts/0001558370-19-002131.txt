 Overview 
 We are a growing diagnostics company with proprietary molecular and bioinformatics technology that we are deploying to change the management of disease worldwide. Our novel molecular assays reliably measure many informative regions across the genome from samples as small as a single cell. Our statistical algorithms combine these measurements with data available from the broader scientific community to identify genetic variations covering a wide range of serious conditions with best-in-class accuracy and coverage. Our goal is to develop and commercialize non- or minimally- invasive tests to evaluate risk, and thereby enable early detection, for a wide range of genetic conditions, such as Down syndrome, as well as cancer and organ transplant rejection. Our technology has been proven clinically and commercially in the prenatal testing space. We have begun translating this success into the liquid biopsy space, where we are leveraging our core expertise to develop products for oncology diagnostic applications, initially for research use and which we are developing as a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, test. We have also begun to develop products for applications in organ transplant rejection. We seek to enable even wider adoption of our technology through our global cloud-based distribution model. In addition to our direct sales force in the United States, we have a global network of over 100 laboratory and distribution partners, including many of the largest international laboratories. 
 Since 2009, we have launched a comprehensive suite of ten products in reproductive health—nine molecular diagnostic tests and a newborn stem cell banking offering to complement our prenatal testing portfolio—and our personalized liquid biopsy technology for research use only in oncology applications. We are currently working towards commercial launch of our CLIA liquid biopsy test and of our transplant rejection test, and intend to continue to launch new products in the future.
 We launched Panorama, our non-invasive prenatal test, or NIPT, in March 2013 and have since gone from being the fourth company to enter the NIPT market to being the market leader by volume in the United States. Panorama represented approximately 55% of our revenues, with approximately 429,600 Panorama tests accessioned, during the year ended December 31, 2018. Our revenues were $257.7 million in 2018, compared to $209.6 million in 2017, as revised under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (“ASC 606”), and $212.5 million in 2016, as revised. Our net losses decreased to $128.2 million in 2018 from $137.6 million in 2017, as revised, but increased from $100.3 million in 2016, as revised. 
 In prenatal testing, oncology and transplant rejection, the use of blood-based tests offers significant advantages over older methods, but the significant technological challenge is that such testing requires the measurement of very small amounts of relevant genetic material circulating – fetal DNA in prenatal testing, tumor DNA in oncology, and donor DNA in transplant rejection – within a much larger blood sample. Our approach combines proprietary molecular biology and computational techniques to measure genomic variations in tiny amounts of DNA, as small as a single cell. Our molecular biology techniques are based on measuring thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, simultaneously using massively multiplexed polymerase chain reaction, or mmPCR, to multiplex, or target, many thousands of regions of the genome simultaneously in a single test reaction. Our method avoids losing molecules, which can happen when samples are split into separate reaction tubes, so that all relevant variants can be detected. We believe our approach represents a fundamental advance in molecular biology. In prenatal testing, this approach is distinct from the approach employed with other commercially available NIPTs, which use first-generation “quantitative”, or counting, methods to compare the relative number of sequence reads from a chromosome of interest to a reference chromosome. Based on extensive data published in the journals Obstetrics & Gynecology, American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Prenatal Diagnosis, and others, we believe Panorama is the most accurate NIPT commercially available in the United States. In oncology, our assay has demonstrated the ability to detect circulating tumor DNA, or ctDNA, with a high degree of sensitivity and

specificity. In transplant rejection, our test performance in both clinical and analytical validation achieved higher sensitivity and higher area under the curve, or AUC, than both the current standard of care and the current commercially available test. The current standard of care in transplant rejection monitoring is estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR, which is a clinically accepted but inaccurate biomarker for active transplant rejection. 
 Our Solution 
 Genetic inheritance is conveyed through DNA, a naturally occurring information storage system. DNA stores information in a linear sequence of the chemical bases adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine, represented by the symbols A, C, G, and T. Billions of bases of A, C, G, and T link together inside living cells to form the genome, which can be read like a code or a molecular blueprint for life. While differences in the specific sequence and structure of this code drive biological diversity, certain variations can also cause disease. Examples of genetic diversity include CNVs and SNVs. A CNV is a genetic mutation in which relatively large regions of the genome have been deleted or duplicated, and an SNV is a mutation where a single base has changed. When single base changes are common in the population, that position on the chromosome, or loci, is called a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP.
 To make sense of this deep and rich set of biological data and deliver a test result, we have developed computationally intensive algorithms that combine the data generated by mmPCR with the ever-expanding set of publicly available data on genetic variations. Our technology is compatible with standard equipment used globally and a range of NGS platforms, and we have optimized our algorithms to enable laboratories around the world to run tests locally and access our algorithms in the cloud. 
 We believe that our mmPCR technology and proprietary algorithms, which have been proven in the context of NIPT, can be a powerful tool for oncology applications such as molecular treatment monitoring and molecular residual disease, which we refer to as MRD, assessment, and in applications to monitor for organ transplant rejection. 
 In particular, we believe that our ability to interrogate DNA at tens of thousands of loci in parallel in a single reaction, at the scale of a single molecule, is well suited to the analysis of cancer-associated genetic mutations in ctDNA, in which many loci must be interrogated simultaneously without splitting a sample, and in which it is important to achieve sensitivity to tiny amounts of tumor DNA as low as a single copy. We are initially focused on treatment monitoring and MRD assessment in solid tumors, where we have generated data in over a dozen different cancer types and have published data in lung, bladder, colorectal and breast cancer. Based on our internal estimates, we believe that the total addressable market in the United States for MRD and recurrence monitoring for solid tumor cancers is over $12 billion, and the market for molecular treatment monitoring in metastatic disease is an additional $2 billion.
 We have demonstrated our ability to detect both CNVs and SNVs from very low concentrations of ctDNA. Our technology was featured on the cover of the May 2017 issue of Nature, which highlighted our performance in detecting relapse early, and predicting patient response to adjuvant therapy, in patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer. In August 2017, we launched SignateraTM (RUO), our first offering for oncology, for research use only, and we are working on developing this technology as a CLIA test. Signatera is a personalized assay that tests for the presence of ctDNA in a patient’s blood, which is associated with micrometastatic disease that is often undetectable with standard imaging techniques. If left untreated, micrometastatic disease is likely to proliferate and cause relapse. Signatera is designed for optimal MRD analysis, targeting 16 clonal variants in each assay, and incorporating information obtained from analyzing mutations specific to an individual’s tumor sample. 
 In transplant rejection, we have demonstrated the ability of our technology to measure the fraction of cell-free DNA that is donor-derived, or dd-cfDNA, which is DNA that is shed from a transplanted organ into circulation. We are working to commercialize a CLIA test based on this technology, which has been validated for detection of active rejection in renal transplant recipients, with test performance independent of donor type, rejection type, and clinical presentation.
 Our technologies allow us to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio when detecting fragments of DNA at frequencies as low as a single copy, which allows us to deliver tests with differentiated specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, our current prenatal commercial tests assess the risk of a broad range of conditions, which we refer to as “clinical coverage,” 

 
  6

 
including common fetal aneuploidies, microdeletions, triploidy, and inherited genetic conditions that could be passed on from parent to child, from a single blood draw. We sell our tests directly and partner with other clinical laboratories to distribute our tests globally. Currently, all of our products other than our Constellation cloud software product and our Evercord newborn stem cell banking offering are laboratory developed tests, or LDTs. We perform commercial testing in our CLIA-certified laboratory. 
 An illustration of the resolution that can be achieved with our mmPCR capability is provided below. The figures display data from our approximately 20,000 primer mmPCR assay, where each primer targets one SNP. On the left, the assay is applied to a large genomic DNA sample from a child. On the right, the assay is applied to a single cell from the same child. Each dot represents data from a particular SNP location on a chromosome. The assay measures the amount of each of the two possible sequences of nucleotides, or alleles, at each SNP. The plots below show the relative proportion of the two alleles, plotted along the vertical axis, for each of the approximately 20,000 SNPs, arranged sequentially along the vertical axis. The two alleles are arbitrarily labeled A and B, and each dot is colored according to the allelic contribution of the mother—red (A) or blue (B). Those SNPs where both copies of DNA in the child contain only the A allele are red and are found at the very top of the plot, and those SNPs where both copies of DNA in the child contain only the B allele are blue and are found at the very bottom of the plot. The SNPs where the fetus contains at least one copy of the A allele and one copy of the B allele are found near the center of the plot. The four vertical bars separated by dotted lines display data from chromosomes 13, 18, 21 and X. For chromosomes 13, 18 and X, the middle band is centered on 0.5; which indicates that for those SNPs, the child has one copy of the A allele and one copy of a B allele (and therefore a relative proportion of 0.5), and, therefore, has the right number of chromosomes—two. In this sample, an additional chromosome is present at chromosome 21, which indicates the presence of trisomy 21. For chromosome 21, the bands centered at 0.33 and 0.66 signal the additional nucleotides contributed by the mother. The band centered at 0.33 represents SNPs where the child has two copies of the B allele and one copy of the A allele, and the band centered at 0.66 represents SNPs where the child has two copies of the A allele and one copy of the B allele. The assay clearly quantifies the difference between single molecules of a particular allele at each SNP. The images demonstrate our ability to derive actionable information from tiny quantities of DNA, as the data from a single cell in the image on the right is nearly as informative as the data from a large genomic sample in the image on the left.

Our proprietary innovations in both molecular biology and bioinformatics drive performance of our current tests and our development pipeline. Our mmPCR technology optimizes the behavior of primers in a reaction to generate a high-resolution measurement of thousands of DNA loci in patient samples. As a result, we can capture mutations from a single DNA fragment within a large background of extraneous DNA found in a patient's blood sample. We believe our molecular technology has the potential to enable a broad range of applications in prenatal diagnostics and cancer. For example, the ability to target primers in a specific area of chromosome 22 allows our prenatal microdeletions panel to assess the risk of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, which is caused by the deletion of a small piece of chromosome 22, with demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity than other commercially available tests. If identified during pregnancy, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome can be treated with early intervention at the time of birth to avoid seizures and reduce cognitive impairment.

      Our bioinformatics technology complements our molecular technology to deliver a risk assessment with high sensitivity and specificity. We use proprietary statistical techniques to combine the measurements of our molecular assays with our internal databases and the vast and growing sources of publicly available genomic information to build highly detailed models of the genome of interest. This process includes the use of a statistical technique known as maximum likelihood estimation, or MLE, which is widely used in other industries, such as in the conversion of a noisy transmitted analog communications signal to a digital format. However, it is computationally complex to leverage this technique to combine genomic information from the patient's sample and information from the databases of the broader scientific community. We have issued U.S. patents claiming methods to do so and pending applications in the United States and abroad. We also maintain trade secrets on our processes and practices. Our proprietary solution using MLE enables us to continuously improve the performance of our existing tests and efficiently develop new ones. As our patient volumes grow,

our internal database of samples with genetic mutations and corresponding clinical outcomes further enhances our ability to interpret the clinical significance of complex genetic mutations. As the genomic data from the scientific community, such as from the Cosmic Database and the Cancer Genome Atlas, becomes richer, we can seamlessly integrate new clinical knowledge into our bioinformatics algorithm, driving further improvement in our tests. 
 Panorama
 We launched our Panorama NIPT in 2013, our microdeletions panel for Panorama in 2014 and our twins, egg donor, and surrogate screening capabilities in 2017. Panorama demonstrates the capabilities of our technology by employing our fundamentally unique approach of simultaneously measuring thousands of SNPs in a single test reaction to identify genetic variations in fetal DNA with a high degree of specificity and sensitivity. 
 Panorama helps physicians assess the risk of fetal genetic abnormalities by non-invasively screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities, including Down syndrome, Edwards syndrome, Patau syndrome, Turner syndrome and triploidy, which often result in intellectual disability, severe organ abnormalities and miscarriage. Panorama can also identify fetal sex for single birth pregnancies as well as of each fetus in twin pregnancies. Panorama is also the only commercially available NIPT that can determine whether a set of twins is identical, or monozygotic, or fraternal, or dizygotic. Identifying a monozygotic twin pregnancy can prompt earlier, targeted ultrasound assessments for chorionicity and associated complications, while knowing that a twin pregnancy is dizygotic reduces concerns about certain complications, such as twin-twin transfusion syndrome. 
 Panorama is performed on a maternal blood sample and can be performed as early as nine weeks into a pregnancy, which is significantly earlier than traditional methods, such as serum protein measurement whereby doctors measure the presence and amount of certain hormones in the blood. Panorama starts with a simple blood draw from the mother, either in a doctor's office, in a laboratory or through a phlebotomist that may travel to the patient, and the sample is sent to our CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited laboratory in California. We extract DNA from each sample, amplify the specific SNPs that we are interested in measuring, and then sequence the DNA using NGS. Using our proprietary bioinformatics technology, we analyze the DNA sequences to assess the state of the fetal genome, focusing on the SNP data, while incorporating public information from the Human Genome Project. Our bioinformatics algorithm builds billions of detailed models of the potential genetic state of the sample to determine the most likely diagnosis. After Panorama generates its result, we provide the doctor or the laboratory with a simple report showing the risk that abnormalities are present in the fetus. In 2018, we averaged approximately 97% of Panorama results delivered within ten calendar days after we received the blood sample. 
 The analytic and clinical validity of our technology demonstrated in Panorama and our other products has been described in multiple peer-reviewed publications, including the journals Clinical Embryology, Translational Oncology, Human Reproduction, Molecular Human Reproduction, Fertility and Sterility, PLOS ONE, Genetics in Medicine, Prenatal Diagnosis, Fetal Diagnosis and Therapy, Obstetrics & Gynecology, Genome Medicine, and American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology. Based on data published in Prenatal Diagnosis, Fetal Diagnosis and Therapy and Obstetrics & Gynecology, Panorama demonstrated greater than 99% overall sensitivity for aneuploidies on chromosomes 13, 18 and 21 and triploidy and specificity of greater than 99.9% (less than 0.1% false positive rate) for each disorder, which we believe makes it overall the most accurate NIPT commercially available in the United States. A paper published in the August 2014 issue of Obstetrics & Gynecology reported that Panorama had a statistically significant lower false positive rate than other NIPT methods practiced by our U.S. competitors. Based on data published in Obstetrics & Gynecology, Prenatal Diagnosis, and American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, we have also demonstrated the ability to identify fetal sex more accurately than competing NIPTs. This is partially a result of Panorama's unique ability to detect a vanishing twin, which is a known driver of fetal sex errors with quantitative methods used by our competitors. The October 2014 issue of the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology noted that the ability of Panorama to identify additional fetal haplotypes is expected to result in fewer false positive calls and prevent incorrect fetal sex calls. A study reporting on the use of Panorama in over 30,000 women, published in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, supported the use of NIPT as a first-line screening test for aneuploidy.

 We believe Panorama's specificity and sensitivity can give patients and their physicians a greater degree of comfort in choosing to forego unnecessary invasive procedures, limiting the resulting risk of spontaneous miscarriage associated with invasive procedures and lowering the total cost to the healthcare system of these procedures.
 Panorama screens for common genetic conditions that affect both high-risk pregnancies, where maternal age is over 35 and which we estimate represent approximately 20% of the over 6 million pregnancies in the United States, or over 1.2 million pregnancies, and average-risk pregnancies, which we estimate represent approximately 4.9 million pregnancies in the United States. By recognizing early on the importance of NIPT to average-risk pregnancies and maintaining a focus on this market, we are strategically positioned to capitalize on what we believe will be increased penetration and reimbursement of NIPT in all risk categories. NIPT has not historically been well reimbursed for the average-risk population; however, commercial payers representing close to half of all commercial covered lives in the United States now have a positive coverage determination for NIPT for average-risk pregnancies, and we believe that this momentum will continue consistent with the growing consensus among physicians, professional societies, and third-party payers that NIPT is an appropriate screening tool for all pregnant women. ACMG is the most recent professional society that has advocated for broader adoption of NIPT, including recommending informing pregnant women that NIPT is the most sensitive screening option for Patau, Edwards and Down syndromes, as well as of the availability of the expanded use of NIPT to screen for clinically relevant CNVs in the context of counseling that includes the risks/benefits and limitations of screening for CNVs. Furthermore, we believe that data from our DNAFirst study, showing that NIPT can be effectively and appropriately offered as a primary screen for all pregnant women regardless of risk due to maternal age or other factors, can help to drive further progress in average-risk NIPT reimbursement. These results were published in January 2017 in Genetics in Medicine. As part of this trial, we ran the Panorama test on over 2,600 pregnant women through Women and Infants Hospital in Rhode Island. DNAFirst was the first study demonstrating routine clinical use of cfDNA-based prenatal screening for common aneuploidies in a general U.S. population, offered through primary obstetric care providers.
 Our Panorama microdeletions panel screens for five of the most common genetic diseases caused by microdeletions – 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge syndrome), 1p36 deletion, Angelman syndrome, Cri-du-chat syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome. Microdeletions are missing sub-chromosomal pieces of DNA, and can have serious health implications depending on the location of the deletion. Unlike Down syndrome, where the risk increases with maternal age, the risk of these five microdeletions is independent of maternal age. Based on data published in Prenatal Diagnosis and American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, the combined prevalence of these targeted microdeletions is approximately one in 1,000 pregnancies, which collectively makes them more common than Down syndrome for women younger than approximately 28 years of age. Diseases caused by microdeletions are often not detected via common screening techniques such as ultrasound or hormone-based screening, yet the presence of a microdeletion can critically impact postnatal treatment. For example, when learning prior to birth that a newborn has 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, doctors will know to monitor the infant and administer calcium if needed to avoid seizures and permanent cognitive impairment, and will know to avoid administering routine vaccinations due to the immunodeficiency frequently associated with this condition.

Panorama has demonstrated best-in-class performance in screening for microdeletions. Panorama achieved sensitivity of 90% for deletions of approximately 2.9Mb for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, based on a validation study that contained 10 positives. It has also been validated to perform at low fetal fractions, which refers to the percentage of fetal DNA in a maternal plasma sample. Based on data published in the February 2018 issue of Clinical Genetics, Panorama demonstrated a PPV of 44.2% and false positive rate of 0.07% for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Furthermore, we have completed enrollment in our 20,000-patient SNP-based Microdeletions and Aneuploidy RegisTry (SMART) observational study to evaluate the performance of SNP-based NIPT for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome by tracking birth outcomes in the general population among women who present clinically and elect Panorama microdeletion and aneuploidy screening as part of their routine care. We expect to review perinatal medical records and collect postnatal DNA in order to perform genetic diagnostic testing for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Results from the follow-up specimens will be compared to those obtained by the Panorama screening test to determine test performance, particularly PPV.
 The graph below summarizes the incidence of genetic diseases for which prenatal screening is relatively common, as well as the incidence of genetic diseases caused by microdeletions that are screened by the Panorama microdeletions

panel. Incidence rates are higher than that of many commonly tested disorders, such as Cystic Fibrosis and Spinal Muscular Atrophy. We estimate that triploidy and the aneuploidy and microdeletion conditions that we screen for combined are more than three times as prevalent in the general population as the three most common autosomal aneuploidies, trisomies 13 (Patau syndrome), 18 (Edwards syndrome), and 21 (Down syndrome), alone.

 The graph below demonstrates how the relative incidence of Down syndrome and genetic diseases caused by the microdeletions screened for by the Panorama microdeletions panel varies with maternal age.

     Because the microdeletions that we screen for are more common at birth than fetal aneuploidies for children born to younger women, and based on the performance of Panorama on microdeletions, we believe our microdeletions testing capability is a significant driver of Panorama adoption in all risk categories, including those who are traditionally considered average-risk. We intend to continue to work closely with physicians, medical societies, payers, patient advocacy groups such as the International 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome Foundation, Inc., and our laboratory partners to demonstrate that Panorama's sensitivity and specificity across a range of chromosomal abnormalities and superior false positive rates, coupled with disease coverage for conditions for which prevalence does not vary with maternal age, represent a compelling case for a continued shift towards broad adoption in the average-risk population. 
 Furthermore, we believe that we are well-positioned for what we anticipate will be stable reimbursement for NIPT for microdeletions over the long term. A CPT code for use in billing and reimbursement for microdeletions testing went into effect in January 2017, and CMS provided a pricing benchmark for aneuploidy and microdeletions testing. See “—Reimbursement.” Since there are some Medicaid programs that haven't yet priced aneuploidy testing, we expect the pricing of aneuploidy testing set by CMS will further increase the number of Medicaid programs that price the test and may result in Medicaid plans pricing microdeletions testing at a faster pace. In addition, although most commercial insurances have already priced aneuploidy testing, the price established by CMS for microdeletions testing can serve as a relevant benchmark for pricing discussions with commercial insurance plans to begin reimbursement for microdeletions testing. Our microdeletions reimbursement has been, and we expect that it will, at least in the near term, remain low under the CPT code, either due to reduced reimbursement or third-party payers declining to reimburse under the code; however, we believe that growing recognition from professional societies, combined with the performance of our microdeletions

test and the additional validation data from our SMART study that we expect to report on the sensitivity and specificity of our tests, will drive broader reimbursement in the future. 
 Panorama is also validated to screen twin pregnancies, as well as egg donor and surrogate pregnancies. Our unique SNP technology makes Panorama the only commercially available NIPT that can distinguish between each twin’s DNA, and therefore can determine zygosity, or whether the twins are identical or fraternal, and the fetal sex of each twin. Determining zygosity early in a pregnancy can help guide the management of a pregnancy, as certain monozygotic, or identical twin, pregnancies are at higher risk for various complications such as twin-twin transfusion syndrome, where there is an unequal sharing of blood, and therefore unequal growth, between the twins. Panorama screens twin pregnancies for Down, Edwards and Patau syndromes and, for identical twins, Turner syndrome and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. In validation studies, Panorama identified identical twins with >99% sensitivity and specificity and achieved a combined sensitivity of >99% and specificity of >99% for Down, Edwards and Patau syndromes in twin pregnancies.
 Since launching Panorama, we have implemented various updates to both the molecular and computational portions of Panorama, continuing to improve performance and efficiency, and reduce the cost of running the test, for example by incorporating screening for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome in our base Panorama panel. Previous updates have significantly reduced Panorama’s no-call rate, improved sensitivity at lower fetal fractions, and simplified sample collection for clinics, and we’ve improved our microdeletions testing protocol to increase PPVs and reduce false positive rates. In validation studies, Panorama has demonstrated greater than 99% sensitivity and specificity for Down syndrome, and a combined sensitivity and specificity of greater than 99% across Down, Edwards, Patau and Turner syndromes. Furthermore, Panorama continues to maintain the highest commercially available sensitivity (90%) for deletions of approximately 2.9Mb for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, based on a validation study that contained 10 positives.
 Panorama's commercial performance has been consistent with our initial validation data. Data published in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology on 28,739 commercial cases of Panorama that were screened for Down, Edwards, Patau and Turner syndromes demonstrated an overall PPV of 83% for all indications combined. We believe Panorama's performance in commercial practice represents a significant improvement over first-generation NIPTs that rely on quantitative methods. Because Panorama does not require a reference chromosome, it is uniquely able to detect triploidy as well as full molar pregnancies. Panorama’s ability to differentiate between maternal and fetal DNA also allows Panorama to identify the presence of a vanishing twin, as well as maternal abnormalities, which have been shown in multiple studies to lead to false positives when using quantitative methods, particularly in the sex chromosomes where maternal abnormalities are common.
 Panorama has demonstrated substantial commercial success to date. We believe our test performance has allowed us to command a price premium compared to low-cost NIPTs while continuing to maintain growth in volume and revenue from Panorama.
 Horizon
 We launched our Horizon carrier screening test in 2012. Horizon helps couples determine if they are carriers of genetic mutations that cause specific diseases. Depending on the specific disease, if one or both parents are carriers for a specific disease, it could result in a child affected with the disease. Many people do not know they are a carrier for an inherited genetic disease until they have an affected child. These diseases are rare and usually there is no family history, although certain disorders are more common in certain ethnic groups. However, ethnicity may no longer be a reliable predictor of carrier status, as patients are increasingly of mixed or uncertain ethnicities. Accordingly, the industry’s approach to carrier screening has evolved over time, from ethnic-based screening targeting specific ethnicities with a higher incidence of screened conditions, to pan-ethnic screening for certain recommended conditions available to all patients, and most recently to expanded screening for many conditions simultaneously. In early 2017, ACOG expanded its guidelines on carrier screening, recommending universal screening for Spinal Muscular Atrophy in addition to Cystic Fibrosis, as many genetic conditions are not limited to any specific ethnic group, and providing guidance on expanded carrier screening. 

 
  12

 

 Horizon was created based on recommended screening guidelines from ACOG, ACMG, and the Victor Center for the Prevention of Jewish Genetic Diseases. Horizon screens for up to 274 inherited diseases, including Cystic Fibrosis, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, or DMD, Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Fragile X Syndrome and other conditions. Most conditions on the Horizon panel are autosomal recessive disorders, which means that both parents must be carriers for their children to be at risk. Some conditions are X-linked disorders, which are inherited from a mother who is a carrier and primarily affect male children. If both partners are carriers for the same recessive genetic disease, the couple has a 25% chance of having an affected child in each pregnancy. If a woman is a carrier of an X-linked disease, she has up to a 50% chance of having an affected child in each pregnancy. DMD, an X-linked condition, affects approximately 1/3500 male births, an incidence similar to Cystic Fibrosis and to Fragile X Syndrome in males. DMD is the most common muscular dystrophy in children and affects families of all ethnicities. Approximately 2/3 of clinically diagnosed cases of DMD are attributable to a carrier mother, who is likely unaware that she is a carrier. In addition to providing information about reproductive risks, carrier screening can identify women who are, themselves, at risk of health effects caused by defects in the DMD gene.
 The blood or saliva sample required for Horizon can be obtained simultaneously with the blood sample required for Panorama, which makes it easier for us to offer, and for patients to take, both tests. Horizon employs various methodologies, including next generation sequencing and copy number analysis, often in combination in order to increase test sensitivity, to analyze the DNA from the individual’s blood or saliva sample to determine if the individual is a carrier for the genetic diseases being screened. Horizon test results are generally returned to the ordering physician in ten to 15 business days from the day we receive the sample, depending on the number of conditions the patient has requested to be screened.
 Vistara
 We launched Vistara, an NIPT that screens for single-gene disorders across 30 genes, in 2017. Vistara is a complement to Panorama, and screens for severe skeletal, cardiac and neurological conditions which are often associated with cognitive disabilities or require surgical intervention. The conditions screened by Vistara have a combined incidence of approximately 1 in 600, which is higher than that of Down syndrome as well as Cystic Fibrosis, and are associated with advanced paternal age. Other NIPTs do not screen for these conditions, and prenatal ultrasounds may either fail to detect these disorders or the disorders may not present until much later in the pregnancy, after birth or even into childhood. Furthermore, family history is not a good indicator of risk for these conditions, which are commonly caused by de novo, or new and not inherited, mutations. Screening for these conditions early in the pregnancy can facilitate early diagnosis, enable patients to be referred to MFMs and other specialists for targeted evaluations, guide labor and delivery management, and allow families to mobilize resources, ask questions and anticipate future needs. We have received a CE Mark for Vistara from the European Commission.
 In validation studies, Vistara demonstrated a combined analytical sensitivity and analytical specificity of greater than 99%.
 Other reproductive health products
 Our preimplantation genetic test for aneuploidy, or PGT-A, which we market under the Spectrum brand, are for couples undergoing IVF. Spectrum can improve the chance of a successful pregnancy while reducing the chance of miscarriage or of having a child with a chromosome condition, by helping to identify the healthiest embryos during an IVF cycle. Spectrum evaluates the number of chromosomes in embryos to detect extra or missing pieces of chromosomes prior to transfer of embryos created through IVF procedures, which have a high rate of non-viable chromosomal abnormalities, known as aneuploidy, and screens for inherited genetic disorders. This allows IVF physicians to select and transfer chromosomally normal embryos. Aneuploidy is common in human embryos—particularly as women age—and is the primary cause of failed IVF. PGT-A has been shown to improve IVF outcomes for all women, regardless of maternal age. In a study published in April 2018, a retrospective analysis of pregnancy outcomes demonstrated that use of Spectrum during IVF led to increased rates of implantation, including in older women, clinical pregnancy, and live births. The study findings also demonstrated that use of PGT-A can increase the use of single embryo transfer, which can reduce the risks of multiple pregnancies. Spectrum incorporates our proprietary technology to further screen for uniparental disomy, in

which two copies of a chromosome come from the same parent; confirm parentage; and determine the parental origin of the chromosomal abnormality. 
 Anora is our products of conception, or POC, test, which analyzes miscarriage tissue from women who have experienced one or more pregnancy losses to determine whether there was an underlying chromosomal reason for the loss. The Anora test is helpful to obstetricians, gynecologists and IVF physicians in supporting their patients’ reproductive goals. Anora can help couples understand the likelihood of another miscarriage, their future reproductive options, and whether there are any steps that may help them avoid a miscarriage in future pregnancies. 
 Our non-invasive prenatal paternity product allows a couple to safely establish paternity without waiting for the child to be born. Testing can be done as early as nine weeks in gestation using a blood draw from the pregnant mother and alleged father. Our internal data indicates that the accuracy of this test is greater than 99.99%. We have licensed this technology to a third party to perform the test in its clinical laboratory. 
 Constellation
 Our Constellation software forms the core of our cloud-based distribution model. Through this model, we have been able to expand access to our molecular and bioinformatics capabilities worldwide, enabling laboratories, under a license from us, to run the molecular workflows themselves and then access our computation-intensive bioinformatics algorithms through Constellation, which runs in the cloud, to analyze the results. As of March 1, 2019, 15 licensees are using our Constellation platform commercially, including 14 in NIPT and one in prenatal paternity testing. We have licensing contracts with various other laboratories in the United States and internationally to develop products in both NIPT and oncology. Our licensees are in various stages of development and implementation of an NIPT product. We leverage Constellation to enhance adoption of our tests among laboratory licensees globally, and to perform our internal commercial laboratory activities and research and development of our products.
 We have received CE Marks from the European Commission for our Constellation software and for the key reagents that our laboratory licensees need to run their portion of the Panorama test prior to accessing our algorithms through Constellation. These CE Marks enable us to offer Constellation in the European Union and other countries that accept a CE Mark. We are pursuing other regulatory approvals, as needed, to allow the international roll out of Constellation in regions that do not accept a CE Mark.
 We believe that our cloud-based distribution model provides us with a competitive advantage by allowing us to, among others, accelerate international adoption by leveraging our licensees’ existing capabilities, efficiently achieve scale, and reduce costs. 
 Evercord
 We launched Evercord, a private cord blood and tissue banking service, in 2017. This offering enables expecting parents to collect, store and potentially retrieve their newborn’s stem cells for therapeutic use in transplantation and regenerative medicine applications for the child or related family members. Cord blood, which is the blood contained in the placental blood vessels and umbilical cord, contains HPCs, which are the blood-forming stem cells that are routinely used to treat patients with cancers such as leukemia or lymphoma, and other disorders of the blood and immune systems. Other sources of HPCs include bone marrow and peripheral blood, which is blood circulating in the body. Scientific literature has shown that in successful transplants, cord blood HPCs may not require as exact a match as HPCs from bone marrow or the bloodstream do, and, as a result, there is a higher chance of finding a cord blood stem cell match for transplant. Cord tissue, which is the tissue surrounding the umbilical vein and blood vessels in the umbilical cord, contains mesenchymal stem cells, or MSCs. MSCs can inhibit inflammation following tissue damage, secrete growth factors that aid in tissue repair, and develop into many different cell types such as bone, cartilage, muscle and nerve cells. Although there are no proven medical treatments currently available using cord tissue or MSCs, MSCs have the potential to treat more conditions than HPCs alone, such as heart disease, Parkinson’s disease and lung cancer. Published data suggests that one in three people in the United States, or 128 million people, could potentially benefit from regenerative medicine applications of cord blood and tissue if they are proven effective. More than 300 clinical trials involving cord blood and 

 
  14

 
tissue stem cells are currently underway, including studies focused on regenerative medicine. More than 30,000 cord blood stem cell treatments have been conducted worldwide. Based on the advances in research focused on stem cells and regenerative medicine, it is anticipated that number may continue to grow. 
 We believe that our Evercord offering is a natural extension of our mission and our experience in genetic testing, and ties in well to our other offerings. Our Horizon carrier screening test includes 35 of the nearly 80 diseases for which cord blood stem cell treatment has been administered. This complementary product offering also allows us to optimize our sales and marketing strategy and engage with potential customers earlier than our competitors in this space, through our patient and provider interactions early in their pregnancies facilitated by our NIPT and carrier screening offerings. 
 Our Evercord service was created in partnership with Bloodworks Northwest, or Bloodworks, which operates a public cord blood bank at one of only seven FDA-licensed cord blood banking facilities. Bloodworks has 20 years of cord blood banking experience and has released over 1,000 cord blood units for transplants. Under our service agreement with Bloodworks, Bloodworks performs processing and infectious disease testing services on blood samples submitted by Evercord customers and cryo-preserves the cord blood and tissue samples at its Seattle, Washington-based storage facility. We are also in the process of building out our own storage facility in the Seattle area, and expect to begin storing samples cryo-preserved by Bloodworks in our facility in mid-2019. We believe that we are well positioned to leverage our established commercial capabilities for Evercord because we already engage with potential Evercord customers through our offering of Panorama and Horizon products. Also, we believe that our patient portal and healthcare provider digital services through Natera Connect help us to establish a relationship and level of familiarity and trust, which puts us at a competitive advantage over other cord blood banking providers.
 Signatera
 MRD assessment has become a standard of care in the management of patients with hematological malignancies, but until now it has not been possible in solid cancers due to technical limitations. Accurate MRD testing and molecular monitoring offers the potential for physicians to change or escalate treatment in patients who are MRD-positive, and to de-escalate or avoid unnecessary treatment in patients who are MRD-negative. It also holds potential as a surrogate endpoint in clinical trials.
 In 2017 we launched Signatera (RUO), our first oncology offering, for research use only to cancer researchers and biopharmaceutical companies. Signatera (RUO) is a personalized circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assay that analyzes blood for the presence of mutations specific to an individual’s tumor. Each patient receives a custom assay, designed and manufactured on an individual basis based on the mutational signature found in that patient’s tumor. Signatera (RUO) is designed to screen for an average of 16 tumor-derived targets with each assay, and is able to detect mutations at concentrations as low as 0.01% fraction of cfDNA. We believe this approach is optimal in the MRD setting, in which it is common for tumor DNA to be present only at low frequencies immediately after treatment. In comparison, static liquid biopsy panels screen for a generic set of mutations independent of an individual’s tumor, generally covering fewer than five mutations for each patient and resulting in sensitivity that may suffer at low frequencies. The static approach also becomes economically inefficient in a commercial setting when scaling up to build larger panels that cover more mutations. We believe that Signatera’s approach, however, would be cost-effective and a compelling tool for repeat testing over a period of time. Signatera is also optimized to achieve high specificity on a sample level by requiring detection of multiple mutations in order for a plasma sample to be considered ctDNA positive. We expect to commercialize this technology for clinical use as an LDT in our own CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited laboratory in 2019.
 Our technology was selected for use in Cancer Research UK/University College London’s Tracking Cancer Evolution through Therapy (TRACERx) clinical trial for the multi-year monitoring of patient-specific SNVs in plasma, to understand the evolution of cancer mutations over time, and to monitor patients for disease recurrence. Results from the first 100 early-stage lung cancer patients analyzed as part of the study were featured on the cover of the May 2017 issue of Nature and showed that an early prototype version of Signatera identified 43% more ctDNA-positive early-stage lung cancer cases than a generic lung cancer panel and demonstrated its potential to detect residual disease, measure treatment response, and identify recurrence up to 11 months earlier than the standard of care, with a sensitivity of 93% at time of relapse.

 We have also completed research collaborations with Aarhus University in Denmark in locally advanced muscle invasive bladder cancer and in colorectal cancer. In both the bladder study and the colon study, blood was drawn prospectively at regular intervals over more than two years from initial diagnosis. The studies demonstrated the ability of our Signatera (RUO) test to stratify patients by whether they are MRD positive or negative based on post-treatment presence or absence of ctDNA in the blood. Signatera (RUO) detected molecular relapse an average of four months prior to clinical relapse in bladder cancer, and an average of over seven months in colorectal cancer. In addition to the data in MRD and recurrence monitoring, our Signatera technology showed promise in treatment response monitoring. In addition, in the bladder study, ctDNA analysis using Signatera (RUO) at the time of diagnosis predicted treatment outcome more accurately than all other variables traditionally used for clinical staging. 
 We have also completed two studies in breast cancer. In our study with Cancer Research UK-funded researchers at Imperial College London and the University of Leicester, U.K., which included patients with all three of the key breast cancer subtypes (ER+, HER2+, and Triple Negative), blood was prospectively collected every six months from patients who were relapse-free for at least three years after the completion of adjuvant treatment. Signatera (RUO) detected molecular residual disease with a lead time of up to two years prior to clinical or radiological detection, and overall detected clinical relapse with a sensitivity of 89% at time of relapse. Our second study in breast cancer, the Investigation of Serial Studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response with Imaging and Molecular Analysis 2 (I-SPY 2) trial with the University of California, San Francisco and QuantumLeap Healthcare Collaborative, launched in 2010, was a multi-center study evaluating the safety and efficacy of investigational therapies combined with early treatment in women with newly diagnosed, locally advanced breast cancer. As part of this trial, we analyzed blood samples at various points throughout patient treatment to evaluate the effectiveness of Signatera in monitoring disease burden, treatment response, and residual disease, as compared to traditional imaging methods. The results of this trial demonstrated that the change of measurable ctDNA from positive to negative during neoadjuvant treatment predicted therapeutic response, while failure to clear ctDNA after neoadjuvant treatment correlated with poor clinical outcomes. ctDNA levels were also associated with disease burden as determined by imaging.
 We are currently participating in research collaborations with various cancer centers and pharmaceutical companies in multiple cancer types, such as with Institut Jules Bordet, a multidisciplinary cancer reference center in Belgium, using our Signatera (RUO) assay to evaluate molecular response and minimal residual disease in women with early stage breast cancer, and Fox Chase Cancer Center, a leading cancer center in the United States, to assess our Signatera (RUO) assay for recurrence monitoring in kidney cancer.
 Transplant Rejection
 We are working to commercialize our technology for application in organ transplant rejection, and are initially focused on kidney transplants. The current tools for diagnosing organ transplant rejection are either invasive (biopsies) or inaccurate (serum creatinine), resulting in an unmet need for better diagnostic tools to monitor for allograft rejection and improve patient management and outcomes. Our assay is designed to detect active rejection in patients who have undergone kidney transplantation by measuring the fraction of dd-cfDNA in the recipient's blood, which can spike relative to background cfDNA when the transplanted organ is injured due to immune rejection. Our goal is to help physicians detect rejection events earlier, avoid unnecessary biopsies, and safely optimize immunosuppression levels, potentially lowering the overall costs associated with transplant care and improving graft survival. Based on our internal estimates, we believe the total addressable market in the United States for tests such as ours that predict kidney transplant rejection is over $2 billion.
 In June 2018, we announced study results in collaboration with the University of California, San Francisco, a recognized leader in transplantation care, demonstrating strong performance of our mmPCR technology for detecting active rejection in patients with kidney transplants. In the blinded, retrospective study, we leveraged our validated SNP technology to measure dd-cfDNA levels in plasma samples from kidney transplant patients, including patients experiencing active rejection. Our assay demonstrated 89% sensitivity in detecting active rejection, with specificity of 73%, based on a cutoff of 1% dd-cfDNA. The assay performed particularly well in detecting T-cell mediated rejection (TCMR) and subclinical rejection, both of which we believe are areas of unmet need.

 
  16

 

 In an analytical validation study published in the February 2019 issue of Transplantation, our assay demonstrated superior precision, up to 5 times better than the competing dd-cfDNA assay. Precision is a measure of the test’s ability to give the same result when a single sample is tested repeatedly. This study also included donor-recipient pairs that were related, such as parents or siblings, as well as non-related. This is significant because an estimated 52% of live kidney donations are from a biological relative of the patient, but it is technically challenging to differentiate between DNA patterns of close relatives. We were able to achieve a high degree of accuracy in these challenging cases by leveraging our experience with SNP-based methods in the prenatal setting.
 Direct Sales Force and Global Distribution Network 
 Through our direct sales efforts and worldwide network of over 100 laboratory and distribution partners, we have established a broad distribution channel. Our own direct sales force and managed care teams, which include approximately 150 genetics-focused sales representatives, anchor our commercial engagement with physicians, laboratory partners, and payers, and sell directly to MFMs, OB/GYNs, physicians or physician practices, IVF centers, or integrated health systems. In the NIPT market, Panorama is typically ordered for a patient by an MFM or OB/GYN. There are over 37,000 OB/GYNs in the United States and most of them practice generalist medicine for women's health. They typically only assist women with average risk pregnancies and will refer women with high risk pregnancies to one of the more than 2,000 MFMs in the United States. We believe that Panorama will continue to be adopted by physicians for broader use in average risk pregnancies, and therefore anticipate that we will continue to see an increasing proportion of Panorama orders in the future from OB/GYNs.
 Where our sales force can access physician offices directly, as in the U.S. market, we are able to maximize cross-selling opportunities by offering the full portfolio of our products. For example, we are promoting the use of Panorama NIPT, our Panorama microdeletions panel, and Horizon together for pregnant women who have not had a CS test at the time they are ready to have an NIPT performed. These tests can all be run using one blood draw from the mother and can be ordered on one requisition form and with one shipment of the patient’s samples by the physician. Also, because of the importance and demand for screening for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, we have included that feature as part of our basic Panorama panel, unless the patient or physician ordering the test opts out of the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome screen. In the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 68% of customers who ordered the basic Panorama panel directly from us also ordered screening for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome or the full microdeletions panel, and approximately 33% of customers who ordered Panorama directly from us also ordered Horizon carrier screening.
 In our Evercord business, in addition to promoting to physician practices directly through our sales force, we have a unique opportunity to engage with potential Evercord customers early in their pregnancies as we build a relationship with them through our prenatal tests. We are able to leverage this early engagement to sell newborn stem cell banking directly to our existing patients. Other cord blood service providers typically market to potential customers much later in pregnancy.

We plan to market our Signatera CLIA test to oncologists through our direct sales force. We have entered into an agreement with a transplant diagnostics company to co-market our kidney transplant rejection test in the United States in conjunction with our direct sales force.
 We generate a higher gross margin when we sell testing services directly, compared to when our products are distributed by laboratory partners to be performed at our CLIA-certified laboratory. The percentage of our revenues generated through the higher margin U.S. direct sales force channel was approximately 83% in 2018, down from approximately 84% in 2017 and up from approximately 78% in 2016. In January 2017, we terminated our licensing and distribution agreement with Bio-Reference Laboratories, Inc., or Bio-Reference, a laboratory distribution partner that accounted for approximately 7% of our revenues in 2016, and began directly servicing the accounts that were previously ordering through Bio-Reference.
 In addition to our sales force, we market to physicians through clinical journals, educational webinars, conferences, tradeshows and e-mail marketing campaigns. While we do not sell directly to patients other than for our Evercord offering, we do engage in brand awareness campaigns directed at patients to highlight our products. Our 

 
  17

 
marketing and medical science liaison teams work extensively with key opinion leaders in the prenatal genetic testing field. We also dedicate resources to assist our laboratory partner network in marketing Panorama and our other products by conducting joint events, joint advertising and developing joint tools with our partner network. 
 We generate the highest gross margins on royalty revenue collected from laboratories that run tests in their own facilities and have the sequencing data analyzed by our Constellation software under our cloud-based distribution model. As of March 1, 2019, 15 signed licensees are commercializing products using our Constellation platform. We have licensing contracts with other laboratory licensees, both in the United States and internationally, to develop their own NIPT LDTs and access our algorithm through our Constellation platform. 

Our partners' capabilities augment our direct sales capabilities, and where we have identified laboratory or distribution partners who share our focus on premium quality and service, we also contract with them to distribute our tests. In NIPT, we have partnered with leading academic and commercial laboratories and hospital systems in the United States to capitalize on their relationships with MFMs and OB/GYNs, large distribution capabilities, and commercial infrastructure. These distribution partners also frequently have in-network contracts with key third party payers. As of December 31, 2018, we had in-network contracts with insurance providers that accounted for over 209 million, out of a total of approximately 294 million, covered lives in the United States. We continue our efforts to increase the number of our in-network contracts with payers. Our target market for NIPT is a much smaller subset of these covered lives, because it excludes men, children and post-menopausal women who would not be users of the majority of our products. Outside of the United States, where our products are sold in over 80 countries, we currently sell predominantly through partner laboratories. 
 Enhanced User Experience 
 Natera Digital Services
 We have created an integrated platform encompassing various digital services designed to enhance the patient and provider experience. 
 Our patient portal is a one-stop resource for patients to access information and services throughout their experience with our products, from pre-test to post-test. After logging on to the patient portal, patients are able to easily access information about our tests and services, order tests, track their status and access results, and pay their bill. We have recently implemented a price transparency tool whereby patients can receive an estimate of their test cost and out of pocket responsibility, and have initially launched on a pilot basis a pre-test cost estimator whereby patients can receive a personalized cost estimate prior to a blood draw. We believe that these cost estimation features provide peace of mind to patients and providers and helps to mitigate cost concerns as a barrier to NIPT adoption.
 Natera Connect is our physician portal, which enables physicians to easily complete various tasks online including ordering tests, tracking the status of a patient's test, reviewing patient results online, sharing results with patients, connecting with genetic counselors, ordering supplies and educational materials, and offering live chat support. We also provide a service to integrate with our customers' Electronic Medical Records, or EMR, systems to provide physicians a seamless experience of ordering tests and reviewing patient test results directly through their EMR systems.
 Access to Genetic Counselors 
 After receiving a report with results from any of our products, doctors have access by phone to our team of genetic counselors should they have any questions or require any guidance in interpreting the results. Patients themselves may contact our genetic counselors for information by phone either before or after taking one of our tests, with direct access provided to all patients who are tested with Spectrum or Anora and patients who have a high-risk result for a genetic disease based on Horizon screening or for a microdeletion syndrome based on Panorama screening. 

 
  18

 

 Phlebotomy Services
 We have a network of over 2,000 phlebotomy centers in the United States. We also offer mobile phlebotomy services whereby a patient can request and schedule a phlebotomist visit at the patient’s home or office. Other Future Applications of our Technology
 We intend to refine and expand our offering in prenatal diagnostics by leveraging our core technology and the data we gather as our sample volumes grow. For example, the microdeletion samples that we gather through Panorama NIPT or through Anora POC testing help us to refine the algorithms that detect these anomalies, determine the exact genetic regions where these anomalies are sought, and increase the accuracy with which they are reported. We have substantial intellectual property covering the analysis of single cells, an approach we use to analyze embryos with our Spectrum products to improve the success of IVF. We believe that our technology may allow us to capitalize on future advances in isolating fetal cells from a mother's blood, which could allow us to measure more of the fetal genome non-invasively and with even higher accuracy, and potentially enable us to replace invasive confirmatory procedures, such as amniocentesis, over time. Importantly, we believe that we have a distinct advantage in our opportunity in single-cell isolation because our technology can not only analyze very small samples, but can also confirm that the cells are fetal as opposed to maternal.
 We believe that, in the future, our informatics technology may have the ability to generate a nearly full genome of an individual, roughly nine weeks after the individual is conceived. Publications in Genome Medicine, Science and PLoS Genetics highlight the ability of our informatics technology to determine which chromosome segments from the parent contributed to the DNA of the fetus and hence to substantially reconstruct the genome of the fetus using only a tiny amount of fetal DNA. This enhanced view of the full genome early in life, combined with knowledge of the parent DNA, has the potential to substantially impact the management of many aspects of an individual's health, from birth through adulthood. Future applications of such an offering may include prediction of disease susceptibilities and appropriate interventions, selection of drugs and drug dosages, nutrition guidance and many other emerging applications. 
 We believe that our ability to design custom panels and targeted assays can be utilized in various research applications such as variant discovery and mechanism of action studies, among others, and clinical applications in diagnostics and therapeutics. Some areas that we believe other researchers and laboratories may be interested in applying this technology are: forensic identity analysis in mixtures for law enforcement, agricultural sample screening for patented lines, prenatal relationship testing for veterinary breeding and cell line purity testing for cell repositories. We are also investigating the potential application of our technology to other specimen types beyond blood, such as urine or sputum, which may have applications in the oncology diagnostics field.
 Key Relationships 
 Illumina
 We are party to a supply agreement with Illumina, Inc., or Illumina, for the supply of Illumina genetic sequencing instruments and reagents for NIPT, oncology and transplant diagnostic testing. For oncology, we also received rights to develop and sell in vitro diagnostic kits and services worldwide, in exchange for which we agreed to make certain milestone and royalty payments to Illumina. During the term of the supply agreement, which expires in June 2026, Illumina has agreed to supply us with sequencers, reagents and other consumables for use with the Illumina sequencers, and we must provide a forecast, on a monthly basis, detailing our needs for certain of the Illumina products. The first four calendar months of each forecast are binding and the fourth month can vary by only up to 25% more or less than what was forecasted for that month in the prior month's forecast. In addition, during each calendar quarter, we must spend a minimum amount on reagents under this agreement. We and Illumina have agreed on prices for the sequencers and reagents, for which we are entitled to certain discounts based on total spend and other factors. Illumina has the right to adjust these prices under certain conditions. In addition, we must pay a fee to Illumina for each clinical NIPT test that we perform using Illumina reagents. Illumina is currently the sole supplier of our sequencers and related reagents for Panorama, along with certain hardware and software; we are not bound to use exclusively Illumina's sequencing instruments and reagents for conducting 

 
  19

 
our sequencing, but if we use other sequencing instruments and reagents for NIPT clinical use, we may no longer be entitled to discounts from Illumina. 
 Illumina may terminate the agreement upon the following circumstances: if we materially breach the agreement and fail to cure such breach within 30 days after receiving written notice of such breach, and only after complying with additional notice provisions; if we become the subject of certain bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or in connection with certain changes of control of Natera. Illumina also has the right to terminate: (a) certain rights under the agreement upon two years’ prior notice, but no earlier than June 8, 2021; and (b) our rights with respect to IVDs if we have not obtained a premarket approval for at least one IVD from the United States Food and Drug Administration by June 8, 2021, unless we are diligently pursuing approval of an active PMA application at such time. We may terminate the agreement: if Illumina materially breaches the agreement and fails to cure such breach within 30 days after receiving written notice of such breach, and only after complying with additional notice provisions; if Illumina becomes the subject of certain bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings; in connection with certain supply failures by Illumina or for convenience with four months written notice. The agreement also contains use limitations, representations and warranties, indemnification, limitations of liability and other provisions. 
 Qiagen
 We are party to a license, distribution and development agreement with QIAGEN LLC (the “Agreement”) for the development and distribution of NGS-based genetic tests on our proprietary technology for use on QIAGEN's proprietary GeneReader® NGS sequencing platform in certain countries globally. Under the Agreement, which has a ten (10) year term, we will receive an upfront license fee and prepaid royalties totaling $40 million. QIAGEN will owe us tiered royalties on a percentage basis based on net sales of its sequencers and reagent kits that are distributed by QIAGEN, as enabled by our technology. The tiers increase after the first and second years after commercial launch of such products. These royalties will initially be credited against the prepaid royalties and then paid quarterly to us once the prepaid royalties have been fully credited. QIAGEN has also committed to a minimum net sales requirement. We are also entitled to milestone payments from QIAGEN totaling $10 million upon the achievement of certain volume, regulatory, and commercial milestones.  
     For a certain period, QIAGEN is restricted from developing assays in prenatal screening competitive to the ones being developed based on our technology under this Agreement, and we are restricted from developing and selling certain in vitro diagnostic kits in prenatal screening independent of QIAGEN, unless such kits have been approved by regulatory authorities separately from a sequencing platform. These restrictions could be removed if QIAGEN fails to satisfy certain requirements related to the development and performance of its sequencing platform and to sales of the assays that are subject to the Agreement. In addition, if, in the future, QIAGEN satisfies certain requirements related to the development and performance of its sequencing platform for use with our prenatal screening assays, additional provisions related to an extended cooperation between both parties will apply.
     The Agreement contains representations, warranties, covenants, termination provisions, and indemnification provisions that are generally customary for a transaction of this type. 
 We must return up to $15 million of the prepaid royalties if the Agreement expires, or under termination of the Agreement in most circumstances, without such prepaid royalties having been earned. The remainder of the prepaid royalties, to the extent not yet earned, and the technology access fee, are subject to return to QIAGEN by us only in the event of certain terminations of the Agreement.
 Competition 
 The markets in which we operate are characterized by innovation and rapid change, and we primarily face competition from various companies that develop and commercialize molecular diagnostic tests in prenatal health, oncology, and organ transplant rejection. Our competitors in the NIPT space include Sequenom, Inc., or Sequenom, which was acquired by Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, or LabCorp; Illumina, through its subsidiary Verinata; Ariosa, Inc., a subsidiary of F. Hoffman La-Roche Ltd, or Roche; Myriad Genetics, Inc., which has acquired Counsyl, Inc.; 

 
  20

 
Quest Diagnostics Incorporated, or Quest; Premaitha Health PLC; BGI; Progenity, Inc., or Progenity; LifeCodexx AG; Bio-Reference, a business unit of OPKO Health, Inc. and which was previously a laboratory distribution partner of ours; and Multiplicom N.V., which was acquired by Agilent Technologies Inc. We also compete against companies providing carrier screening tests such as LabCorp; Myriad Genetics, Inc. through its acquisition of Counsyl, Inc.; Invitae Corp. through its acquisition of Good Start Genetics, Inc.; Progenity; Recombine Inc.; Quest; and GenPath Diagnostics, a business unit of Bio-Reference. Each of these companies offers comprehensive CS panels.
 In the field of cancer diagnostics, and liquid biopsy tests specifically, we expect to compete with various companies that offer or seek to offer competing solutions, such as Roche Molecular Systems Inc., a subsidiary of Roche, Guardant Health, Inc., Adaptive Biotechnologies, Personal Genome Diagnostics, Inc., Foundation Medicine, Inc., which is also a subsidiary of Roche, and Genomic Health Inc. 
 In organ transplant rejection, we anticipate that our primary competitor will be CareDx, Inc. 
 We expect additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter these markets, including through business combinations, and as new tests and technologies are introduced. These competitors could have greater technological, financial, reputational and market access resources than us. 
 We believe the principal competitive factors in our molecular diagnostic testing markets include the following:

· | test performance, as demonstrated in clinical and analytical studies and clinical trials as well as in commercial experience;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | for prenatal testing, comprehensiveness of coverage of diseases and ability to conveniently test for multiple conditions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | for cancer diagnostics, comprehensiveness of coverage of cancer types and indications;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | value of product offerings, including pricing and impact on other healthcare spending;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | scope and extent of reimbursement and payer coverage;
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts;
--+----------------------------------------------


· | breadth of distribution of products and partnership base;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | reputation among patients and providers for development and introduction of new, innovative products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | operational execution, including test turn-around time and test failures;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | key opinion leader support;
--+----------------------------


· | brand awareness; and
--+---------------------


· | ease of integration for laboratories, including for cloud-based distribution models.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Specific market share data regarding our products is not publicly available, and consumers may choose to use competing products for a variety of reasons, including lower cost. We believe, however, that we compete favorably in the prenatal testing market on the basis of several factors, particularly test performance, comprehensiveness of coverage of diseases, ability to conveniently test for multiple conditions, value of product offerings and effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts. In oncology, we believe that the sensitivity and specificity of our technology compare favorably to generic panel-based ctDNA assays due to our individualized approach. 

 
  21

 

 In cord blood and tissue banking, we compete with companies such as Cord Blood Registry; ViaCord, a division of PerkinElmer, Inc.; Cryo-Cell International, Inc.; LifeBankUSA; Americord Registry LLC; and StemCyte USA. We believe the principal competitive factors in this market include quality, measured by number and stature of accreditations; experience in transplants; stability and longevity; price, for example promotions, coupons and benefits such as referral programs; services offered, such as designated transplant programs and extra services such as access to genetic counselors; ease of customer experience, including process, communication, kit shipping and availability, and timely notifications. We believe that we compete favorably in this market based on all of these factors.
 Intellectual Property 
 Our success and ability to compete depend in part on securing and preserving enforceable patent, trade secret, trademark and other intellectual property rights; operating without having competitors infringe, misappropriate or otherwise circumvent these rights; operating without infringing the proprietary rights of others; and obtaining and maintaining licenses for technology development and/or product commercialization. As of December 31, 2018, we held 54 issued U.S. and foreign patents, which expire between November 2026 and December 2036, and over 100 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. Our patents and patent applications relate generally to molecular diagnostics, and more specifically to biochemical and analytical techniques for obtaining and analyzing genetic information to detect genetic abnormalities in relatively small complex samples, such as cell free fetal DNA or circulating tumor DNA. We intend to seek patent protection as we develop new technologies and products in this area.
 In the past, parties have filed, and in the future parties may file, claims asserting that our technologies or products infringe on their intellectual property. For example, we are currently involved in patent infringement litigation with Illumina and have in the past been involved in patent infringement litigation with Sequenom. We cannot predict whether other parties will assert such claims against us, or whether those claims will harm our business. The field of molecular diagnostics is complex and rapidly evolving, and we expect that we and others in our industry will continue to be subject to third-party infringement claims.
 Reimbursement 
 We receive reimbursement from commercial third-party payers and from government health benefits programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. We receive reimbursement for our Panorama, Horizon, Vistara, Anora and Spectrum tests, and are in the process of pursuing reimbursement for our Signatera CLIA test and transplant rejection test, both of which we are currently developing for commercialization. 
 Laboratory tests, as with most other healthcare services, are classified for reimbursement purposes under a coding system known as Current Procedure Terminology, or CPT, which we and our customers must use to bill and receive reimbursement for our diagnostic tests. These CPT codes are associated with the particular test that we have provided to the patient. Once the American Medical Association establishes a CPT code, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, establishes payment levels and coverage rules under Medicare while private payers establish rates and coverage rules independently. For most of the tests performed for Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries, laboratories are required to bill Medicare or Medicaid directly, and to accept Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement as payment in full. Prior to 2015, CMS had implemented a set of CPT codes without a fee schedule for most codes specific to NIPTs; however, a CPT code specific to NIPT for aneuploidies has been effective since January 2015, and a CPT code for microdeletions has been effective since January 2017. CMS has established a pricing benchmark of $802 for aneuploidy and microdeletions testing. In addition, a CPT code for expanded carrier screening tests went into effect in January of this year, for which CMS has established a pricing benchmark of approximately $2,450. 
 We currently submit for reimbursement using CPT codes based on the guidance of coding experts and outside legal counsel. There is a risk that these codes may be rejected or withdrawn or that payers will seek refunds of amounts that they claim were inappropriately billed to a specific CPT code. We do not currently have a specific CPT code assigned for all of our tests, and there is a risk that we may not be able to obtain specific codes for such tests, or if obtained, we may not be able to negotiate favorable rates for one or more of these codes. In particular, while we have obtained a CPT code for microdeletions and CMS has set a price for microdeletions testing, we expect that our microdeletions reimbursement 

 
  22

 
will decline, at least in the near term, because third-party payers are declining to reimburse under the new code or reimbursing at a much lower rate than we had previously received before the CPT code was established. The reimbursement rates for our broader Horizon screening panel may also decline as a result of the new CPT code becoming effective in 2019, as carrier screening tests that had previously been reimbursed on a per-condition basis may be reimbursed as a combined single panel instead of as multiple individual tests. 
 NIPT has received positive coverage determinations for high-risk pregnancies and are reimbursed by most private payers, including United Healthcare, AETNA, Anthem, Humana, CIGNA and others. Reimbursement policies for the use of NIPT for average-risk pregnancies have not been widely established, but recent publications have analyzed the use of NIPT in the average-risk population and certain medical societies have supported such use. In particular, ACMG has issued guidelines recommending that pregnant women be informed that NIPT is the most sensitive screening option for Patau, Edwards and Down syndromes, as well as of the availability of the expanded use of NIPT to screen for clinically relevant CNVs in the context of counseling that includes the risks/benefits and limitations of screening for CNVs. ISPD has issued guidelines that are supportive of NIPT in average-risk pregnancies as well as high-risk pregnancies. However, SMFM has issued a guideline stating that while all pregnant women should be informed of the option to receive NIPT, conventional screening methods, rather than NIPT, remain the most appropriate choice for first-line screening for average-risk pregnancies. ACOG has withdrawn its previous guideline, which was consistent with SMFM’s guideline, and it remains uncertain when ACOG will issue a new guideline as well as whether and to what extent such guideline may be supportive of NIPT in the average-risk setting. Private payers are moving towards reimbursing for average-risk NIPT. Fifty-nine commercial payers in the United States, representing close to half of all commercial covered lives in the United States, and several state Medicaid programs, have a positive coverage determination for NIPT for average-risk pregnancies.
 Based on Health Leaders publication data, as of December 31, 2018 we and our laboratory partners had in-network contracts with insurance providers that accounted for over 209 million covered lives, out of a total of approximately 294 million covered lives, in the United States. Our target market for NIPT is a much smaller subset of these covered lives, because it excludes men, children and post-menopausal women who would not be users of our products.
 Government Regulations 
 Our business is subject to and impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the United States (at both the federal and state levels) and internationally. These laws and regulations include regulations particular to our business and laws and regulations relating to conducting business generally (e.g., export controls laws, U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws of other jurisdictions). We also are subject to inspections and audits by governmental agencies. Set forth below are highlights of certain key regulatory schemes applicable to our business. Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 and State Regulation 
 As a clinical laboratory, we are required to hold certain federal and state licenses, certifications and permits to conduct our business. As to federal certifications, in 1988, Congress passed the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, establishing more rigorous quality standards for all laboratories that perform testing on human specimens for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease. CLIA requires such laboratories to be certified by the federal government and mandates compliance with various operational, personnel, facilities administration, quality and proficiency testing requirements intended to ensure the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results. CLIA certification is also a prerequisite to be eligible to bill state and federal healthcare programs, as well as many commercial third-party payers, for laboratory testing services.
 Our laboratory located in San Carlos, California is CLIA certified. Our laboratory must comply with all applicable CLIA requirements. If a clinical laboratory is found to be out of compliance with CLIA standards, CMS may impose sanctions, limit or revoke the laboratory’s CLIA certificate (and prohibit the owner, operator or laboratory director from owning, operating, or directing a laboratory for two years following license revocation), a directed plan of correction, on-site monitoring, civil monetary penalties, civil actions for injunctive relief, criminal penalties, or suspension or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

 
  23

 

 CLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations that are more stringent than those under federal law, and a number of states have implemented their own more stringent laboratory regulatory requirements. State laws may require that laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality control procedures or facility requirements, or prescribe record maintenance requirements. We are required to meet certain laboratory licensing requirements for those states in which we offer services or from which we accept specimens and that have adopted regulations beyond CLIA. For more information on state licensing requirements, see ‘‘—California Laboratory Licensing’’, ‘‘—New York Laboratory Licensing,’’ and ‘‘—Other State Laboratory Licensing Laws.’’
 Our laboratory has also been accredited by the College of American Pathologists, or CAP, which means that our laboratory has been certified as following CAP guidelines in operating the laboratory and in performing tests that ensure the quality of our results. 
 FDA 
 In the United States, medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations. The laws and regulations govern, among other things, medical device development, testing, labeling, storage, premarket clearance or approval, advertising and promotion and product sales and distribution. To be commercially distributed in the United States, medical devices must receive from the FDA prior to marketing, unless subject to an exemption, clearance of a premarket notification, or 510(k), premarket approval, or a PMA, or a de novo authorization.
 IVDs are a type of medical device that can be used in the diagnosis or detection of diseases, conditions or infections, including, without limitation, the presence of certain chemicals, genetic information or other biomarkers. Predictive, prognostic and screening tests, such as carrier screening tests, can also be IVDs. A subset of IVDs are known as analyte specific reagents, or ASRs. ASRs consist of single reagents, and are intended for use in a diagnostic application for the identification and quantification of an individual chemical substance in biological specimens. ASRs are medical devices, but most are exempt from the premarket review processes. As medical devices, ASRs have to comply with some quality system regulation, or QSR, provisions and other device requirements.
 The FDC Act classifies medical devices into one of three categories based on the risks associated with the device and the level of control necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are deemed to be low risk and are subject to the fewest regulatory controls. Many Class I devices are exempt from FDA premarket review requirements. Class II devices, including some software products to the extent that they qualify as a device, are deemed to be moderate risk, and generally require clearance through the premarket notification, or 510(k) clearance, process. Class III devices are generally the highest risk devices and are subject to the highest level of regulatory control to provide reasonable assurance of the device's safety and effectiveness. Class III devices typically require a PMA by the FDA before they are marketed. A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application and is sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. All clinical studies of investigational devices must be conducted in compliance with any applicable FDA and Institutional Review Board requirements. Devices that are exempt from FDA premarket review requirements must nonetheless comply with post-market general controls as described below, unless the FDA has chosen otherwise.
 510(k) clearance pathway. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating to the FDA's satisfaction that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k)-cleared device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for submission of PMA applications. The previously cleared device is known as a predicate. The FDA's 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to 12 months from submission, but it can take longer, particularly for a novel type of product. 
 PMA pathway. The PMA pathway requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA's satisfaction. The PMA pathway is costly, lengthy, and uncertain. A PMA application must provide extensive preclinical and clinical trial data as well as information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device 

 
  24

 
design, manufacturing, and labeling. As part of its PMA review process, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer's facilities for compliance with QSR requirements, which impose elaborate testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures. The PMA review process typically takes one to three years from submission but can take longer. 
 De novo pathway. If no predicate device can be identified, the product is automatically classified as Class III, requiring a PMA application. However, the FDA can reclassify, or use "de novo classification," for a device for which there was no predicate device if the device is low- or moderate-risk. If the device is deemed Class II, the FDA will identify "special controls" that the manufacturer must implement, which often include labeling and other restrictions. Subsequent applicants can rely upon the de novo product as a predicate for a 510(k) clearance, unless FDA exempts subsequent devices from the need for a 510(k). The de novo route is less burdensome than the PMA process, but FDA has issued a proposed regulation that, if adopted as written, would increase the regulatory burden in obtaining a de novo authorization. A device company can ask the FDA at the outset if the de novo route is available and submit the application as one requesting de novo classification. The de novo route has been used for many IVD products. The FDA has indicated to us that our software that enables our cloud-based distribution model may be appropriate for review under the de novo classification process. However, the FDA has not committed to this position and may take a different position in the future.
 Post-market general controls. After a device, including a device exempt from FDA premarket review, is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: the QSR, labeling regulations, registration and listing, the Medical Device Reporting regulation (which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur), and the Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation (which requires manufacturers to report recalls and field actions to the FDA if initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDC Act). 
 The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. If the FDA finds a violation, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from an untitled or public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; recall or seizure of products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products; withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMAs already granted; and criminal prosecution. For additional information, see "Risk Factors—Reimbursement and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business." 
 Research use only. Research use only, or RUO, products belong to a separate regulatory classification under a long-standing FDA regulation. RUO products are not regulated as medical devices and are therefore not subject to the regulatory requirements discussed above. The products must bear the statement: "For Research Use Only. Not for Use in Diagnostic Procedures." RUO products cannot make any claims related to safety, effectiveness or diagnostic utility, and they cannot be intended for human clinical diagnostic use. A product labeled RUO but intended to be used diagnostically may be viewed by the FDA as adulterated and misbranded under the FDC Act and is subject to FDA enforcement activities, including requiring the supplier to seek clearance, approval or authorization for the products. Our LDT uses instruments and reagents labeled as RUO. 
 Laboratory-developed tests. LDTs have generally been considered to be tests that are designed, developed, validated and used within a single laboratory. The FDA takes the position that it has the authority to regulate such tests as medical devices under the FDC Act. The FDA has historically exercised enforcement discretion and has not required clearance or approval of LDTs prior to marketing. 
 On October 3, 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents regarding oversight of LDTs. These draft guidance documents proposed more active review of LDTs. The draft guidances were the subject of considerable controversy, and in November 2016, the FDA announced that it would not be finalizing the 2014 draft guidance documents. On January 13, 2017, the FDA issued a discussion paper which laid out elements of a possible revised future LDT regulatory framework, but did not establish any regulatory requirements. 

 
  25

 

 The FDA’s efforts to regulate LDTs have prompted the drafting of legislation governing diagnostic products and services that sought to substantially revamp the regulation of both LDTs and IVDs. Congress may still act to provide further direction to the FDA on the regulation of LDTs and substantially modify the regulation of IVDs. 
 We believe that other than the RUO version of Signatera, all of the tests we currently offer, including Panorama, meet the definition of LDTs, as they have been designed, developed, and validated for use in a single CLIA-certified laboratory. If our tests are LDTs, they are currently not subject to FDA regulation as medical devices.
 California Laboratory Licensing 
 In addition to federal certification requirements for laboratories under CLIA, we are required under California law to maintain a California state license for our San Carlos clinical laboratory and comply with California state laboratory laws and regulations. Similar to the federal CLIA regulations, the California state laboratory laws and regulations establish standards for the operation of a clinical laboratory and performance of test services, including the education and experience requirements of a laboratory director and personnel (including requirements for documentation of competency); equipment validations; and quality management practices. All testing personnel must maintain a California state license or be supervised by licensed personnel.
 Clinical laboratories are subject to routine on-site inspections by the state. If a clinical laboratory is found to be out of compliance with California standards, the California Department of Public Health, or CAPH, may suspend, restrict or revoke the California state laboratory license to operate the clinical laboratory (and exclude persons or entities from owning, operating, or directing a laboratory for two years following license revocation), assess civil money penalties, and impose specific corrective action plans, among other sanctions. 
 New York Laboratory Licensing 
 Because we receive test specimens originating from New York State, our San Carlos clinical laboratory is required to obtain a New York state laboratory permit and comply with New York state laboratory laws and regulations. The New York state laboratory laws, regulations and rules are equal to or more stringent than the CLIA regulations and establish standards for the operation of a clinical laboratory and performance of test services, including education and experience requirements of a laboratory director and personnel; physical requirements of a laboratory facility; equipment validations; and quality management practices. The laboratory director must maintain a Certificate of Qualification issued by the New York State Department of Health, or DOH, in the permitted categories.
 Our clinical laboratory is subject to proficiency testing and on-site survey inspections conducted by the Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program, or CLEP, of the DOH. If a laboratory is found to be out of compliance with New York’s CLEP standards, the DOH, may suspend, limit, revoke or annul the New York laboratory permit, censure the holder of the license or assess civil money penalties. Statutory or regulatory noncompliance may result in a laboratory’s operator, owners and/or laboratory director being found guilty of a misdemeanor under New York law.
 Our clinical laboratory maintains a valid permit in the State of New York for the molecular genetic testing services furnished by our clinical laboratory.
 The DOH also must approve each LDT before the test is offered to patients located in New York. Our clinical laboratory has received approval from New York’s DOH to offer our basic Panorama test to women with high-risk pregnancies and a conditional approval to offer both our basic Panorama and Panorama with the microdeletions panel to all pregnant women, regardless of risk. Our clinical laboratory also holds a permit from New York’s DOH to offer our Horizon, Spectrum, Anora and non-invasive prenatal paternity tests, and provisional approval is pending for our Horizon test under our recently updated workflow. 
 Other State Laboratory Licensing Laws

 
  26

 

 In addition to New York and California, other states, including Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, require licensing of out-of-state laboratories under certain circumstances. We have obtained licenses in these three additional states and believe we are in compliance with applicable state laboratory licensing laws. 
 Potential sanctions for violation of state statutes and regulations include significant fines, the rejection of license applications, the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, and in some cases criminal penalties, which could harm our business. CLIA does not preempt state laws that have established laboratory quality standards that are at least as stringent as federal law.
 State Genetic Testing Laws 
 Many states have implemented genetic testing and privacy laws imposing specific patient consent requirements and protecting test results. In some cases, we are prohibited from conducting certain tests without appropriate documentation of patient consent by the physician ordering the test. Requirements of these laws and penalties for violations vary widely.  Cord Blood and Tissue Banking
 Our Evercord cord blood and tissue banking service is subject to FDA regulatory oversight. Pursuant to FDA regulations, an individual or entity that performs any of the manufacturing steps in banking cells or tissues, including from peripheral and cord blood (such as recovery, processing, donor screening, donor testing, storage, labeling, packaging, or distribution) must register and list with the FDA unless an exception applies, and is subject to FDA inspection. We have registered and listed with the FDA as an establishment engaged in specific manufacturing steps, including collecting cord blood and tissue samples, donor screening and distribution of cord blood hematopoietic progenitor cells, or HPCs. We have also registered with the FDA as an establishment engaged in the storage of cord blood HPCs. We have contracted with Bloodworks, another FDA-registered establishment, to perform other manufacturing steps on our behalf, which we may do as a registered establishment. As the contractor establishment, we remain responsible for ensuring that our subcontractors perform each manufacturing step in compliance with applicable requirements and are required to terminate any arrangement if our subcontractor is non-compliant. While we are not required to validate and oversee the processes of our subcontractor registered establishments, we are required to make an initial determination that the subcontractor is compliant with the applicable current good tissue practice regulations, or cGTPs, and to have policies and procedures in place to ensure that the subcontractor remains compliant throughout the term of the arrangement. We have made this determination with respect to Bloodworks and have put such procedures in place. We are also responsible for any manufacturing step performed on our behalf by an individual or entity that is not required to register with the FDA, such as the doctors and midwives who perform the collection of the cord blood and tissue. 
 We are also required to comply with cGTPs that establish a comprehensive regulatory program for human cellular and tissue-based products designed to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable disease. Cord blood and tissue stored for autologous use and for use in first- or second-degree relatives are generally regulated under 21 CFR Part 1271 as Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products and do not require approval before use.  Cord blood and tissue stored for potential future allogeneic use not in a first- or second-degree relative meets the definition of “drug” under the FDC Act and “biological product” under Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. Cord blood and tissue in this category must meet additional requirements, including conducting clinical trials pursuant to an Investigational New Drug Application and obtaining licensure pursuant to a Biologics License Application prior to marketing.
 In certain states, manufacturing steps in banking stem cells from cord blood and tissue are subject to state licensure or registration and compliance with state requirements. Certain states regulate private cord blood and/or tissue banking activities, and may require us and our subcontractors engaged in specific manufacturing steps to become licensed, permitted or registered in such states. We believe that we are licensed, permitted or registered to operate in such states as required.
 HIPAA and Other Privacy Laws 

 
  27

 

 The privacy and security regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and require certain entities, called covered entities, to comply with standards that include the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI. HIPAA further requires business associates of covered entities—independent contractors or agents of covered entities that have access to protected health information in connection with providing a service to or on behalf of a covered entity—to enter into business associate agreements with the covered entity and to safeguard the covered entity’s PHI against improper use and disclosure. In addition, certain of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards are directly applicable to business associates.
 As a covered entity and as a business associate of other covered entities (with whom we have therefore entered into business associate agreements), we have certain obligations regarding the use and disclosure of any PHI that may be provided to us, and we could incur significant liability if we fail to meet such obligations or if our business associates fail to meet such obligations. Among other things, HITECH imposes civil and criminal penalties against covered entities and business associates for noncompliance with privacy and security requirements and authorizes states’ attorneys general to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
 As noted above, we are required to comply with HIPAA standards promulgated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. First, we must comply with HIPAA’s standards for electronic transactions, which establish standards for common healthcare transactions, such as claims information, plan eligibility, payment information and the use of electronic signatures. We must also comply with the standards for the privacy of individually identifiable health information, which limit the use and disclosure of most paper and oral communications, as well as those in electronic form, regarding an individual’s past, present or future physical or mental health or condition, or relating to the provision of healthcare to the individual or payment for that healthcare, if the individual can or may be identified by such information. Additionally, we must comply with HIPAA’s security standards, which require us to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all electronic protected health information that we create, receive, maintain or transmit, to protect against reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security of such information, and to protect such information from unauthorized use or disclosure.
 Various states in the United States have implemented similar restrictive requirements regulating the use and disclosure of health information and other personally identifiable information that are not necessarily preempted by HIPAA, particularly if a state affords greater protection to individuals than HIPAA. For example, Massachusetts law requires that any company that obtains personal information of any resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts implement and maintain a security program that adequately protects such information from unauthorized use or disclosure.
 There are also foreign privacy and security laws and regulations that impose restrictions on the access, use and disclosure of health information. In particular, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies not only to organizations within the EU, but also applies to organizations outside of the EU, such as Natera, that offer goods or services to EU data subjects or that process or hold personal data of EU data subjects. The regulation specifies higher potential liabilities for certain data protection violations, and we anticipate that it will result in a greater compliance burden for us as we conduct our business, particularly through our Constellation cloud-based distribution model, in the European Union. Fines for non-compliance can range from the greater of 2% of annual global revenues or €10 million, up to the greater of 4% of annual global revenues or €20 million.
 As a business that operates both internationally and throughout the United States, any unauthorized use or disclosure of personally identifiable information, even if it does not constitute PHI, by us or our third-party contractors, including disclosure due to data theft or unauthorized access to our or our third-party contractors’ computer networks, could subject us to costs, fines or penalties that could adversely affect our business and results of operations, including the cost of providing notice, credit monitoring and identity theft prevention services to affected consumers. 
 Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws 

 
  28

 

 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it a felony for a provider or supplier, including a laboratory, to knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit or receive remuneration, directly or indirectly, in order to induce business that is reimbursable under any federal healthcare program. A violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in imprisonment for up to five years and/or criminal fines of up to $25,000, civil assessments and fines up to $50,000, and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Although the federal Anti-Kickback Statute applies only to federal healthcare programs, a number of states have passed laws substantially similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute pursuant to which similar types of prohibitions are made applicable to all other health plans and third-party payers. Actions which violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or similar laws may also involve liability under the Federal False Claims Act, which prohibits knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. Government.
 Federal and state law enforcement authorities scrutinize arrangements between healthcare providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as a mechanism to induce patient care referrals and opportunities. Law enforcement authorities, courts and Congress have demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a transaction to determine the underlying purpose of payments between healthcare providers and actual or potential referral sources. Generally, courts have taken a broad interpretation of the scope of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, holding that the statute may be violated if merely one purpose of a payment arrangement is to induce future referrals.
 The HHS Office of Inspector General, or OIG, has issued Special Fraud Alerts on arrangements  for the provision of clinical laboratory services and relationships between laboratories and referring physicians. The Fraud Alerts set forth a number of practices allegedly engaged in by some clinical laboratories and healthcare providers that raise issues under the federal fraud and abuse laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The OIG emphasized in the Special Fraud Alerts that when one purpose of such arrangements is to induce referrals of government program-reimbursed laboratory testing, both the clinical laboratory and the healthcare provider (e.g., physician) may be liable under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and may be subject to civil and/or criminal prosecution and exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 Recognizing that the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the healthcare industry, HHS has issued a series of regulatory ‘‘safe harbors’’ which provide confidence to healthcare providers and other parties that they may not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute if they can demonstrate compliance with each element of the safe harbor. Although full compliance with these provisions ensures against prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued.
 While we believe that we are in compliance with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or similar laws, there can be no assurance that our relationships with physicians, hospitals and other customers will not be subject to scrutiny or will survive regulatory challenge under such laws. If imposed for any reason, sanctions under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or any similar state statute could have a negative effect on our business.
 Because our laboratory is located in California and licensed by California’s DHS, California law is applicable to our business arrangements. California’s state anti-kickback statutes, Business and Professions Code Section 650 (which applies to all categories of payors) and Insurance Code Section 754, and its Medi-Cal anti-kickback statute, Welfare and Institutions Code Section 14107.2, are analogous to, and have been interpreted by the California Attorney General and California courts in substantially the same way as the federal government and the courts have interpreted, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. A violation of Section 650 is punishable by up to one year of imprisonment, a fine up to $50,000, or both imprisonment and a fine. A violation of Section 14107.2 is punishable by imprisonment and fines of up to $10,000. The California Insurance Code includes similar prohibitions against any consideration for the referral or procurement of patients if a claim is submitted to a commercial insurer, CA Ins. Code § 750, which is punishable by criminal penalties mirroring those that apply to violations of Business and Professions Code Section 650.

 
  29

 

 Because our laboratory holds a New York CLEP permit, we must comply with New York state laboratory statutes and regulations, which include anti-kickback provisions, Public Health Law Section 587, and Medicaid anti-kickback provisions, 18 NYCRR Section 515.2, related to laboratory services. The New York DOH may suspend, limit, revoke or annul the New York laboratory permit or otherwise discipline the permit holder for a violation.
 In addition to the requirements that are discussed above, there are other healthcare fraud and abuse laws that could have an impact on our business. The federal False Claims Act prohibits a person from knowingly submitting or causing to be submitted false claims or making a false record or statement in order to secure payment by the federal government. Actions which violate another law in this section may also result in liability under the Federal False Claims Act as a result of the submission of claims pursuant to a prohibited arrangement. In addition to actions initiated by the government itself, the statute authorizes actions to be brought on behalf of the federal government by a private party having knowledge of the alleged fraud sometimes referred to as a ‘‘whistleblower’’.
 Because the complaints are initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before the defendant is even aware of the action. If the government is ultimately successful in obtaining redress in the matter or if the private party plaintiff succeeds in obtaining redress without the government’s involvement, then the private party plaintiff will receive a percentage of the recovery. Violation of the federal False Claims Act may result in fines of up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of up to approximately $22,000 for each separate false claim, imprisonment or both, and possible exclusion from Medicare or Medicaid.
 In October of 2018, the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018, or EKRA, was passed as part of the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (referred to as the SUPPORT Act). Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback statute, EKRA creates criminal penalties for knowing or willful payment or offer, or solicitation or receipt, of any remuneration, whether directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for the referral or inducement of laboratory testing unless a specific exception applies. Unlike the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, EKRA is not limited to government health care benefit programs, so the prohibitions extend to services covered by private payors. Additionally, most of the safe harbors available under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are not reiterated under EKRA. Therefore, compliance with a federal Anti-Kickback safe harbor does not guarantee protection under EKRA. As currently drafted, EKRA potentially expands the universe of arrangements that could be subject to government enforcement under federal fraud and abuse laws. Violation of EKRA carries potential penalties of up to $200,000 in fines and imprisonment of up to 10 years for each occurrence. Because EKRA is a new law, there is very little additional guidance to indicate how and to what extent it will be applied and enforced by government agencies in our industry. We cannot assure you that our relationships with physicians, sales representatives, hospitals or customers will not be subject to scrutiny or will survive regulatory challenge under such laws. If imposed for any reason, sanctions under the EKRA could have a negative effect on our business.
 We are also subject to a federal law directed at “self-referrals,” commonly known as the Stark  Law, which prohibits, with certain exceptions, payments made by a laboratory to a physician in exchange for the referral of clinical laboratory services, or presenting or causing to be presented claims to Medicare and Medicaid for laboratory tests referred by physicians who personally, or through a family member, have an investment interest in, or a compensation arrangement with, the clinical laboratory performing the tests. A person who engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s referral prohibition may be fined up to $100,000 for each such arrangement or scheme. In addition, any person who presents or causes to be presented a claim to the Medicare or Medicaid programs in violation of the Stark Law is subject to civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 per claim submission, an assessment of up to three times the amount claimed, and possible exclusion from participation in federal governmental payer programs. Claims submitted in violation of the Stark Law may not be paid by Medicare or Medicaid, and any person collecting any amounts with respect to any such prohibited claim is obligated to refund such amounts.
 Many states, including California, also have state “physician self-referral” prohibitions and other laws that are not limited to Medicare and Medicaid referrals, with which we must comply. We are subject to California’s Physician Ownership and Referral Act, or PORA, under Article 6 of the California Business & Professions Code. PORA generally prohibits us from billing a patient or any governmental or private payer for any laboratory services when the physician ordering the service, or any member of such physician’s immediate family, has a “financial interest” with us, unless the 

 
  30

 
arrangement meets an exception. The term “financial interest” is defined broadly and includes any type of ownership interest, debt, loan, lease, compensation, remuneration, discount, rebate, refund, etc. between the ordering physician and the entity receiving the referral. The exceptions to PORA track certain of the Stark Law exceptions, including an exception for personal service arrangements and for ownership of publicly traded entities. A violation of PORA is punishable by civil and criminal penalties (civil penalties and criminal fines vary depending on the nature of the violation, but may reach up to $15,000 per violation).
 Other states may have self-referral restrictions with which we have to comply that differ from those imposed by federal and California law.
 We are also subject to applicable state client billing laws (also known as “pass through billing”), which specify whether a provider that did not perform the service is permitted to submit the claim for payment and if so, whether the non-performing provider is permitted to mark up the cost of the services in excess of the price the purchasing provider paid for such services. California has an anti-markup statute with which we must comply, which prohibits providers from charging for a laboratory test that it did not perform unless the provider (a) notifies the patient of the name, address, and charges of the laboratory performing the test, and (b) charges no more than what he or she was charged by the clinical laboratory which performed the test except for any other service actually rendered to the patient by the provider (Business and Professions Code Section 655.5). A violation of this provision can lead to imprisonment and/or a fine of up to $10,000. Other states have similar anti-markup prohibitions with which we must comply. In addition, many states also have “direct-bill” laws, which means that the services actually performed by an individual or entity must be billed by such individual or entity, thus preventing ordering physicians from purchasing services from a laboratory and billing for the services they order. For example, California has a direct bill rule specific to anatomic pathology services that prohibits any provider from billing for anatomic pathology services if those services were not actually rendered by that person or under his or her direct supervision with some exemptions (Business and Professions Code Section 655.7).
 While we have attempted to comply with the federal fraud and abuse laws, California and New York fraud and abuse laws and similar laws of other states and non-U.S. jurisdictions, it is possible that some of our arrangements could be subject to regulatory scrutiny at some point in the future, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be found to be in compliance with these laws following any such regulatory review.
 Further, in addition to the privacy and security regulations stated above, HIPAA created two federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payers. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment.
 Finally, federal law prohibits any entity from offering or transferring to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration that the entity knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services, including waivers of copayments and deductible amounts (or any part thereof) and transfers of items or services for free or for other than fair market value. Entities found in violation may be liable for civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each wrongful act. Although we believe that our practices, including our sales and marketing practices, are in material compliance with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations, relevant regulatory authorities may disagree, and violation of these laws or our exclusion from such programs as Medicaid and other governmental programs as a result of a violation of such laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 975 employees, including 310 in laboratory operations and manufacturing administration, 148 in research and development and 517 in sales, general and administrative functions. We have not been subject to labor action or union activities, and our management considers its relationships with employees to be good.

    Natera, Inc.
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
     1.    Description of Business
     Natera, Inc. (the "Company") was formed in the state of California as Gene Security Network, LLC in November 2003 and incorporated in the state of Delaware in January 2007. The Company’s mission is to change the management of genetic disease worldwide. The Company operates a laboratory certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ("CLIA") providing a host of preconception and prenatal genetic testing services. The Company determines its operating segments based on the way it organizes its business to make operating decisions and assess performance. The Company has only one operating segment, which is the discovery, development and commercialization of genetic testing services, and it has a subsidiary that operates in the state of Texas. 
     The Company's product offerings include its Panorama Non-Invasive Prenatal Test ("NIPT") that screens for chromosomal abnormalities of a fetus typically with a blood draw from the mother; Vistara (“Vistara”), a single-gene mutations screening test performed to identify single-gene disorders; Horizon Carrier Screening ("HCS") to determine carrier status for a large number of severe genetic diseases that could be passed on to the carrier’s children; Spectrum Pre-implantation Genetic Screening ("PGS") and Spectrum Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis ("PGD") to analyze chromosomal anomalies or inherited genetic conditions during an in vitro fertilization ("IVF") cycle to select embryos with the highest probability of becoming healthy children; Anora Products of Conception ("POC") test to rapidly and extensively analyze fetal chromosomes to understand the cause of miscarriage; Non-Invasive Paternity Testing ("PAT"), to determine paternity by analyzing the fragments of fetal deoxyribonucleic acid ("DNA") in a pregnant mother's blood and a blood sample from the alleged father(s), which is marketed and sold by a licensee from whom the Company receives a royalty. All testing is available principally in the United States, and the Company also offers its Panorama test to customers primarily in Europe. The Company also offers Constellation (“Constellation”), a cloud-based software product that allows laboratory customers to gain access through the cloud to the Company’s algorithms and bioinformatics in order to validate and launch tests based on the Company’s technology. The Company also offers Evercord, which is a cord blood and cord tissue processing and storage service; and SignateraTM, a circulating tumor DNA technology that analyzes and tracks mutations specific to an individual’s tumor, for research use only by oncology researchers and biopharmaceutical companies. Further, the Company has expanded its Panorama test to now screen twin pregnancies for zygosity and chromosomal abnormalities.
             2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
     Basis of Presentation
     The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”).
     Liquidity Matters
     The Company has incurred net losses since its inception and anticipates net losses and negative operating cash flows for the near future. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company had a net loss of $128.2 million, which increased the accumulated deficit to $574.6 million from $446.4 million at December 31, 2017 following the full retrospective adoption of ASU 2014-09, which required a cumulative-effect adjustment to be recorded to accumulated deficit as of the earliest period presented in the consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2018, the Company had $46.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, $107.5 million in marketable securities, $50.2 million of outstanding balance of the Credit Line (as defined in Note 9) including accrued interest, and $73.4 million of net carrying amount of the 2017 Term Loan (as defined in Note 9). While the Company has introduced multiple products that are generating revenues, these revenues have not been sufficient to fund all operations. Accordingly, the Company has funded the portion of operating costs that exceeds revenues through a combination of equity issuances, debt issuances, and financing under the 2017 Term Loan with an option to borrow an additional $50.0 million.
    
 
  100

 

 The Company continues to develop and commercialize future products and, consequently, it will need to generate additional revenues to achieve future profitability and may need to raise additional equity or debt financing. If the Company raises additional funds by issuing equity securities, its stockholders would experience dilution. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting its operations or its ability to incur additional debt. Any additional debt financing or additional equity that the Company raises may contain terms that are not favorable to it or its stockholders and require significant debt service payments, which diverts resources from other activities. Additional financing may not be available at all, or in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company. If the Company is unable to obtain additional financing, it may be required to delay the development, commercialization and marking of its products and significantly scale back its business and operations.  
     In July 2018, the Company completed an equity offering to sell 4,500,000 shares of its common stock to the public at a price of $20 per share, along with the sale of 675,000 additional shares of its common stock to the underwriters upon their exercise of the option to purchase those shares. Upon the closing of the equity offering, the Company received proceeds of $97.3 million before offering expenses, which totaled approximately $0.5 million.
     Based on the Company’s current business plan, the Company believes that its existing cash and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash requirements for at least 12 months after March 15, 2019.
     Principles of Consolidation
     The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary. The Company established a subsidiary that operates in the state of Texas to support the Company’s laboratory and operational functions. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.     Use of Estimates
     The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Significant items subject to such estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, deferred revenues associated with unsatisfied performance obligations, accrued liability for potential refund requests, stock-based compensation, the fair value of common stock and warrants, income tax uncertainties, and the expected consideration to be received from contracts with customers. These estimates and assumptions are based on management's best estimates and judgment. Management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions using historical experience and other factors, including contractual terms and statutory limits; however, actual results could differ from these estimates and could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial statements. 
     For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company revised the estimate of its expected consideration for certain genetic test services as the amounts collected from its payers were different than what was initially assessed. The revision of the estimate was treated as a change in accounting estimate. See Note 3 for more detail on this accounting change and its resulting impact on the Company’s financial statements.  
     Fair Value
     The Company discloses the fair value of financial instruments for financial assets and liabilities for which the value is practicable to estimate. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).     Cash and Cash Equivalents
     Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and money market deposits with financial institutions.

 Restricted Cash
     As of December 31, 2018, the Company had restricted cash primarily consisting of $4.2 million in cash deposits held to secure a letter of credit associated with a settlement agreement in connection with reimbursement related claims (as described in Note 7 under Legal Proceedings) and $0.3 million of deposit per credit card terms.  
     The Company adopted Accounting Standard Update No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (“ASU 2016-18”), effective January 1, 2018, which required the change in restricted cash to be included as part of the total cash and cash equivalents. While restricted cash is still presented as a separate line item in the Company’s balance sheet, it is no longer presented as a separate item in the statements of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 also required a restatement of the statements of cash flows in the prior period presented to report this change.  The following is the reconciliation between how restricted cash is presented in the balance sheet and the statements of cash flows for all periods presented:
    
 | December 31, | | December 31, | | December 31, | December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | 2015 
 | (in thousands)
Cash and cash equivalents in balance sheet | $ | 46,407 | | $ | 12,620 | $ | 15,256 | $ | 28,947
Restricted cash, current portion in balance sheet | | 4,597 | | | 59 | | 1,092 | | 901 
Restricted cash in other assets in balance sheet | | — | | | 342 | | 342 | | 683 
Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in statements of cash flows | $ | 51,004 | | $ | 13,021 | $ | 16,690 | $ | 30,531

          Investments
     Investments consist primarily of debt securities such as U.S. Treasuries, U.S. agency and municipal bonds. Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company generally classifies its entire investment portfolio as available-for-sale. The Company views its available-for-sale portfolio as available for use in current operations. Accordingly, the Company classifies all investments as short-term, even though the stated maturity may be more than one year from the current balance sheet date. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is a separate component of stockholders’ equity.      Risk and Uncertainties
     The Company has various financial instruments that are potentially subjected to credit risk, and they consist of cash, accounts receivable and investments. The Company limits its exposure to credit loss by placing its cash in financial institutions with high credit ratings. The Company's cash may consist of deposits held with banks that may at times exceed federally insured limits. The Company performs evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one institution. 
     The Company bills third-party payers for certain tests performed. The amount that is ultimately received from the payer for the Company’s claim and the timing of such payments are subject to the determination of the payer based on the nature of the test performed and their view of the Company’s business practices with respect to collections of plan deductibles and co-payments from patients and other activities. This determination can impact both the amount and timing of when the Company’s invoices are collected. Payers may also withhold payments and request refunds of prior payments if the payer asserts that the Company has not performed in accordance with the policies of these payers. 
     The Company performs evaluations of financial conditions for clinics and laboratory partners and generally does not require collateral to support credit sales. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, there were no customers exceeding 10% of total revenues on an individual basis. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no customers with an outstanding balance exceeding 10% of net accounts receivable. 

 
  102

 

     Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
     Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the amount billed to the laboratory partners and clinics. Reducing this amount is an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make the contracted payments. Management analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, and changes in customer payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable are written off against the allowance when there is substantive evidence that the account will not be paid.     Revenue Recognition
     The Company adopted the new revenue recognition guidance, ASC 606, beginning January 1, 2018 on a full retrospective basis. ASC 606 mandates revenue recognition to be evaluated using the following five steps:
· | Identification of a contract, or contracts, with a customer;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


· | Determination of the transaction price;
--+----------------------------------------


· | Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Revenue recognition when, or as, the performance obligations are satisfied
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     
See Note 3, Revenue Recognition, for detailed discussions of product revenues, licensing and other revenues, and how the five steps described above are applied.
     Cost of Product Revenues
     The components of cost of product revenues are material and service costs, impairment charges associated with testing equipment, personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, equipment and infrastructure expenses associated with testing samples, electronic medical record, order and delivery systems, shipping charges to transport samples, third-party test processing fees and allocated overhead including rent, information technology costs, equipment depreciation and utilities. Costs associated with the performance of diagnostic services are recorded as tests are accessioned.     Cost of Licensing and Other Revenues 
     The components of cost of licensing and other revenues are material costs associated with test kits, engineering costs incurred by the research and development team to improve and maintain the Constellation software platform, and amortization of Constellation software development costs. Costs also include collection kits consumed during the processing of cord blood samples, processing service and storage of the cord blood samples, and freight charged to transport the samples to the storage facility.      Research and Development 
     The Company records research and development costs in the period incurred. Research and development costs consist of personnel costs, contract services, cost of materials utilized in performing tests, costs of clinical trials and allocated facilities and related overhead expenses.      Advertising Costs 
     The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. The Company incurred advertising costs of $0.2 million, $0.5 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
    
 
  103

 

 Product Shipment Costs 
     The Company expenses product shipment costs in cost of product revenues in the accompanying statements of operations. Shipping and handling costs for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $12.4 million, $9.5 million and $8.2 million, respectively.       Income Taxes 
     Income taxes are recorded in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ("ASC 740"), which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Tax benefits are recognized when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained during an audit. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if current evidence indicates that it is considered more likely than not that these benefits will not be realized.
     Stock‑Based Compensation
     Stock‑based compensation related to stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted to the Company’s employees is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The fair value is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. No compensation cost is recognized when the requisite service has not been met and the awards are therefore forfeited. 
     The Company uses the Black‑Scholes option‑pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options issued to employees and non-employees. The measurement of stock-based compensation is subject to periodic adjustments as the underlying equity instruments vest, and the resulting change in value, if any, is recognized in the Company's statements of operations and comprehensive loss during the period that the related services are rendered.
     The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of the Company's expected stock price volatility, the expected term of the awards, and a risk-free interest rate. Determining these assumptions requires significant judgment. The expected term was based on the simplified method and the volatility rate was based on that of publicly traded companies in the DNA sequencing, diagnostics, or personalized medicine industries. When selecting the public companies in these industries to be used in the volatility calculation, companies were selected with comparable characteristics to the Company, including enterprise value and financial leverage. Companies were also selected with historical share price volatility sufficient to meet the expected term of the Company's stock options. The historical volatility data was computed using the daily closing prices for the selected companies' shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of the Company's stock options. The expected term of the non-employee option grants was based on their remaining contractual life at the measurement date. The risk-free interest rate assumption was based on U.S. Treasury instruments with maturities that were consistent with the option's expected term. 
     Starting January 1, 2016, the Company began using a different approach to estimate the expected term of its stock option awards, which involves calculating the average of—(1) its employees’ historical stock option exercise behavior, and (2) the weighted-average of the time-to-vesting and the total contractual life of the options. The Company applied this change in methodology prospectively and accounted for it as a change in accounting estimate.
     Warrants
     The Company accounts for warrants to purchase shares of its common stock as a liability at fair value on the balance sheet date because the Company may be obligated to redeem these warrants at some point in the future. The warrants are subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date, with changes in fair value recognized as a gain or loss from the changes in fair value of the warrants in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Further adjustments resulting from changes in fair value are no longer required as the warrants were fully exercised in June 2018.

 Capitalized Software Held for Internal Use 
     The Company capitalizes salaries and related costs of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internal-use software development projects. Capitalization begins during the application development stage, once the preliminary project stage has been completed, which includes successful validation and approval from management. If a project constitutes an enhancement to previously developed software, the Company assesses whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software, thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization. Once the project is available for general release, capitalization ceases and the Company estimates the useful life of the asset and begins amortization. The Company periodically assesses whether triggering events are present to review internal-use software for impairment. Changes in estimates related to internal-use software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the reporting period. Refer to Property and Equipment, net under Note 6 for more detail regarding an impairment charge recorded to write off certain project development costs during the first quarter of 2018.
     The Company amortizes its internal-use software over the estimated useful lives of three years. The net book value of capitalized software held for internal use was $1.7 million and $2.6 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Amortized expense for amounts previously capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $1.3 million, $1.0 million and $0.6 million, respectively. 
     Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
     Comprehensive loss and its components encompass all changes in equity other than those with stockholders, and include net loss, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale marketable securities. As of December 31, 2018, and 2017, accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted of $0.6 million and $0.8 million of unrealized losses on available-for-sale marketable securities. See Note 5 for additional disclosures related to change in net unrealized losses and reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive loss upon the sale of available-for-sale marketable securities.       Property and Equipment
     Property and equipment, including purchased and internally developed software, are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are generally three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining term of the lease, whichever is shorter. The Company periodically reviews the depreciable lives assigned to property and equipment placed in service and change the estimates of useful lives to reflect the results of such reviews.       Impairment of Long-lived Assets
     The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company then compares the carrying amounts of the assets with the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such asset. Should an impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying value of the asset over the asset’s fair value determined using discounted estimates of future cash flows. See Note 6 for more detail about assets impairment.       Inventory 
     Inventory is valued at the lower of the standard cost, which approximates actual cost, or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. Inventory consists entirely of supplies, which are consumed when providing its test reports, and therefore does not maintain any finished goods inventory. The Company enters into inventory purchases and commitments so that it can meet future delivery schedules based on forecasted demand for its tests.
     The Company recorded inventory obsolescence charges totaling $0.3 million, $0.5 million, and $2.1 million in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements
     From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) under its accounting standard codifications (“ASC”) or other standard setting bodies and adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed below, the Company believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations upon adoption.     Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
     In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09, which defines the core principles of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (“ASC 606”), establishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. ASC 606 also impacts the accounting for costs incurred in obtaining a contract with a customer, provided that such costs are considered incremental and recoverable by the Company.
 Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 using the full retrospective approach. The Company revised the financial results in its statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and balance sheet as of December 31, 2017, as if ASC 606 had been effective for those periods. The adoption of ASC 606 resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment of approximately $41.7 million recorded retroactively to accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2015. The impact of adopting the new guidance on total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was a decrease of $1.3 million and $4.6 million, respectively. For financial statement disclosure purposes, the Company elected one of the practical expedients under ASC 606 to forego disclosures related to the allocation of consideration to the remaining performance obligations and the timing in which revenues will be recognized from such performance obligations.
 Upon the adoption of ASC 606, the Company revised the following selected amounts in its consolidated balance sheet from amounts previously reported:
    
 | December 31, 2017
 | As Previously | | Adoption of | | 
 | Reported | | ASC 606 | | As Revised

          The Company restated the following selected amounts in its consolidated statements of cash flows from amounts previously reported as a result of the adoption of ASC 606, as well as the adoption of ASU 2016-18 regarding the new financial statement presentation requirements for restricted cash:

          In November 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (“ASU 2016-18”). The new guidance requires restricted cash to be combined with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and ending balances of cash on the statement of cash flows. Further, the new guidance requires the nature of the restrictions to be disclosed, as well as a reconciliation between the balance sheet and the statement of cash flows on how restricted and unrestricted cash are segregated. The Company adopted this new guidance beginning January 1, 2018 and retroactively adjusted the statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 to show the combined result of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash.
 In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (A Consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force) (“ASU 2016-15”). The purpose of ASU 2016-15 is to limit diversity in the classification of certain transactions in the statement of cash flows. Such transactions include (1) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, (2) settlement of zero-coupon bonds, (3) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, (4) proceeds from insurance claims settlement, (5) proceeds from settlement of life insurance policies, and (6) distributions of equity method investments. The Company adopted this new guidance beginning January 1, 2018, which did not result in a material impact on its financial statements as none of the transactions described above occurred during the year ended December 31, 2018.        In May 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-09 (“ASU 2017-09”), Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting. The purpose of this ASU is to clarify when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification. Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions. The Company adopted this new guidance beginning January 1, 2018, and the impact on its financial statements was not material upon adoption. 
 New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
      In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (“ASU 2016-02”). ASU 2016-02 is aimed at making leasing activities more transparent and comparable, and requires substantially all leases be recognized by lessees on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, including leases currently accounted for as operating leases. In July 2018, the FASB also issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements, which provides an alternative by allowing a cumulative-effect adjustment to be recorded in the opening retained earnings balance as of January 1, 2019 instead of the earliest period presented, and can be adopted concurrently with ASU 2016-02. These two accounting standard updates are collectively known as ASC 842. In preparation for a proper transition to ASC 842, the Company has designated a project implementation team to assess the scope of the accounting and explore opportunities to reduce the extent and complexity of such work by utilizing certain practical expedients under the new guidance. Upon the election of such practical expedients, the Company will be allowed to forego reassessment of the lease classification of an expired or existing lease agreement, whether an expired or existing agreement contains a lease, exclude any lease agreement with a term less than 12 months from the transition, and record a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the effective date of January 1, 2019 instead of the earliest period presented in the financial statements.

 The Company is in the process of finalizing its analysis and expects the amounts to be recorded for its right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities to be material upon the adoption of ASC 842 using the modified retrospective approach. 
     In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets by requiring an allowance to be recorded as an offset to the amortized cost of such assets. For available-for-sale debt securities, expected credit losses should be estimated when the fair value of the debt securities is below their associated amortized costs. ASU 2016-13 will become effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning the first quarter of 2019. The modified retrospective approach should be applied upon adoption of this new guidance. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-13 on its financial statements. 
 In February 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-02, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“ASU 2018-02”). This new guidance was established as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December 2017, which provides an opportunity for entities to reclassify residual income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings due to the reduction of the corporate income tax rate. The new guidance will be effective in the first quarter of 2019, and interim periods within that year, with early adoption permitted. The Company will have the option to apply this new guidance using either the full retrospective approach or to record the reclassifications as of the beginning date in the period of adoption. The Company does not expect the impact of adopting ASU 2018-02 to be material to its financial statements given that the deferred tax assets are fully reserved by a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2018. 
 In June 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-07, Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting (“ASU 2018-07”). ASU 2018-07 is intended to reduce the cost and complexity and to improve financial reporting for nonemployee share-based payments. ASU 2018-07 expands the scope of Topic 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation (which currently only includes share-based payments to employees) to include share-based payments issued to nonemployees for goods or services. Consequently, the accounting for share-based payments to nonemployees and employees will be substantially aligned. ASU 2018-07 supersedes Subtopic 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. ASU 2018-07 is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the impact of adopting this new guidance to be material to its financial statements. 
 In August 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework—Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement (“ASU 2018-13”). ASU 2018-13 proposes new disclosure requirements for unrealized gains or losses recognized in other comprehensive income that are attributable to fair value changes in assets and liabilities categorized within Level III of the fair value hierarchy, as well as quantitative information about significant unobservable inputs used to value such assets and liabilities. It eliminates the requirement to disclose the reasons for the transfers of assets and liabilities measured in fair value on a recurring basis between Level I and Level II. ASU 2018-13 is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that fiscal year, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.
 In August 2018, the SEC adopted amendments to certain disclosure requirements in Securities Act Release No. 33-10532, Disclosure Update and Simplification. These amendments eliminate, modify, or integrate into other SEC requirements certain disclosure rules. Among the amendments is the requirement to present an analysis of changes in stockholders’ equity in the interim financial statements included in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The analysis, which can be presented as a footnote or separate statement, is required for the current and comparative quarter and year-to-date interim periods. The amendments are effective for all filings made on or after November 5, 2018. In light of the anticipated timing of effectiveness of the amendments and expected proximity of effectiveness to the filing date for most filers’ quarterly reports, the SEC’s Division of Corporate Finance issued a Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation related to Exchange Act Forms, or CDI – Question 105.09, that provides transition guidance related to this disclosure requirement. CDI – Question 105.09 states that the SEC would not object if the filer’s first presentation of the changes in shareholders’ 

 
  109

 
equity is included in its Form 10-Q for the quarter that begins after the effective date of the amendments. As such, the Company adopted these SEC amendments on November 5, 2018 and will present the analysis of changes in stockholders’ equity in its interim financial statements in its March 31, 2019 Form 10-Q. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of these SEC amendments will have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, cash flows or shareholders’ equity. 
 In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-18, Collaborative Arrangements (Topic 808): Clarifying the Interaction between Topic 808 and Topic 606, which clarifies that certain transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement should be accounted for under ASC 606 when the counterparty is a customer. In addition, Topic 808 precludes an entity from presenting consideration from a transaction in a collaborative arrangement as revenue from contracts with customers if the counterparty is not a customer for that transaction. This guidance will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2020. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. 
     3.    Revenue Recognition
    
The Company recognizes revenues when, or as, performance obligations in the contracts are satisfied, in the amount reflecting the expected consideration to be received from the goods or services transferred to the customers.     Product Revenues
    
Product revenues are derived from contracts with insurance carriers, laboratory partners and patients in connection with sales of prenatal genetic tests. The majority of the Company’s revenues is derived from Panorama NIPT, HCS (as defined in Note 1), and to a lesser extent, other genetic tests. The Company enters into contracts with insurance carriers with primarily payment terms related to tests provided to the patients who have health insurance coverage. Insurance carriers are considered as third-party payers on behalf of the patients, and the patients are considered as the customers who receive genetic test services. Tests may be billed to insurance carriers, patients, or a combination of insurance carriers and patients. Further, the Company sells tests to a number of domestic and international laboratory partners and identifies the laboratory partners as customers provided that there is a test services agreement between the two parties.
     A performance obligation represents a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer, which represents a unit of accounting in accordance with ASC 606.  A portion of the consideration should be allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The Company evaluates its contracts with insurance carriers, laboratory partners and patients and identifies a single performance obligation in those contracts, which is the delivery of the test results.
     The total consideration which the Company expects to collect in exchange for the Company’s products is an estimate and may be fixed or variable. Consideration includes reimbursement from both patients and insurance carriers, adjusted for variable consideration related to disallowed cases, discounts, refunds and doubtful accounts, and is estimated using the expected value approach. For insurance carriers with similar reimbursement characteristics, the Company uses a portfolio of relevant historical data to estimate variable consideration and total collections for the Company’s products. The Company constrains the estimated variable consideration when it assesses it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized may occur in future periods. The consideration expected from laboratory partners usually includes a fixed amount, but it can be variable depending on the volume of tests performed, and the Company determines the variable consideration using the expected value approach. For insurance carriers, laboratory partners and patients, the Company allocates the total consideration to a single performance obligation, which is the delivery of the test results to the customers.
     When assessing the total consideration for insurance carriers and patients, a certain percentage of revenues is further constrained for estimated refunds.
    
 
  110

 

 The Company generally bills an insurance carrier, a laboratory partner or a patient upon delivery of test results. The Company also bills patients directly for out-of-pocket costs involving co-pays and deductibles that they are responsible for. Tests billed to insurance carriers and directly to patients usually take an average of nine to twelve months to collect the payments, and for tests billed to laboratory distribution partners, the average collection cycle takes approximately two to three months. At times, the Company may or may not get reimbursed for the full amount billed. Further, the Company may not get reimbursed at all for tests performed if such tests are not covered under the insurance carrier’s reimbursement policies or the Company is not a qualified provider to the insurance carrier, or if the tests were not previously authorized.
     Product revenue is recognized in an amount that equals to the total consideration (as described above) at a point in time when the test results are delivered. The Company reserves certain amounts in other accrued liabilities on the balance sheet in anticipation of requests for refunds of payments previously made by insurance carriers, which are accounted for as reductions in product revenues in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, $3.3 million and $4.9 million, respectively, were released from amounts previously held in reserves in other accrued liabilities and recognized as product revenue. There were no amounts released from the reserves during the year ended December 31, 2016.
     Licensing and Other Revenues
    
The Company recognizes licensing revenues from its cloud-based distribution service offering, Constellation, by granting licenses to its licensees to use certain of the Company’s proprietary intellectual properties and cloud-based software. The Company also recognizes revenues from Evercord for the collection and storage of newborn cord blood and cord tissue units.      Constellation
    
The laboratory partners with which the Company enters into a licensing arrangement represent the licensees and are identified as customers. The licensees do not have the right to possess the Company’s software, but rather receive the software as a service. These arrangements often include: (i) the delivery of the software as a service, (ii) the necessary support and training, and (iii) the reagent kits (“IVD kits”) to be consumed as tests are processed. The Company does not consider the software as a service, the support and training as being distinct in the context of such arrangements, and therefore they are combined as a single performance obligation. The software, support and training are delivered simultaneously to the licensees over the term of the arrangement.

The Company provides IVD kits that are customized for its licensees to process tests using its cloud-based software. IVD kits revenues are recognized based on their standalone selling price at a point in time upon delivery to the licensees and expiration of their right of return.

The Company bills the majority of licensees, who process the tests in their laboratories, a fixed price for each test processed. Licensing revenues are recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied over time and reported in licensing and other revenues in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
 Evercord
    
The Company recognizes revenues from Evercord for the collection and storage of newborn cord blood and cord tissue units. The patient enters into an enrollment agreement with the Company. According to the agreement, there are two performance obligations: (i) the provision of a collection kit and the processing of newborn cord blood and cord tissue units, which are considered delivered at the beginning of the process (the “processing services”), and (ii) the storage of the cord blood and cord tissue units (the “storage services”), for either an annual fee or a prepayment covering an extended period or the lifetime of the newborn donor.
    
The Company offers its processing services together with storage services, and each of them is capable of being distinct, and is distinct in the context of the contract, and therefore, represents separate performance obligations. Evercord customers may pay for both processing and storage services over a period of six, 12, or 18 months. The transaction price for the processing and storage services is calculated as the stated contract price, adjusted for discounts, refunds, and 

 
  111

 
significant financing components. The Company determines estimated standalone selling prices based on transaction price and observable prices in the market for both the processing and storage services. The total consideration is allocated between the processing services and storage services based on their estimated standalone selling prices.
    
Upon the completion of the processing services, the Company issues a certificate of preservation indicating that the cord blood and cord tissue units are ready for storage, and processing revenues are recognized at this particular point in time. Storage revenues are recognized over time, which is the applicable storage period. The Company believes the methodology of recognizing storage revenues over time meaningfully depicts the timing of storage services delivered to customers as it exerts the necessary efforts to deliver such services equally over time. Evercord revenues are reported in licensing and other revenues in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
     Qiagen       
In March 2018, the Company entered into a License, Development and Distribution Agreement (“the Qiagen Agreement”) with Qiagen under which the Company granted Qiagen a license to develop, manufacture, distribute and commercialize NGS-based genetic testing assays and sequencing systems utilizing such assays, which incorporate the Company’s proprietary technology. According to the terms of the agreement, the Company is initially entitled to receive an upfront license fee and prepaid royalties totaling $40.0 million. All or a portion of the prepaid royalties are refundable in limited circumstances. In addition, the Company is entitled to potential milestone payments from Qiagen upon the achievement of certain volume, regulatory and commercial milestones, and tiered royalties. The Qiagen Agreement has a term of 10 years and expires in March 2028, and it may be terminated earlier in certain circumstances. Upon termination of the Qiagen Agreement, the license granted to Qiagen will also terminate, except in certain limited circumstances. The Company provided to Qiagen standard indemnification protections, which is part of an assurance that the license meets the contract’s specifications and is not an obligation to provide goods or services. 
    
The Company identified the following goods and services in the agreement that it concluded were distinct performance obligations:

Technology license. The Company granted the right to Qiagen to use its proprietary intellectual properties (“technology license”) to develop, manufacture, distribute and commercialize genetic testing assays and sequencing systems in certain countries. The technology license was transferred to Qiagen at the inception of this agreement when the license became effective and the technology transfer was completed.

Development services. The Company is responsible for providing certain support services to assist Qiagen in its design and development of the genetic test assays.

Market development support. The Company is required to support Qiagen’s market development for the genetic testing assays.

Option to expand commercialization to another country. The Company has provided an option to Qiagen to expand the commercialization of its genetic testing assays to another country following all of the necessary regulatory approvals.

The initial transaction price was estimated to be $15.0 million based on the most likely amount approach, which was comprised of the upfront non-refundable fee and a payment associated with the initial milestone under the agreement. The remaining milestone and prepaid royalty amounts were not included in the transaction price due to the uncertainties of research and development and the potential for prepaid royalty refund, as it is not currently probable that the associated revenue, if recognized, would not be reversed later. Royalties, including prepaid royalties, will generally not be recognized until earned. The allocation of the transaction price was performed based on standalone selling prices, which are based on estimated amounts that the Company would charge for a performance obligation if it were sold separately. Future variable consideration such as milestones and royalties is considered associated with the technology license performance obligation. The amounts included in the initial transaction price were allocated to the remaining value of the technology license, as well as development services, market development support and the option to expand commercialization using the relative standalone selling price approach. The amount initially allocated to the technology license was $5.5 million.

 
  112

 


For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized revenue of approximately $5.8 million related to support services provided and the delivery of its technology license to Qiagen.

In accordance with ASC 340-40, any incremental costs incurred to obtain a contract with a customer are required to be capitalized and amortized over the period in which the goods and services are transferred to the customer. The Company has elected to apply a practical expedient under ASC 340-40 to recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred provided that the amortization period of such costs, if capitalized, is one year or less.
 Disaggregation of Revenues
    
The primary source of the Company’s revenues relates to the sale of prenatal genetic tests. The Company also recognizes licensing revenues from its cloud-based software platform, Constellation and other revenues. The following table shows disaggregation of revenues by types of products and services, with sales of genetic tests further disaggregated by test families:
 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 
(Amounts in thousands) | | | | (As Revised) | | (As Revised)
Sales of genetic tests | | | | | | | |

Total revenues | $ | 257,654 | | $ | 209,625 | | $ | 212,512

     
The Company measures its performance results primarily based on revenues recognized from the three categories described below. The following table shows disaggregation of revenues by payer types:
    
 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 
(Amounts in thousands) | | | | (As Revised) | | (As Revised)

  113

 


The Company recognizes revenue from billings to insurance carriers and patients based on estimates of the amount that will ultimately be realized (“expected consideration”). The expected consideration estimated for genetic test services is based on many factors such as length of payer relationship, historical collection trends, changes in contract provisions and insurance reimbursement policies. Cash collections for certain tests delivered may differ from the expected consideration originally estimated. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company’s collections substantially improved. As a result of this, the Company updated its estimate of the amounts to be recognized for previously delivered tests which resulted in an additional $10.2 million of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. These changes in estimates decreased the Company’s loss from operations by $10.2 million and decreased basic and diluted net loss per share by approximately $0.18 for the year ended December 31, 2018.

The following table summarizes the Company’s beginning and ending balances of accounts receivable and deferred revenues:
    
 | Balance at | | Balance at 
 | December 31, | | December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 
(Amounts in thousands) | | | (As Revised)
Assets: | | | | | 
Accounts receivable | $ | 62,223 | | $ | 44,089
Liabilities: | | | | | 
Deferred revenue, current portion | $ | 4,131 | | $ | 1,420 
Deferred revenue, long-term portion | | 40,058 | | | — 
Total deferred revenues | $ | 44,189 | | $ | 1,420 

     
Accounts receivable included trade receivables, as well as receivables from Evercord customers who selected certain prepayment plans for storage services to be delivered over the duration of lifetime or 18 years. Evercord customers have the option to either prepay for storage services in full upfront or finance their prepayment plans over the period of six, 12, or 18 months. Generally, prepayments collected by the Company for the lifetime or 18-year storage plans are non-refundable unless the storage service agreement is terminated. However, Evercord customers who choose the financing option will be obligated to make the remainder of their payments pursuant to the terms of the financing plan, and this represents the Company’s unconditional right to the consideration from its customers. Total receivables pertaining to the financing options was $3.9 million, of which $3.4 million was included in accounts receivable and $0.5 million was related to financing over the period greater than 12 month. As of December 31, 2018, accounts receivable totaled $62.2 million. The Company reclassified $0.5 million to other noncurrent assets in its consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018.


The following table shows the changes in the balance of deferred revenues during the period:
    
 | Deferred 
 | Revenues 
 | (in thousands)
Balance at December 31, 2017 | $ | 1,420 
Increase in deferred revenues | | 43,481
Revenue recognized during the period that was included indeferred revenues at the beginning of the period | | (712) 
Balance at December 31, 2018 | $ | 44,189

 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, revenue recognized that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period totaled $0.7 million, of which $0.6 million was related to genetic testing services and the provision of IVD kits and $0.1 million pertained to undelivered Evercord storage services over the remaining contractual life of such services. 

As of December 31, 2018, total deferred revenues were $44.2 million, which were comprised of the current and long-term portions of $4.1 million and $40.1 million, respectively. The current portion was comprised of $2.1 million relating to the provision of IVD kits, genetic testing services and Evercord storage services that will be fulfilled within the next 12 months, and $2.0 million of unsatisfied performance obligations from the Qiagen Agreement. The long-term portion included $2.9 million of Evercord storage services to be delivered by the Company over the remaining contractual life of such services, and $37.2 million resulting from the remaining performance obligations from the Qiagen Agreement. Such remaining performance obligations were comprised of development services and market development support, for which revenue will be recognized over time based on the value of services; and the option for Qiagen to expand its commercialization to another country, with revenue recognized at a point in time when such option is exercised or expires. The Company expects to recognize $9.2 million of the amounts reported as long-term deferred revenue as each remaining performance obligation is satisfied.

     4.    Fair Value Measurements
     The Company's financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are comprised of investment assets that include money market and investments, and a liability for common stock warrants.  
     The fair value accounting guidance requires that assets and liabilities be carried at fair value and classified in one of the following three categories:
     Level I: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the Company has the ability to access
     Level II: Observable market‑based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data, such as quoted prices, interest rates, and yield curves
     Level III: Inputs that are unobservable data points that are not corroborated by market data.
     This hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. There were no transfers between Level I, Level II and Level III during the periods presented.
     Assets and Liabilities That Are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
     The following table represents the fair value hierarchy for the Company’s financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:
    
 | December 31, 2018 | | December 31, 2017 | 
 | Level I | | Level II | | Level III | Total | | Level I | | Level II | Level III | | Total |

Total financial liabilities | $ | — | | $ | — | $ | — | | $ | — | $ | — | | $ | — | $ | 2,644 | $ | 2,644 

          The Company's warrants to purchase common stock are valued using Level III inputs; the Company used inputs from a Black-Scholes model with market volatility that is determined for comparable companies in the same business sector. The carrying amounts of cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate their fair value and are excluded from the table above. 
     In April 2013, the Company entered into a senior secured term loan with a third-party lender, which consisted of a credit agreement, royalty agreement, warrants and loan commitment. Based upon the Company’s evaluation, the senior secured term loan constituted a liability with embedded derivative features that was accounted for separately as mark-to-market instruments. In addition, adjustments to the embedded royalty feature were recorded as interest expense as they occurred, offset to the carrying amount of the debt (with the eventually cash outlay to settle such amounts recorded against the carrying amount of the debt). Based on the Company’s evaluation, it was determined that the warrants granted are detachable and therefore are a stand-alone component of the senior secured term loan to be fair valued using Level III inputs as a separate derivative. In October 2015, the Company repaid the entire borrowings under the senior secured term loan.

 
  116

 

     The fair value of both the senior secured term loan and warrants was remeasured at the end of each reporting period, with the change in fair value for the term loan recorded as interest benefit from changes in the fair value of long-term debt and the remeasurement gain or loss on the warrants recorded within interest and other income (expense), net in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
     The following table provides a roll forward of the fair value, as determined by Level III inputs, of the warrants for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:
    
 | Warrants | 
 | 2018 | | 2017 | 
 | (in thousands) | 
Beginning balance | $ | 2,644 | | $ | 3,792 
Warrants exercised | | (6,762) | | | — 
Change in fair value | | 4,118 | | | (1,148)
Ending balance | $ | — | | $ | 2,644 

           Warrants
 The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value of warrants are derived from the Company's common stock valuation that is based on inputs from a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Since all of the warrants were exercised on June 26, 2018, the fair value of the warrant liability was remeasured up to that date, with valuation assumptions such as the expected term, risk-free interest rate, and market volatility based on comparable companies in the same business sector determined at the point of the exercise of warrants. The inherent risk in the market volatility is the selection of companies with similar business attributes to the Company. 
 Determining the fair value of warrants requires the application of judgment on the associated valuation assumptions described above. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of warrants represent the Company’s estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties. As a result, if factors change and the Company uses different assumptions, the fair value of warrants could be significantly different in the future.

 5. Financial Instruments
     The Company elected to invest a portion of its cash assets in conservative, income earning, liquid investments. Cash equivalents and investments, all of which are classified as available-for-sale securities, consisted of the following:

      The Company invests in U.S. Treasuries, U.S. agency and high quality municipal bonds which mature at par and are all paying their coupons on schedule. Thus, the Company has determined there is currently no other than temporary impairment of its investments, and will continue to recognize unrealized losses in other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has 16 investments in an unrealized loss position in its portfolio. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the amount of gross realized gains and realized losses upon sales of investments were insignificant, and during the year ended December 31, 2016, sales of investments resulted in gross realized gains of $0.2 million and insignificant gross realized losses. Realized gains and losses are reported in interest and other (expense) income, net in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The following table shows the change in the net unrealized positions of the available-for-sale securities and reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss upon the sale of those securities:

 During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded asset impairment charges totaling $2.1 million in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss, of which $1.9 million was recorded in cost of product revenues and $0.2 million was included in general and administrative expenses, following its impairment analysis on its previous generation of sequencing and automation equipment whose service lives were determined to be significantly shorter than initially expected. These charges also included the write-off of $0.3 million unamortized maintenance service contract prepayments related to the impaired equipment described above. The Company expected to phase out the equipment in the first quarter of 2017 as the Company began its transition to the next generation of sequencing and automation equipment to help streamline its production workflows. 
     Other Assets
     In April 2016, the Company entered into a four-year agreement with an insurance carrier whereby in return for partial exclusivity and the right to pricing benefits the Company paid total consideration of $3.2 million. The total consideration was paid in the third quarter of 2016. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, $1.0 million and $1.8 million in deferred costs were included in other noncurrent assets. The deferred costs are being amortized ratably over the four-year term of the agreement. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, amortization of such costs totaling $0.8 million was recorded for each of the two years as a reduction of product revenues in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
     In August 2017, the Company entered into the 2017 Term Loan agreement with OrbiMed and issued 300,000 shares of its common stock in exchange for OrbiMed’s initial and remaining funding commitments (as described in Note 9). The Company also paid legal fees totaling $0.3 million in connection with this term loan. Total debt issuance costs of $2.7 million is accounted for as a debt discount. For financial statement presentation purposes, the Company has classified $2.0 million of the debt discount as a direct reduction from the outstanding debt balance, while $0.7 million of such remains in other noncurrent assets for the unused borrowing capacity of $50.0 million. The debt discount is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the loan. For the year ended December 31, 2018, amortization of debt discount related to the unused borrowing capacity was $0.1 million. Amortization of debt discount for the unused borrowing capacity was insignificant in the year ended December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, the unamortized portion of the debt discount remained at $0.6 million.
     As of December 31, 2018, other assets also included receivables from Evercord customers who selected the financing option for their prepayment plans (as described in Note 3). Total receivables associated with the financing option over the period greater than 12 months were $0.5 million.

             7. Commitments and Contingencies
     Operating Leases 
     As of December 31, 2018, the Company leases office facilities under non‑cancelable operating lease agreements. The Company currently occupies approximately 136,000 square feet of laboratory and office space at its San Carlos, California corporate headquarters pursuant to a lease that it directly entered into with its landlord in October 2016. This lease covers two office spaces (the “First Space and the “Second Space”). The First Space covers approximately 88,000 square feet at a base rent of $319,095. The Second Space covers approximately 48,000 square feet at a base rent of $190,424 per month. The Company paid a security deposit totaling $0.7 million on this lease.

     Legal Proceedings
     From time to time, the Company is involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions. The Company is aggressively pursuing its current litigation matters, and while there can be no assurances and the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, the Company currently believes that there are no existing claims or proceedings that are likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial position. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation and these actions or other third-party claims against the Company may cause the Company to incur costly litigation and/or substantial settlement charges.
     In addition, the resolution of any intellectual property litigation may require the Company to make royalty payments, which could adversely affect gross margins in future periods. If this were to occur, the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. The actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from the Company's estimates, if any, which could result in the need to record or adjust a liability and record additional expenses. During the periods presented, the Company has not recorded any accrual for loss contingencies associated with such legal proceedings, determined that an unfavorable outcome is probable or reasonably possible, or determined that the amount or range of any possible loss is reasonably estimable, except for the amount accrued in connection with the settlement agreement with the United States Department of Justice described below.
     On March 16, 2018, a lawsuit (the ’831 lawsuit) against the Company was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California by Illumina, Inc., or Illumina, alleging that the Company’s Panorama test infringes certain claims of U.S. Patent No. 9,493,831 (the ‘831 patent). Among other relief, the complaint seeks damages or other monetary relief including costs and pre- and post-judgment interest, treble damages, injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees and costs. On June 29, 2018, the Company filed a petition for inter partes review to challenge the validity of the ‘831 patent with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board of the United States Patent Office, or PTAB, which petition was not instituted. On August 16, 2018, the Company filed a patent infringement action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Illumina, alleging that certain of Illumina’s tests infringe on the Company’s U.S. Patent No. 8,682,592 (the ’592 patent). Among other relief, Natera seeks damages or other monetary relief including costs and pre- and post-judgment interest, treble damages, injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees and costs. On January 16, 2019, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California held a claim construction 

 
  122

 
hearing, and on January 30, 2019, issued an order construing certain claims. The Company intends to vigorously defend against the claims in the ‘831 lawsuit and assert its own claims with respect to the ‘592 patent, but cannot provide any assurance as to the ultimate outcome of either matter or that an adverse resolution of either lawsuit would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. The Company is unable to predict the outcome and is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss, if any, that could result from any unfavorable outcome.
     On each of February 17, 2016, March 10, 2016, March 28, 2016 and April 4, 2016, purported class action lawsuits were filed in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of San Mateo (the “San Mateo Superior Court”), against Natera, its directors, certain of its officers and 5% stockholders and their affiliates, and each of the underwriters of the Company’s July 1, 2015 initial public offering (the “IPO”). The complaints assert claims under Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The complaints allege, among other things, that the Registration Statement and Prospectus for the Company’s IPO contained materially false or misleading statements, and/or omitted material information that was required to be disclosed, about the Company’s business and prospects. Among other relief, the complaints seek class certification, unspecified compensatory damages, rescission, attorneys' fees, and costs. The Company removed these actions to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and the actions were subsequently remanded back to the San Mateo Superior Court. The Company has appealed the remand and discovery has been stayed, or held, pending the appeal. The Company also filed a demurrer, or a request for dismissal as a matter of law, in the San Mateo Superior Court, which was granted on October 23, 2017.  The San Mateo Superior Court demurred the claims under Sections 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, without leave to re-file. The San Mateo Superior Court granted the demurrer as to Section 11 of the Act with leave to re-file.  Plaintiffs refiled an amended complaint on November 22, 2017. The Company filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings under the amended complaint on January 25, 2018, which the plaintiffs opposed. Hearings on the motion were held in May and July of 2018. On August 7, 2018 the judge granted the Company’s motion for judgment on the pleadings, without leave to amend, and ordered that judgment be entered in favor of the defendants. Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on or about October 18, 2018. The Company intends to continue to defend the matter vigorously, but cannot provide any assurance as to the ultimate outcome or that an adverse resolution would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. The Company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome and is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss, if any, that could result from any unfavorable outcome.
     On January 22, 2019, a lawsuit was filed against the Company in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of San Mateo, by a patient alleging various claims relating to a discordant test result. The complaint seeks unspecified damages. The Company intends to continue to defend the matter vigorously, but cannot provide any assurance as to the ultimate outcome or that an adverse resolution would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. The Company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome and is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss, if any, that could result from any unfavorable outcome.
     On December 12, 2015, the Company received a civil investigative demand from the United States Department of Justice in connection with a qui tam action related to past reimbursement submissions for some of its testing. The qui tam action was originally filed under seal by the relators on January 26, 2015 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky. The qui tam complaint alleged that Natera submitted false claims to government health care programs for its testing services performed during the period from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016, and sought damages and penalties. The complaint was unsealed on February 8, 2018. On March 7, 2018, the Company reached agreement with the United States Department of Justice to resolve all claims made against it in the action. Under the settlement agreement, the Company will pay a total of approximately $11.4 million to the federal government and the participating state Medicaids, of which approximately $5.3 million plus applicable interest will be paid in four equal quarterly installments, subject to the Company’s option to prepay without penalty. In exchange for the payment of the settlement amounts, the United States and the relators agreed to release the Company from certain claims, including civil or administrative monetary relief sought under the complaint. The settlement agreement does not contain or represent an admission of liability or wrongdoing by the Company, and there will be no corporate integrity agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a charge of $11.4 million associated with this settlement in its statements of operations and comprehensive loss. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company paid $5.3 million and the required quarterly installments, and the final quarterly installment of $1.4 million remained in its other 

 
  123

 
accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2018. See Note 6 under Other Accrued Liabilities for more detail on payments made.            Director and Officer Indemnifications
     As permitted under Delaware law, and as set forth in the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation and its Bylaws, the Company indemnifies its directors, executive officers, other officers, employees and other agents for certain events or occurrences that may arise while in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under this indemnification is unlimited; however, the Company has insurance policies that may limit its exposure and may enable it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. Assuming the applicability of coverage, the willingness of the insurer to assume coverage, and subject to certain retention, loss limits and other policy provisions, the Company believes any obligations under this indemnification would not be material, other than an initial $1.5 million for securities related claims an $0.3 million for commercial general liability claims. However, no assurances can be given that the covering insurers will not attempt to dispute the validity, applicability, or amount of coverage without expensive litigation against these insurers, in which case the Company may incur substantial liabilities as a result of these indemnification obligations. 
     Third-Party Payer Reimbursement Audits
     From time to time, the Company receives recoupment requests from third-party payers for alleged overpayments. The Company disagrees with the contentions of pending requests and/or has recorded an estimated reserve for the alleged overpayments. The Company is unable to predict the outcome and is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss, if any, that could result from any unfavorable outcome, and/or amounts recorded as an estimated reserve for the alleged overpayments is not material.     Contractual Commitments
     As of December 31, 2018, the Company has non‑cancelable contractual commitments with a supplier for approximately $8.9 million and other material supplier commitments for approximately $5.3 million for inventory material used in the laboratory testing process.        As of December 31, 2018, the Company has a non-cancelable application service agreement with a vendor, in which a license was granted to the Company to utilize the proprietary technology for gene sequencing data analysis. The minimum committed fees remaining under the agreement is $2.1 million, which covers services through March 2020
     As of December 31, 2018, the Company has a non-cancelable contractual commitments with a vendor for biological sample processing and storage totaling approximately $0.5 million for the next 12 months. 
     As of December 31, 2018, the Company has non-cancelable minimum purchase commitments with a supplier of diagnostic reagents totaling approximately $2.0 million through February 2020.

      Stock options vest as determined by the compensation committee. In general, they will vest over a four-year period following the date of grant. Stock options expire at the time determined by the compensation committee but in no event more than ten years after they are granted. These awards generally expire earlier if the participant's service terminates earlier. 
     Restricted Shares and Stock Units. Restricted shares and stock units may be awarded under the 2015 Plan in return for any lawful consideration, and participant who receive restricted shares or stock units generally are not required to pay cash for their awards. In general, these awards will be subject to vesting. Vesting may be based on length of service, the attainment of performance-based milestones or a combination of both, as determined by the compensation committee. 
     2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
     General.    The Company’s 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or 2015 ESPP, was adopted by its board of directors in June 2015 and its stockholders approved it in June 2015. The 2015 ESPP is intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.
     Share Reserve. The Company has reserved 893,548 shares of its common stock for issuance under the 2015 ESPP.

· | 880,000 shares;
--+----------------


· | 1% of the shares of common stock outstanding on the last business day of the prior fiscal year; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the number of shares determined by the Company’s board of directors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

      The number of shares reserved under the 2015 ESPP will automatically be adjusted in the event of a stock split, stock dividend or a reverse stock split (including an adjustment to the per-purchase period share limit).
     Purchase Price. Employees may purchase each share of common stock under the 2015 ESPP at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of the six-month offering periods. An employee’s payroll deductions under the ESPP are limited to 15% of the compensation, and up to a maximum of 5,000 shares may be purchased during any offering period. A participant shall not be granted an option under the ESPP if such option would permit the participant’s rights to purchase stock to accrue at a rate exceeding $25,000 fair market value of stock for each calendar year in which such option is outstanding at any time.
     Offering Periods. Each offering period will last a number of months determined by the compensation committee, not to exceed 27 months.

 Performance-based Awards
    
In June 2017, the Board approved a stock option grant of 425,000 shares to the Company’s chief executive officer, of which 200,000 shares are performance-based options. The vesting of these performance-based options is contingent upon the completion of requisite service for the next three years and the achievement of certain milestones within such period. The milestones are (i) to successfully secure a specified strategic arrangement, at which point 50,000 shares will begin vesting over one year in equal quarterly installments, (ii) to successfully secure a specified licensing arrangement, at which point 75,000 shares will begin vesting over one year in equal quarterly installments, and (iii) to successfully secure specified licensing arrangements related to oncology, at which point 75,000 shares will begin vesting over one year in equal quarterly installments. Each milestone is independent of the other.
    
For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company did not recognize any compensation expense associated with the performance-based options since none of the milestones were achieved or were probable of being achieved.  For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized stock-based compensation cost associated with the performance-based options of $0.4 million after it evaluated that milestone (ii) described above was achieved.
    
In December 2018, the Board approved a performance-based option grant of 600,000 shares to the Company’s executive chairman. The vesting of these performance-based options is contingent upon the achievement of a certain milestone, and provided that the completion of requisite service is through the date of such vesting, at which point the performance-based options will become fully vested and exercisable. The revenue milestone was not achieved or was not probable of being achieved during the year ended December 31, 2018, and the Company did not recognize any compensation expense associated with it.

 Stock‑Based Compensation Expense
     Employee and non‑employee stock‑based compensation expense was calculated based on awards ultimately expected to vest and have been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods, if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
     The following table presents the effect of employee and non‑employee stock‑based compensation expense on selected statements of operations line items for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.
    
 | Year ended December 31, | 
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 
 | Employee | | Non-Employee | | Total | Employee | | Non-Employee | | Total | Employee | | Non-Employee | | Total

          As of December 31, 2018, approximately $24.8 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested option awards and RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures. The unrecognized compensation expense will be recognized over a weighted‑average period of approximately 2.45 years.
     Valuation of Stock Option Grants to Employees
     The Company estimates the fair value of its stock options granted to employees on the grant date using the Black‑Scholes option‑pricing model. The fair value of employee stock options is amortized on a straight‑line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, generally the vesting period. The fair value of employee stock options was estimated using the following assumptions:
 | Year ended December 31,
 | 2018 | | | 2017 | | 2016 | 
Expected term (years) | 5.24 | | — | 5.62 | | 5.14 | | — | 5.24 | | 5.10 | | — | 5.20 | 
Expected volatility | 40.28 | % | — | 42.53 | % | 40.75 | % | — | 62.93 | % | 63.06 | % | — | 72.49 | %
Expected dividend rate | | | | 0 | % | | | | 0 | % | | | | 0 | %
Risk-free interest rate | 2.37 | % | — | 3.06 | % | 1.67 | % | — | 2.16 | % | 0.97 | % | — | 1.92 | %

 Valuation of Stock Option Grants to Non-Employees 
     Total options outstanding as of December 31, 2018 include 131,865 shares of option awards that were granted to non-employees, of which 36,344 shares are unvested. Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options granted to non-employees is recognized as the stock option is earned and the services are rendered. The Company believes that the estimated fair value of the stock options is more readily measurable than the fair value of the services rendered. The fair value of the stock options granted to non-employees is calculated at each reporting date using the Black-Scholes options-pricing model with the following assumptions: 
    
 | Year ended December 31,
 | 2018 | | | 2017 | | 2016 | 
Expected term (years) | 2.72 | | — | 2.76 | | 2.67 | | — | 2.71 | | 2.65 | | — | 3.16 | 
Expected volatility | 41.36 | % | — | 43.84 | % | 41.22 | % | — | 52.18 | % | 50.90 | % | — | 72.61 | %
Expected dividend rate | | | | 0 | % | | | | 0 | % | | | | 0 | %
Risk-free interest rate | 2.36 | % | — | 2.86 | % | 1.42 | % | — | 1.95 | % | 0.68 | % | — | 1.38 | %

      Expected Term:    The expected term of options represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding. The Company determines its expected term by calculating the average of—(1) its employees’ historical stock options exercise behavior, and (2) the weighted-average of the time-to-vesting and the total contractual life of the options. For employee stock options that are not granted "at-the-money," the Company uses the binomial lattice model to calculate the expected term. Regarding non-employee stock options, the Company estimated the expected term by assessing their historical exercise behavior and length of service, and calculated the average of these two components.
     Expected Volatility:    The Company derived the expected volatility from the average historical volatilities of comparable publicly traded companies within its peer group over a period approximately equal to the expected term. 
     Expected Dividend Rate:    The Company has not paid and does not anticipate paying any dividends in the near future. 
     Risk-Free Interest Rate:    The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the expected term.
                 9.   Debt
     Credit Line Agreement
     In September 2015, the Company entered into a credit line with UBS (the “Credit Line”) providing for a $50.0 million revolving line of credit which can be drawn down in increments at any time. The Credit Line bears interest at 30-day LIBOR plus 1.10%, and it is secured by a first priority lien and security interest in the Company’s money market and marketable securities held in its managed investment account with UBS. UBS has the right to demand full or partial payment of the Credit Line Obligations and terminate the Credit Line, in its discretion and without cause, at any time.  
     For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded interest expense of $1.6 million, $1.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively. Interest payments totaling $1.5 million and $0.5 million had been made on the Credit Line during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, remaining accrued interest was $1.2 million, and the total principal amount outstanding including accrued interest was $50.2 million.
     2017 Term Loan
    
In August 2017, the Company entered into the 2017 Term Loan with OrbiMed, which has a maximum borrowing capacity of $100.0 million. On the closing date of August 8, 2017, the Company borrowed $75.0 million, with the remaining $25.0 million available to borrow at the Company’s option at any time through December 31, 2018, subject to standard conditions. The amounts borrowed under 2017 Term Loan will primarily be used for general corporate purposes and to fund and support the Company’s business and operations. Interest is accrued on the outstanding balance of the loan 

 
  129

 
at a rate equal to the sum of (i) 8.75% plus (ii) the higher of 1.00% or LIBOR. The 2017 Term Loan has an eighty-four month term and will mature in August 2024. The Company is required to make interest payments on a quarterly basis, with repayment of the full outstanding balance on the maturity date. The Company’s obligations under the 2017 Term Loan are secured by substantially all of its assets, including its intellectual property, subject to certain customary exceptions. 

On December 31, 2018, the Company amended certain terms in the 2017 Term Loan with OrbiMed. The amendment increased the existing unused borrowing capacity from $25.0 million to $50.0 million and extended the expiration date for the option to draw the additional to March 31, 2019. If such option were exercised by the Company, the interest rate described above would instead decrease to the sum of (i) 8.50% plus (ii) the higher of 1.00% or LIBOR.

The 2017 Term Loan contains customary affirmative and negative covenants including financial information maintenance covenants, indebtedness limitation covenants, minimum net revenues covenants, and investment covenants. It also includes standard events of default such as payment defaults and nonperformance of obligations and covenants described above. Upon an event of default, an additional interest of 3.00% may be applied to the outstanding debt balance until such default is cured, and OrbiMed may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable. As of December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with all of its covenants under the 2017 Term Loan.

The Company is allowed to voluntarily make prepayments on its outstanding debt balance either partially or in full. When prepayments are made, an additional prepayment premium will be applied to the outstanding principal amount at the time. The prepayment premium will gradually reduce from 12.5% to 2.5% over the term of the loan.

On August 14, 2017, the Company paid OrbiMed a fee in consideration of providing the 2017 Term Loan by issuing 300,000 shares of its common stock. The fair value of the fee was $2.4 million, which was determined based on the Company’s stock price of $8.16 on August 8, 2017. Additionally, the Company paid legal fees of $0.3 million in connection with this term loan. Total debt issuance costs incurred amounted to $2.7 million, which is accounted for as a debt discount to be amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the loan. The Company has classified $2.0 million of the debt discount as a direct reduction from the outstanding debt balance of $75.0 million, while the remainder is classified as noncurrent assets (as described in Note 6).

For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, interest expense totaling $8.6 million and $3.2 million was recorded, respectively, which also included the amortization of debt discount. Debt discount amortized as interest expense was $0.4 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In addition, the Company made interest payments totaling $6.1 million and $3.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, interest accrued for the 2017 Term Loan was $2.1 million, which was paid in January 2019. The Company has not made any principal payment as it is not required to repay the outstanding balance until August 2024.

The following table indicates how the Company reported its long-term debt at the end of the period:

 | December 31, | | December 31, | 
 | 2018 | | 2017 | 
(Amounts in thousands) | | | | 
Debt principal balance | $ | 75,000 | | $ | 75,000

Net carrying amount at end of period | $ | 73,357 | | $ | 73,065 

      10. Warrants
     In April 2014, the Company granted warrants to purchase approximately 376,691 warrants to purchase common stock with an exercise price of $2.3229 per common share. The warrants were granted to ROS Acquisition Offshore LP in connection with the Company’s senior secured term loan that has since been repaid and have an expiration date of April 18, 2023. It was determined that the warrants granted are detachable and therefore are a stand-alone component of the senior secured term loan to be fair valued using Level III inputs as a separate derivative.  
    
 
  130

 

 On June 26, 2018, the warrants were fully exercised by ROS using the option of net share settlement. Instead of remitting cash exercise proceeds to purchase the shares, ROS elected to receive a net amount of 332,896 shares. The Company remeasured the fair value of its warrant liability to $6.8 million during this period until June 26, 2018 and reclassified this amount to stockholders’ equity.
     11. Stockholders’ Equity
     As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 50,000,000 authorized shares of its preferred stock, of which no shares were issued and outstanding; and 750,000,000 authorized shares of its common stock, at $0.0001 par value, and there were 62,082,348 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.
     In August 2017, the Company paid OrbiMed a fee in consideration of providing the 2017 Term Loan (as defined in Note 9) by issuing 300,000 shares of its common stock. The fair value of the fee was $2.4 million, which was determined based on the Company’s stock price of $8.16 on August 8, 2017. 
     In June 2018, OrbiMed exercised all of its warrants, which were all converted into common stock. The exercise was a cashless transaction, and there were 332,896 of net shares issued to OrbiMed following the exercise at the fair value of $6.8 million.
     In July 2018, the Company completed an equity offering to sell 4,500,000 shares of its common stock to the public at a price of $20 per share, along with the sale of 675,000 additional shares of its common stock to the underwriters upon their exercise of the option to purchase those shares. Upon the closing of the equity offering, the Company received proceeds of $97.3 million before offering expenses, which totaled approximately $0.5 million.
     12. Income Taxes 
     The Company's effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 differ from the U.S. federal statutory rate as follows:

      During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded total income tax expense of $0.3 million. The Company provides testing to clinics and also licenses its cloud-based software to licensees that are based in a foreign country, which contributed to a foreign income tax expense of $0.2 million. Total income tax expense also included a state income tax expense of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
     During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded total income tax expense of $0.4 million, which included foreign income tax expense of $0.2 million and state income tax expense of $0.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company did not record any income tax expense given its history of losses, with the exception of $0.1 million of foreign withholding tax in 2016.

 Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The components of the net deferred income tax assets are as follows:
    
 | December 31, |

Deferred tax liabilities: | | | | | 
Property and equipment | | (510) | | | (547) 
Net deferred tax assets | $ | — | | $ | — 

      The Company established a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets in 2018 and 2017 due to the uncertainty surrounding realization of these assets. The valuation allowance increased to $122.4 million as of December 31, 2018 from $95.8 million as of December 31, 2017. The valuation allowance increased during 2018 due to current year losses and credits claimed, offset by a reduction due to the adoption of ASC 606. The valuation allowance increased to $95.8 million as of December 31, 2017 from $85.6 million as of December 31, 2016.
     In December 2017, the U.S. Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Act”). As a result, corporate tax rate was reduced to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. ASC 740, Income Taxes, requires entities to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment. Shortly after the enactment of the Tax Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when an entity does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. The Company made provisional adjustments to reduce its deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017, based on the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 34% to 21% and assessed the realizability of its deferred tax assets based on its current understanding of the provisions of the new law. As of December 31, 2018, the Company completed its assessment of the tax rate change and determined no additional adjustments are required. 
     As of December 31, 2018, the Company had federal and state net operating loss (“NOLs”) carryforwards of approximately $394.0 million and $201.4 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2027 and 2028, respectively, if not utilized. 
     The Company also had federal research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $14.1 million, which begin to expire in 2027, and state research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $10.5 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely. Realization of these deferred tax assets would require $488.1 million in taxable income to fully utilize. Realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the loss and credit carryforwards. 
     Federal and California tax laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of NOLs and credit carryforwards in the event of an "ownership change" for tax purpose, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, the Company's ability to utilize these carryforwards may be limited as the result of such ownership change. Such a limitation could result in limitation in the use of the NOLs in future years and possibly a reduction of the NOLs available.

 A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: 
    
 | Year Ended December 31, | 
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 
 | (in thousands) | 
Balance at beginning of year | $ | 5,945 | | $ | 4,293 | $ | 2,405

Additions for tax positions of prior years | | 1 | | | 1 | | 52 
Balance at end of year | $ | 7,362 | | $ | 5,945 | $ | 4,293

      The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 740-10-50, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2009. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits increased $1.4 million, $1.7 million, and $1.9 million, respectively, due to additional research and development credits generated during the year. As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $7.4 million, $5.9 million and $4.3 million, respectively. The reversal of the uncertain tax benefits would not affect the Company's effective tax rate to the extent that it continues to maintain a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.
     The Company is subject to U.S. federal income taxes and to income taxes in various states in the United States. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations, and require significant judgment to apply. The Company is subject to U.S. federal, state and local tax examinations by tax authorities for all prior tax years since incorporation. The Company does not anticipate significant changes to its current uncertain tax positions through December 31, 2019.
     The Company recognizes any interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense.  As of December 31, 2018, there were no accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.
         13. Net Loss per Share
     Basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. 
     In periods when the Company has incurred a net loss, common stock equivalents such as outstanding common stock options, restricted stock units, unvested common shares subject to repurchase and warrants are excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share as they give an anti-dilutive effect.
     For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reversed $1.1 million of remeasurement gain on the change in the fair value of warrants from its net loss and included the incremental shares from the assumed exercise of the warrants in the computation of its weighted-average shares outstanding as they yielded a dilutive effect to the net loss per share in the period. Other potentially dilutive common stock equivalents such as outstanding common stock options, shares to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan, and restricted stock units were excluded as their effect was anti-dilutive and the net loss per share would be reduced.

                  14.    Subsequent Events
     In January 2019, the Company amended the existing agreement with one of its vendors to establish non-cancelable contractual commitments for a minimum number of genetic tests to be processed, as well as the price per test processed. The amended agreement has a remaining term of two years starting January 1, 2019. For the next 12 months, total contractual commitments are $9.7 million. The commitments beyond 12 months will be determined at the end of 2019.
     In February 2019, the Company entered into a License Agreement with BGI Genomics Co., Ltd (“BGI Genomics”) to develop and commercialize NGS-based genetic testing assays for clinical use. According to the agreement, the Company will receive a total of $50.0 million, comprising $35.0 million in upfront technology licensing fees and prepaid royalties, and $15.0 million in future milestone payments. The Company is committed to pay $6.0 million for future test services. The Company will also prepay $4.0 million to another supplier. The License Agreement

has a term of ten years and expires in February 2029. This Agreement is subject to customary closing conditions, including partner government approval.
     In March 2019, the Company paid off the final quarterly installment of $1.4 million imposed by the settlement agreement relating to reimbursement-related claims.  As required by the settlement agreement, a letter of credit was secured with a financial institution until the settlement amount was entirely paid off.  The letter of credit expired on March 1, 2019, and accordingly, the funds totaling $4.2 million (see Note 2 under Restricted Cash) were available to the Company.
