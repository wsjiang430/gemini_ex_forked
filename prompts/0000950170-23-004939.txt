 OVERVIEW
We are a leading supplier and manufacturer of building materials, manufactured components and construction services to professional homebuilders, sub-contractors, remodelers and consumers. The Company operates 569 locations in 42 states across the United States, which are internally organized into geographic operating divisions. Due to the similar economic characteristics, categories of products, distribution methods and customers, our operating divisions are aggregated into one reportable segment.
We offer an integrated solution to our customers by providing manufacturing, supply and installation of a full range of structural and related building products. Our manufactured products include our factory-built roof and floor trusses, wall panels, vinyl windows, custom millwork and trim, as well as engineered wood that we design, cut, and assemble specifically for each home. We also assemble interior and exterior doors into pre-hung units. Additionally, we supply our customers with a broad offering of professional grade building products not manufactured by us, such as dimensional lumber and lumber sheet goods and various window, door and millwork lines. Our full range of construction-related services include professional installation, turn-key framing and shell construction, spanning all of our product categories. Further, through our Paradigm subsidiary, we offer software solutions and services for the building products industry.
Builders FirstSource, Inc. is a Delaware corporation formed in 1998 as BSL Holdings, Inc. On October 13, 1999, our name changed to Builders FirstSource, Inc. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “BLDR”.
OUR INDUSTRY
We operate in the professional segment (“Pro Segment”) of the U.S. residential building products supply market. Customers in the Pro Segment primarily include production and custom homebuilders, remodeling contractors, and multifamily builders. While we are the largest building product supplier according to HBS Dealer magazine’s 2022 Top 200 ProDealers list and the only building supplier with manufacturing capabilities with over $10 billion in sales, the industry remains highly fragmented with competition from large national dealers, specialty dealers, large building supply retailers, regional and local material distributors and smaller privately owned suppliers, truss manufacturers and lumberyards. As such, the industry presents significant opportunities for growth and a number of potential acquisitions.

The residential building products industry is driven by the level of activity in both the U.S. residential new construction market and the U.S. residential repair and remodeling market. Growth within these markets is linked to a number of key factors, including demographic trends, housing demand, interest rates, employment levels, availability of credit, foreclosure rates, consumer confidence, the availability of qualified tradesmen, and the state of the economy in general.
The residential building products industry is characterized by several key trends, including greater utilization of manufactured components, an expanding role of the distributor in providing turn-key services and a consolidation of suppliers by homebuilders, as described in more detail below. Additionally, there is increasing interest in using digital tools to help drive end-to-end efficiencies throughout the construction industry.
•Prefabricated components: Compared to conventional “stick-build” construction where builders cut and assemble lumber at the job site with their own labor, prefabricated components are engineered in an offsite location using specialized equipment and labor. This outsourced task allows for optimal material usage, lower overall labor costs and improved quality of structural elements. In addition, using prefabricated components typically results in faster construction because fabrication can be automated and performed more systematically. As such, we believe there is a long-term trend towards increased use of prefabricated components by homebuilders. 
 •Turn-key services: Many homebuilders have taken a more limited role in the homebuilding process and have outsourced certain key elements of the construction process, including process management, product selection, order input, scheduling, framing and installation. As such, we believe that many homebuilders are increasingly looking to suppliers in the Pro Segment to perform these critical functions, resulting in greater demand for integrated project services.
 •Consolidation of suppliers by homebuilders: We believe that homebuilders are increasingly looking to consolidate their supplier base. Many homebuilders are seeking a more strategic relationship with suppliers that are able to offer a broad range of products and services and, as a result, are allocating a greater share of wallet to a select number of larger, full-service suppliers. 
 According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the single-family residential construction market was an estimated $384.4 billion in 2022, which was 14.7% lower than 2021, and continues to be lower than the historical high of $470.4 billion in 2006. Further, according to the Home Improvement Research Institute (“HIRI”) in its September 2022 semi-annual forecast, the professional repair and remodel end market was an estimated $180.7 billion in 2022, which was 10.2% higher than 2021.
OUR CUSTOMERS
We serve a broad customer base across the United States. We have a diverse geographic footprint, as we have operations in 47 of the top 50 and 86 of the top 100 U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Areas (“MSAs”), as ranked by single family housing permits based on available 2022 U.S. Census data. Given the local nature of our business, we have historically and will continue to locate our facilities in close proximity to our key customers and co-locate multiple operations in one facility to improve efficiency.
We have a diversified customer base, ranging from large production builders to small custom homebuilders, as well as multifamily builders, repair and remodeling contractors and light commercial contractors. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 18% of net sales, with our largest customer accounting for approximately 5% of net sales. Our top 10 customers are comprised primarily of the largest national production homebuilders, including publicly traded companies such as D.R. Horton, Inc., Dream Finders Homes, Inc., Lennar Corporation, Pulte Homes, Inc., Taylor Morrison Home Corporation, and Toll Brothers Inc.
In addition to the largest production homebuilders, we also service and supply regional production and local custom homebuilders as well as repair and remodeling contractors and multifamily builders. These customers require high levels of service and a broad product offering. Our sales team expects to work very closely with the designers on a day-to-day basis in order to ensure the appropriate products are identified, ordered or produced and delivered on time to the building site. To account for these increased service costs, pricing in the industry is tied to the level of service provided and the volumes purchased. Servicing a broad range of homebuilders, including single-family and multifamily builders, and remodeling contractors allows us to more effectively manage market conditions that may have an outsized adverse impact on a specific customer segment.
OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
We group our building products and services into four product categories:
Lumber and Lumber Sheet Goods. Lumber and lumber sheet goods include dimensional lumber, plywood and oriented strand board (“OSB”) products used in on-site house framing. Lumber & lumber sheet goods are our largest sales volume product category. The products in this category are highly sensitive to fluctuations in market prices for such commodities.
Manufactured Products. Manufactured products are factory-built substitutes for job-site framing and include wood floor and roof trusses, steel roof trusses, wall panels, and engineered wood that we design, cut, and assemble for each home. Manufactured products also include our proprietary whole-house framing solution, Ready-Frame®, which designs, pre-cuts, labels, and bundles lumber and lumber sheet goods into customized framing packages, saving builders both time and money and improving job site safety. Our manufactured products allow builders to build higher quality homes more efficiently. Roof trusses, floor trusses, and wall panels are built in a factory-controlled environment. Engineered floors and beams are cut to the required size and packaged for the given application at many of our locations. Without manufactured products, builders construct these items on site, where weather and variable labor quality can negatively impact construction cost, quality and installation time. In addition, engineered wood beams have greater structural strength than conventional framing materials, allowing builders to frame houses with more open space creating a wider variety of house designs. Engineered wood floors and open-web floor trusses are also stronger and straighter than conventionally framed floors. While not as sensitive to commodity price fluctuations as lumber and lumber sheet goods, the products in this category are constructed using lumber and lumber sheet goods, and thus are somewhat sensitive to commodity price fluctuations.
 Windows, Doors and Millwork. Windows and doors are comprised of the manufacturing, assembly and distribution of windows, and the assembly and distribution of interior and exterior door units. We manufacture a portion of the vinyl windows that we distribute in our plant in Houston, Texas which allows us to supply builders, primarily in the Texas market, with cost-competitive products. Our pre-hung interior and exterior doors consist of a door slab with hinges and door jambs attached, reducing on-site installation time and providing higher quality finished door units than those constructed on site. These products typically require a high degree of product knowledge and training to sell. Millwork includes interior trim and custom features, including those that we manufacture under the Synboard ® brand name. Synboard is produced from extruded PVC and offers several advantages over traditional wood features, such as greater durability and no ongoing maintenance, such as periodic caulking and painting.
 Specialty Building Products and Services. Specialty building products and services consist of various products, including vinyl, composite and wood siding, exterior trim, metal studs, cement, roofing, insulation, wallboard, ceilings, cabinets and hardware. This category also includes services such as turn-key framing, shell construction, design assistance and professional installation of products spanning all of our product categories. We provide professional installation and turn-key services as a solution for our homebuilder customers. Through our installation services program, we help homebuilders realize efficiencies through improved scheduling, resulting in reduced cycle time and better cost controls. By utilizing an energy efficiency software program, we also assist homebuilders in designing energy efficient homes in order to meet increasingly stringent energy rating requirements. Upgrading to our premium windows, doors, and insulating products can reduce overall cost to the homebuilder by minimizing costs of the required heating/cooling system. We work closely with the homebuilder to select the appropriate mix of our products to meet current and forthcoming energy codes. We believe these services require scale, capital and sophistication that smaller competitors do not possess. We also offer software products through our Paradigm subsidiary, including drafting, estimating, quoting, and virtual home design services, which provide software solutions to retailers, distributors, manufacturers and homebuilders that help them boost sales, reduce costs, and become more competitive. We believe that the homebuilding and remodeling industries are increasingly adopting digital solutions and that we are well positioned to take advantage of these trends because of our scale and prior investments in digital technologies, including our acquisition of Paradigm.
We compete in a fragmented marketplace. We believe our integrated approach and scale allow us to compete effectively through our comprehensive product lines, prefabricated components and value-added services, combined with the knowledge of our integrated sales forces to enable our homebuilder customers to complete construction more quickly, with higher quality and at a lower cost. While we expect these benefits to be particularly valuable to our customers in market environments characterized by labor shortages and sourcing challenges, we expect such benefits will also be increasingly valued and demanded by our customers operating under normal market conditions.
 MANUFACTURING
Our manufacturing facilities utilize industry leading technology, including automated robotic truss lines, and high-quality materials to improve product quality, increase efficiency, reduce lead times and minimize production errors. We manufacture products within two of our product categories: manufactured products, and windows, doors & millwork.

Manufactured Products — Trusses and Wall Panels. Truss and wall panel production has two steps — design and fabrication. Each house requires its own set of designed shop drawings, which vary by builder type — production versus custom builders. Production builders use prototype house plans as they replicate houses. These house plans may be minimally modified to suit individual customer demand. We maintain an electronic master file of trusses and wall panels for each builder’s prototype houses. For custom builders, the components are designed individually for each house. We download the shop drawings from our design department to computerized saws. We assemble the cut lumber to form roof trusses, floor trusses or wall panels, before shipping the finished components by house to the job site. In addition, we offer our Ready-Frame® framing system which uses specialty software to calculate project-specific lumber needs to provide pre-cut and labeled packages delivered and ready to assemble on the jobsite.
Manufactured Products — Engineered Wood. As with trusses and wall panels, engineered wood components have design and fabrication steps. We design engineered wood floors using a master filing system similar to the truss and wall panel system. Engineered wood beams are designed to ensure the beam will be structurally sound in the given application. After the design phase, a printed layout is generated. We use this layout to cut the engineered wood to the required length and assemble all of the components into a house package. We design and fabricate engineered wood at many of our distribution locations.
Custom Millwork. Our manufactured custom millwork consists primarily of interior and exterior pre-hung door systems, intricate interior and exterior mouldings, custom and premium windows, finish hardware, stair parts, mantels and columns units.
Windows. We manufacture a full line of traditional vinyl windows at an approximately 200,000 square foot manufacturing facility located in Houston, Texas. The process begins by purchasing vinyl lineal extrusions. We cut these extrusions to size and join them together to form the window frame and sash. We then purchase sheet glass and cut it to size. We combine two pieces of identically shaped glass with a sealing compound to create a glass unit with improved insulating capability. We then insert the sealed glass unit and glaze it into the window frame and sash. The unit is completed when we install a balance to operate the window and add a lock to secure the window in a closed position.
Pre-hung Doors. We manufacture pre-hung interior and exterior doors at many of our locations. We insert door slabs and pre-cut door jambs into a door machine, which bores holes into the doors for the door hardware and applies the jambs and hinges to the door slab. We then apply the casing that frames interior doors at a separate station. Exterior doors do not have a casing, and instead may have sidelights applied to the sides of the door, a transom attached over the top of the door unit and a door sill applied to the threshold.
OUR STRATEGY
By pursuing the Company’s four pillar strategic priorities as outlined below, we intend to build on our advantaged market position to create value for our shareholders by increasing profits and net cash flow generation, while making us a more valuable partner to our customers. The resulting cash flow should provide meaningful opportunities for increased investment in organic and acquisitive growth that preserve our balance sheet strength, grow our return on invested capital and return capital to our shareholders.
Organic Growth of Value-add Products and Services
 Maximize our share of wallet by capturing above-market growth in our higher margin value-added products. We believe our national manufacturing footprint and differentiated capabilities will allow us to capture growth in our higher margin value-added products, including trusses, wall panels and millwork. We believe our value-added products address the growing demand for ways to build homes more efficiently, addressing labor constraints and rising costs. We plan to accelerate this growth by further expanding our national manufacturing footprint to serve locations that do not currently have adequate access to these higher margin products. By focusing on our differentiated platform and broad product mix, we are able to offer a complete array of products and services that would otherwise need to be sourced from various distributors, providing us an opportunity to capture a greater share of wallet. This operational platform often will make us a preferred distributor for large-scale national homebuilders as well as local and custom homebuilders looking for more efficient ways to build a home. We have also made significant investments in digital solutions that we believe position us to take advantage of long-term digitization trends in the homebuilding and remodel industries. We believe that customers continue to place an increased value on these capabilities, which further differentiates us from our competitors.
 Leverage our competitive strengths to capitalize on housing market share. We intend to leverage our core business strengths including local market presence, national footprint, unmatched scale in manufacturing capability, breadth of product portfolio, and end market exposure to expand our sales and profit margins. Our customers continue to emphasize the importance of local access, competitive pricing, a broad product portfolio, sales force knowledge, labor-saving manufactured products, on-site services and overall “ease of use” with their building products suppliers. Our comprehensive product offering, experienced sales force, strong strategic vendor relationships, location coverage in important markets, and tenured senior management team position us well to capitalize on strong demand in the new home construction market and the repair and remodel segment. Our large delivery fleet,

professional drivers, well positioned locations, and comprehensive inventory management enable us to provide “just-in-time” product delivery, ensuring a smoother and faster production cycle for the homebuilder. Our comprehensive network of products, services and facilities provides a strategically advantaged service model which enhances our value to our customers and provides a strong platform to drive growth. We have also expanded our operational footprint in the multifamily and light commercial markets to position us for further growth in these growing end-markets.
Drive Operational Excellence
 Optimize our highly scalable cost structure with operational excellence initiatives. We continue to focus on standardizing and automating processes and technology-based workflows to minimize costs, streamline our operations and enhance working capital efficiency. We are implementing operational excellence initiatives that are designed to further improve efficiency, as well as customer service. These initiatives, including distribution and logistics, pricing and margin management, back-office efficiencies, customer integration and systems-enabled process improvements, should yield significant cost savings. The scope and scale of our existing infrastructure, customer base, and logistical capabilities mean that improvements in efficiency, when replicated across our network, can yield substantial profit margin expansion.
 Continue to Build our High-Performing Culture
 Strong emphasis on putting our people first. Our team members are a critical resource, and every single one makes a difference. Enhancing talent acquisition, employee development and retention will ensure we continue to attract and retain this valuable component of our business. Our team members are the face of the Company to our customers and the communities in which we operate. Their contributions in serving our customers are a fundamental component in our success. We care about our team members and strive to have a strong environmental, health and safety program that drives world-class safety results and ensures our team members leave their workplace safely, every day. We have developed programs to help progress our people’s careers, such as our Pilot Leadership Development Program, and we strive to maintain a performance-based culture.
Environmental, social and governance strategy. We are also committed to making informed choices that improve our corporate governance, financial strength, operational efficiency, environmental stewardship, community engagement and resource management. Consistent with our core values, our goal is to be recognized by our customers as the preferred supplier, by our employees as a safe, diverse and inclusive workforce, by the industry as being at the forefront of innovation, by our stakeholders as an ethical company and by the communities in which we serve as a good corporate citizen. We recognize that the environmental sustainability of our products is important to both us as a company and to our customers. We prioritize purchasing and supplying sustainable wood products led by the Sustainable Forestry Initiative. Helping homebuilders become more productive, more efficient, and safer is fundamental to what we do and we are passionate about building this future together.
 Pursue Strategic Acquisitions
Leverage free cash flow to accelerate strategic growth. The highly fragmented nature of the Pro Segment of the U.S. residential new construction building products supply market presents substantial acquisition opportunities. Our long-term acquisition strategy is focused on the continued growth of our prefabricated components business and on the potential for geographic expansion. First, we plan to selectively seek acquisition targets that manufacture prefabricated components such as factory-built roof and floor trusses, wall panels, and engineered wood, as well as other value-added products such as vinyl windows and millwork. We also intend to pursue potential acquisitions that present an opportunity to add manufacturing capabilities in a relatively short period of time. Second, there remain a number of attractive homebuilding markets where we do not currently operate. We believe that our proven operating model can be successfully adapted to these markets and where homebuilders, many of whom we currently serve elsewhere, would value our broad product and service offering, professional expertise, and superior customer service. When entering a new market, our strategy is to acquire market-leading distributors and subsequently expand their product offerings or add manufacturing facilities while integrating their operations into our centralized platform. This strategy allows us to quickly achieve the scale required to maximize profitability and leverage existing customer relationships in the local market. Our management has shown the capability to effectively and efficiently integrate newly acquired businesses, increase productivity and drive value. We have successfully integrated approximately 60 acquisitions since 1998, including the BMC and ProBuild transactions both of which were company and industry transforming.
 SALES AND MARKETING
We seek to attract and retain customers through exceptional customer service, leading product quality, broad product and service offerings, and competitive pricing. This strategy is centered on building and maintaining strong customer relationships rather than traditional marketing and advertising. We strive to add value for the homebuilders through shorter lead times, lower total project costs, faster project completion and higher quality. We believe by executing this strategy we will continue to generate new business.

Our experienced, locally focused sales force is at the core of our sales effort. This sales effort involves deploying salespeople who are skilled in housing construction to meet with a homebuilder’s construction superintendent, local purchasing agent, or local executive with the goal of becoming their primary product supplier. If selected by the homebuilder, the salesperson and his or her team review blueprints for the contracted homes and advise the homebuilder in areas such as opportunities for cost reduction, increased energy efficiencies, and regional aesthetic preferences. Next, the team determines the specific package of products that are needed to complete the project and schedules a sequence of site deliveries. Our large delivery fleet and comprehensive inventory management systems enable us to provide “just-in-time” product delivery, ensuring a smoother and faster production cycle for the homebuilder. Throughout the construction process, the salesperson makes frequent site visits to ensure timely delivery and proper installation, and to make suggestions for efficiency improvements. We believe this level of service is highly valued by our customers and generates significant customer loyalty. At December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 2,400 sales representatives, who are generally paid a commission based on gross margin dollars collected and worked with approximately 2,600 sales coordinators and product specialists.
MATERIALS AND SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS
We purchase inventory primarily for distribution, some of which is also utilized in our manufacturing plants. The key materials we purchase include dimensional lumber, OSB and plywood, engineered wood, windows, doors, millwork, and roofing. Our largest suppliers are national companies such as Boise Cascade Company, Weyerhaeuser Company, West Fraser Timber Co. Ltd., Specialty Building Products, James Hardie Industries plc, and Louisiana-Pacific Corp. We believe marketplace supply allows us to competitively source most of our requirements without reliance on any particular supplier and that our diversity of suppliers affords us purchasing flexibility. Due to our centralized procurement platform for commodity wood products and corporate oversight of purchasing programs, we believe we are able to maximize the advantages of both our and our suppliers’ broad geographic footprints and negotiate purchases across multiple markets to achieve more favorable contracts with respect to price, terms of sale, and supply. Additionally, for certain customers, we institute purchasing programs on commodity wood products such as OSB and lumber to align portions of our procurement costs with our customer pricing commitments. We balance our OSB and lumber purchases with a mix of contract and spot market purchases to ensure consistent supply of product necessary to fulfill customer contracts, to source products at the lowest possible cost, and to minimize our exposure to the volatility of commodity lumber prices.
 We currently source products from thousands of suppliers in order to reduce our dependence on any single company and to maximize purchasing leverage. Although no purchases from any single supplier represented more than approximately 8% of our total materials purchases for the year ended December 31, 2022, we believe we are one of the largest customers for many suppliers, and therefore have significant purchasing leverage. We have found that using multiple suppliers ensures a stable source of products and the best purchasing terms as the suppliers compete to gain and maintain our business.
We maintain strong relationships with our suppliers, and we believe opportunities exist to improve purchasing terms in the future, including inventory storage or “just-in-time” delivery to reduce our inventory carrying costs. We will continue to pursue additional procurement cost savings which would further enhance our margins and cash flow.
COMPETITION
We have and will continue to experience robust competition for homebuilder business due to the highly fragmented nature of the Pro Segment. We face competition from other large national dealers that focus on the Pro Segment, including U.S. LBM, 84 Lumber and Carter Lumber; specialty dealers, such as roofing building supply companies; regional and local building supplies dealers; single and multi-site lumber yards; framing contractors; component manufacturers including Universal Forest Products and Stark Truss; and millwork operators such as American Cedar & Millwork and Westpac. We believe that we have competitive advantages over our competitors due to our long-standing customer relationships, local market knowledge, competitive pricing, superior service, broad product offering and large-scale procurement capabilities. We cultivate long-term relationships with professional builders and work to retain our customers by delivering a full range of high-quality products on time, and offering trade credit, competitive pricing and integrated service and product packages, such as turn-key framing and shell construction, as well as manufactured components and installation. We believe that our local market knowledge, strong customer relationships, superior service, and operational efficiencies allow us to cost-effectively supply our customers, which both enhances profitability and reduces the risk of losing customers to competitors.
HUMAN CAPITAL
At December 31, 2022, we had approximately 29,000 employees. Less than 1% are covered by collective bargaining agreements, where we believe our relations with the labor unions are generally good. Employee levels are managed to align with the pace of business and management believes it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully.
Our people are the key to our success and our continued focus on delivering exceptional customer service and innovative solutions. In managing our human capital, our goal is to ensure their safety, growth and development in an inclusive and team-based environment. By participating in regular surveys and focus groups, we place a strong emphasis on enhancing and increasing the retention and engagement level of our team members. Key areas of the Company’s human capital focus include the following:
Workplace Health & Safety
 We care about our team members and anyone who enters our workplace. We strive to have a strong environmental, health and safety program that focuses on implementing policies and training programs. We also perform self-audits to ensure our team members leave their workplace safely, every day. Over the past several years, we have developed and implemented programs designed to promote workplace safety, with the goal of reducing the frequency and severity of employee injuries. We review and monitor our performance closely by updating our executive team monthly on progress.
 During 2022, our experience and continuing focus on workplace safety enabled us to preserve business continuity without sacrificing our commitment to keeping our team members and workplace visitors safe.
 The Company also aspires to reduce its lost time and recordable injuries each year. In 2022, we reduced our Total Recordable Incident Rate for the seventh consecutive year and by approximately 22% over the prior year.
 We also broadly provide accessible safety training to our employees in a number of formats to accommodate the learner’s style, pace, location, and access to technology.
Diversity & Inclusion
 Our team members are the face of the Company to our customers and the communities in which we operate. Their contributions in serving our customers are a fundamental component in our success, and every single team member makes a difference.
 Our Company strives to foster a culture that encourages collaboration, flexibility and fairness to enable all team members to contribute to their full potential. We are committed to enhancing our efforts related to diversity and inclusion across all aspects of our organization, including hiring, promotion and developmental opportunities. We conduct both in-person and online diversity training through our online learning management system. We continue to create greater awareness, eliminate unconscious bias and foster more open and honest communication through our Corporate Inclusion Council.
 To assess and improve our efforts, the Company recently surveyed employees finding that the majority of employees feel welcome, safe and included, treated fairly with opportunities to reach full potential, supported professionally, emotionally and socially and are comfortable sharing experiences and opinions, and valued as a team member. We identified four key priorities through our survey: enhance awareness, increase diversity of the workforce, improve and enhance communication, and increase inclusion and engagement. With these priorities in mind we have launched diversity and inclusion trainings, introduced quarterly town halls and engaged in regular Company-wide communications, introduced leadership development and sales trainings, and are in the process of establishing regional and local employee resource groups.
Learning & Development
 In order to attract and retain top talent, we provide several resources in a variety of formats that promote the ongoing learning and development of our team members. We offer leadership development training for new and existing leaders in topics such as: Effective Communication, Conducting Performance Management, Developing Successful and Productive Teams, Conflict Resolution & Management, Providing Exceptional Customer Service, Hiring for Fit and Building a Diverse and Inclusive Team. We have maintained our commitment to learning and development through our online learning management system and limited on-site courses facilitated in a safe setting by our training and development team. Our online course catalog offers approximately 11,000 courses which are available to all team members.
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS
Our operations are dependent upon our information technology systems, which encompass all of our major business functions. Our primary enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) systems, which we currently use for operations representing the majority of our sales, are proprietary systems that have been highly customized by our computer programmers. The materials required for thousands of standard builder plans are stored by the system for rapid quoting or order entry. Hundreds of price lists are maintained on hundreds of thousands of SKUs, facilitating rapid price changes in a changing product cost environment. A customer’s order can be tracked at each stage of the process and billing can be customized to reduce a customer’s administrative costs and payment speed.
We have a customized financial reporting system that consolidates financial, sales and workforce data from our ERP systems and our human resource information system (“HRIS”), delivering standardized enterprise key performance indicators. This technology platform provides management with robust corporate and location level performance management by leveraging standardized metrics and analytics allowing us to plan, track and report performance and compensation measures.
We have developed a proprietary program for use in our component plants. This software reviews product designs for errors, schedules the plants and provides the data used to measure plant efficiency. In addition, we have purchased several software products that have been integrated with our primary ERP system. These programs assist in various aspects of our business such as analyzing blueprints to generating material lists, purchasing lumber products at the lowest cost, delivery management, resource planning and scheduling and financial planning and analysis.
 In 2022, we announced the decision to move the Company to a new ERP system. The program will begin in 2023 kicking off with detailed planning, design, build and testing followed by several years of deployment across our broad network of operating sites. As part of this program, we intend to utilize technology-enabled opportunities to enhance our operating model and transform our business creating further value for all our stakeholders.
 SEASONALITY AND OTHER FACTORS
Our first and fourth quarters have historically been, and are generally expected to continue to be, adversely affected by weather causing reduced construction activity during these quarters. In addition, quarterly results historically have reflected, and are expected to continue to reflect, fluctuations from period to period arising from the following:
•The volatility of lumber prices; 
 •The cyclical nature of the homebuilding industry; 
 •General economic conditions in the markets in which we compete; 
 •The pricing policies of our competitors; 
 •Disruptions in our supply chain;
 •The production schedules of our customers; and 
 •The effects of weather. 
 The composition and level of working capital typically change during periods of increasing sales as we carry more inventory and receivables. Working capital levels typically increase in the first and second quarters of the year due to higher sales during the peak residential construction season. These increases may result in negative operating cash flows during this peak season, which historically have been financed through available cash and borrowing availability under credit facilities. Generally, collection of receivables and reduction in inventory levels following the peak building and construction season positively impact cash flow.
