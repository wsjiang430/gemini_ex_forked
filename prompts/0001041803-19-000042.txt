 ﻿
 Our Company
 ﻿
 PriceSmart began operations in 1996 in San Diego, California. We own and operate U.S. style membership shopping warehouse clubs in Central America, the Caribbean and Colombia.  These regions have a population of approximately 109 million people and a combined gross domestic product of approximately $1.4 trillion. We also function as a wholesale supplier to a retailer in the Philippines.  We sell high quality brand name and private label consumer products at low prices to individuals and businesses.  Historically, our typical no-frills standard warehouse buildings have ranged in sales floor size from approximately 40,000 to 60,000 square feet and are located primarily in and around the major cities in our markets to take advantage of dense populations and relatively higher levels of disposable income.  However, during fiscal year 2019, we opened two new smaller sales floor warehouse clubs, one in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and the other in Santiago de Veraguas, Panama. We design our smaller format clubs to serve markets whose population is likely to support a smaller club or that are in locations, such as urban areas, where it is challenging to secure sufficient real estate at a reasonable cost for a larger club.  We believe the smaller format can expand our geographic reach in existing markets and provide more convenience for our members. These smaller warehouse club formats have sales floor square footage ranging from 30,000 to 40,000 square feet. 
 ﻿
 As warehouse club operators, we believe that our business success depends on our ability to be the lowest cost operators in our markets and, in turn, to offer the lowest prices on high quality products and services in our markets.  We believe that lower prices on products and services drive sales volume, which increases the Company’s buying leverage, which in turn leads to better pricing that we can then offer to our members, validating the membership investment that our customers make.  In fiscal year 2019, our average net merchandise sales were approximately $1,400 per square foot of sales floor space.
 ﻿
 Our warehouse clubs operate in emerging markets that historically have had higher growth rates and lower warehouse club market penetration than the U.S. market. In the countries in which we operate, we do not currently face direct competition from U.S. membership warehouse club operators. However, we do face competition from various retail formats such as hypermarkets, supermarkets, cash and carry, home improvement centers, electronic retailers, specialty stores, convenience stores, traditional wholesale distribution and growing online sales.

  ﻿
 We are investing in digital transformation, including omni-channel capabilities that enable e-commerce, by integrating technology, talent, supply chain, and operations to enhance the membership shopping experience, drive efficiencies and fuel sales growth.  
 We also operate a legacy (casillero and marketplace) Aeropost business in 38 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, many of which overlap with markets where we operate our warehouse clubs.
 ﻿
 Competitive Strengths
 ﻿
 Low Operating Costs. Our format is designed to move merchandise from our suppliers to our members at a lower expense ratio than our competitors. We strive to achieve efficiencies in product distribution, minimizing the labor required to stock and display merchandise, limiting non-payroll operating expenses and maintaining low occupancy costs. For example, we offer a limited number of stock keeping units (SKUs) with large pack sizes, which allows us to keep shelves stocked with less labor cost than competitors that offer a greater number of SKUs. More recently, we also have opened distribution centers in certain of our high volume markets to improve efficiency and in-stock rates and reduce lead times on high volume products. Our focus on driving down operating costs allows us to offer better value and lower prices to our members, which we believe helps generate member loyalty and renewals, which in turn leads to increased sales.  
 ﻿
 Worldwide Sourcing.  Approximately 52.0% of our sales come from merchandise sourced in the U.S., Asia and Europe.  One of the primary advantages we have compared to most of our competitors is our United States-based buying team that sources merchandise from suppliers in the U.S. and around the world.  Our U.S.-based buyers identify and purchase new and exciting products, including our own Member’s Selection private label products.  Many of these products are available only at PriceSmart in the markets in which we operate.

      Membership. Membership has been a basic operating characteristic in the warehouse club industry beginning over 43 years ago at Price Club, the first warehouse club. Membership fees are an additional component that enables us to operate our business on lower margins than conventional retail and wholesalers and represent approximately 1.7% of net merchandise sales.  In addition, membership allows us to connect more closely with our members and to promote customer loyalty.
 ﻿
 Our membership represents a desirable demographic concentration with strong purchasing power in our markets. During 2019, we continued our expansion of our Platinum Membership rewards program into additional countries in our Central America and Caribbean segments. Similarly, we continue to expand our product and service offerings to members, including discounted travel through our PriceSmart Travel website, co-branded credit card benefits, optical departments and white goods direct delivery programs. We believe that untapped opportunities exist to further enhance the value of our membership in various areas.  We continue to explore opportunities to provide our members with products and services that are particularly attractive to our unique membership base. 
 ﻿
 Business Members. Our product selection, marketing and general business focus are directed to both business and retail consumers. Our business members include a broad cross section of businesses such as restaurants, institutions including schools, and other businesses that purchase products for resale or use in their businesses. These business members represent a significant source of sales and profit and provide purchasing volume that gives us better prices from our suppliers.
 ﻿
 Innovation. The warehouse club industry has been operating for over forty years, following the founding of Price Club in 1976. The world of merchandising has changed greatly over this period, particularly related to technology, the worldwide sourcing of products, a growing middle class in developing and emerging countries and ever changing consumer preferences. We have developed know-how to operate effectively in multiple markets, many of which are relatively small, with different legal requirements, local buying opportunities, cultural norms, unique distribution and logistical challenges and member preferences that require our unique ability to source the correct mix of local versus imported merchandise. We believe that fundamental to our future success is our capacity to continue to adapt and innovate to meet the needs of our current and future members. While not yet as prevalent as in the U.S., online sales penetration is increasing in the markets where we operate. In fiscal year 2019, we instituted the Digital Transformation Committee. This committee is a standing committee reporting to our Board of Directors.  The Digital Transformation Committee is charged with oversight of the Company’s omni-channel development and digital transformation to enhance membership and shareholder value.    ﻿
 Experienced Management Team. In January 2019, Sherry Bahrambeygui was named PriceSmart’s Chief Executive Officer after having been an instrumental component of the evolution of the Company’s governance and other strategic initiatives for over 16 years, including as a member of the Board of Directors for the past eight years. In addition, the other members of our management team have extensive career experience in the warehouse club business.  Many of our executives learned the warehouse club business at Price Club or Sam’s Club (a division of Walmart).  The executive team acquired through Aeropost is experienced in developing online technology and marketing for e-commerce and logistics in the Latin America marketplace.
 ﻿
 Growth Strategy
 ﻿
 Our Board of Directors has approved a growth strategy that includes the following elements:
 ﻿
 Increasing same “store” sales.  We are committed to increasing same store sales by increasing the number of member transactions and by increasing the average order size.  We believe that there are a number of ways to increase same store sales.  In some of our highest volume locations, we have enlarged our buildings to expand sales floors, remodeled aging stores, and added more parking. These projects have taken place at properties in Panama City, Panama; San Pedro Sula, Honduras; Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic; and Kingston, Jamaica.  We are planning to invest in a number of our locations in fiscal year 2020 to improve the shopping experience for our members that we believe will drive sales. Additionally, we plan to continue our development and expansion of our omni-channel member experience such as a comprehensive digital catalog of merchandise available to be ordered online and made available for pickup, direct delivery to home from one of our regional distribution centers or vendors, and enhanced analytics to help us better understand our members and improve the PriceSmart experience.  Another way to increase same store sales is to operate more efficiently and improve the tracking and flow of merchandise to our locations in order to reduce out of stocks.  We believe that the use of technologies to identify member shopping patterns will help us to design targeted marketing campaigns, which will further drive sales. Additionally, we believe that continuing to enhance the member value proposition by modifying our offering to include more prepared foods, offering new services, such as optical and discounts on external services like travel and insurance, helps to drive member loyalty and overall sales.  
 ﻿
 Adding New Warehouse Clubs in Existing Markets. We currently operate in 13 countries/territories, with the largest in terms of population and gross domestic product being Colombia. We currently have announced two additional clubs to open in Colombia in the fall of 2020. We also plan to open four additional warehouse clubs in our other markets. We plan to continue adding more clubs in our existing standard warehouse club format and in our new small warehouse club format where we believe the markets can support additional clubs. 
 ﻿

      New Markets. While we continue to focus on opportunities to expand in Colombia, a market where our membership concept has proven to be well-received and holds significant potential to grow our business, we continue to evaluate potential opportunities for future expansion into new markets in South America.
 ﻿
 Omni-channel Shopping and Other Services.  We are currently focusing our investment in digital transformation and omni-channel capabilities on the following strategic opportunities:
 ﻿
 1. Convenience: Consumers increasingly are requesting home delivery or store pick up for larger items, as well as for their everyday basic shopping needs, such as consumable merchandise.  We are developing solutions, through technology, operational changes and third-party collaborations, to enable our members to order online and have products delivered to their homes or made available for pick up at our clubs.
 ﻿
 2. Smaller Club Format:  Supplementing warehouse club sales with online shopping opportunities is essential to the success of our urban and secondary city club formats.  These smaller clubs may have a reduced selection of non-food products, but we plan to enable members to order online any product typically available at our larger format clubs.
 ﻿
 3. Direct to Consumers: We are in the process of staging certain large ticket products directly in our distribution centers or with our vendors, initially in a few markets, so that members can order these products online and have them shipped directly to their home or business or picked up at one of our clubs.  We are also exploring the opportunity to add products to our in-country selection and fulfilling online orders directly from our distribution centers or vendors.
 ﻿
 4. Cross-border shopping:   Using the sourcing expertise and buying power of PriceSmart, we have begun to extend the range of products that our members can purchase online.  For now, these new products are being sourced in the U.S., fulfilled through our Aeropost distribution center in Miami or forward deployed to regional or domestic distribution centers and shipped to our members.  Members are able to receive orders at their homes or businesses, at designated pick-up areas within our clubs or at Aeropost locations in countries where we operate clubs.
 ﻿
 5. Additional expansion opportunities: We have begun to test combining PriceSmart’s purchasing power with Aeropost’s wider geographic presence and online capabilities to sell merchandise in markets where PriceSmart does not currently have a presence.    ﻿
 Distribution Efficiency.  Since our inception, we have consistently believed that distribution efficiency is fundamental for success in selling merchandise in our traditional clubs, and in today’s world, this principle holds true for purchases made online.  Because PriceSmart sources merchandise from all over the world and especially in the United States, and because we are doing business in countries where infrastructure—roads and ports—is not as modern as in the United States, distribution efficiency is even more significant for us.  Our ability to move products efficiently and in a timely manner from the suppliers to our members is key to the cost structure of our business and, consequentially, to how low we price our products.
 ﻿
 Historically, our international suppliers and especially our U.S. suppliers have generally shipped their products to our Miami distribution facility where they are received and assigned to various containers for direct shipment to our locations.  Regional and in-country suppliers have shipped directly to our locations.  As our location sales volumes have grown, we have begun to route more of our products from both international, regional and local suppliers to major regional distribution centers in order to improve in-stocks, reduce inventory weeks of supply and reduce expense inefficiencies, all with the goal of giving better prices to our members.
 ﻿
 In 2018, we opened our first regional distribution center, which is located in Costa Rica within the metropolitan area of San Jose. This 165,000 square foot building is designed to receive, store and ship dry, refrigerated and frozen products to clubs in Central America. This regional distribution center has the capacity to ship products such as major appliances and online products directly to our members or to convenient pick-up locations, including our clubs.  We are considering other strategic locations for distribution centers to drive efficiencies and expand omni-channel offerings.
 ﻿
 Our Membership Policy
 ﻿
 We offer three types of memberships: Business, Diamond and Platinum. Only businesses can qualify for a Business membership. We promote Business membership through our marketing programs by offering certain merchandise targeted primarily to businesses such as restaurants, hotels, convenience stores, offices and institutions. Business members pay an annual membership fee of approximately $30 for a primary and secondary membership card and approximately $10 for additional add-on membership cards. 
 ﻿
 The Diamond membership is targeted at individuals and families. The annual fee for a Diamond membership in most markets is approximately $35 (entitling members to two cards). In Colombia, the Diamond membership fee has been 90,000 (COP) (including VAT) since April 2019, providing a converted membership price of approximately $26.

      ﻿
 The Company currently offers the Platinum membership program in nine of its thirteen markets. The annual fee for a Platinum membership in most markets is approximately $75. The Platinum membership provides members with a 2% rebate on most items, up to an annual maximum of $500.  Platinum members can apply this rebate to future purchases at the warehouse club at the end of the annual membership period.  The rebate is issued annually to Platinum members on March 1 and expires August 31.  Any rebate amount not redeemed by August 31 is recognized as breakage revenue.  We expect to continue expanding Platinum membership to additional PriceSmart markets.    ﻿
 We recognize membership income over the 12-month term of the membership.  Deferred membership income is presented separately on the consolidated balance sheet and totaled $24.9 million and $23.0 million as of August 31, 2019 and August 31, 2018, respectively.  Our membership agreements provide that our members may cancel their membership and may receive a refund of the prorated share of their remaining membership fee if they so request.  
 ﻿
 Our Intellectual Property Rights
 ﻿
 It is our policy to obtain appropriate proprietary rights protection for trademarks by filing applications for registration of eligible trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in certain foreign countries. We rely on copyright and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights. We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with our employees, consultants and suppliers and other similar measures. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in protecting our proprietary rights. While management believes that our trademarks, copyrights and other proprietary know-how have significant value, changing technology and the competitive marketplace make our future success dependent principally upon our employees’ technical competence and creative skills for continuing innovation.
 ﻿
 Our Competition
 ﻿
 Our international merchandising business competes with a wide range of international, regional, national and local retailers, and traditional wholesale distributors.  We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours and the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer.  Some of our competitors may have greater resources, buying power and name recognition.  In the countries in which we operate, we do not currently face direct competition from U.S. membership warehouse club operators.  However, we do face competition from various retail formats such as hypermarkets, supermarkets, convenience stores, cash and carry, home improvement centers, electronic retailers and specialty stores, including those within Latin America that are owned and operated by large U.S. and international retailers, including Walmart, Inc. in Central America and Grupo Éxito and Cencosud in Colombia.  We have competed effectively in our markets in the past and expect to continue to do so in the future due to the unique nature of the membership warehouse club format.  We have noted that certain retailers within our markets are making investments in upgrading their locations and/or experimenting with different formats.  These actions may result in increased competition within our markets.  Further, it is possible that additional U.S. warehouse club operators may decide to enter our markets and compete more directly with us in a similar warehouse club format. We also face competition from online retailers and last-mile delivery services that serve our markets, and we expect that this type of competition will grow and intensify in the future.
 ﻿
 Our Employees
 ﻿
 As of August 31, 2019, we had approximately 9,000 employees. Approximately 93% of our employees were employed outside of the United States, and unions represent approximately 1,800 employees. Our policy is to provide employees with good wages relative to the competition in the markets in which they work and to provide a safe working environment and good benefits which often exceed the legal requirements for countries in which we do business.  We believe that investing in our employees, treating them as partners in our business and providing opportunities for career advancement lead to long-serving, loyal employees, which in turn creates efficiencies in operations and results in better service to our members. We consider our employee relations to be very good.
 ﻿
 Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations
 ﻿
 Historically, our merchandising businesses have experienced holiday retail seasonality in their markets.  In addition to seasonal fluctuations, our operating results fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as a result of economic and political events in markets that we serve, the timing of holidays, weather, the timing of shipments, product mix and currency effects on the cost of U.S.-sourced products which may make these products more or less expensive in local currencies and therefore more or less affordable.  Because of such fluctuations, the results of operations of any quarter are not indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter.  In addition, there can be no assurance that our future results will be consistent with past results or the projections of securities analysts.
