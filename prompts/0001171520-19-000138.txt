Item 1. Business
Overview
 We are a full service, vertically integrated, self-administered and self-managed REIT focused on the acquisition, ownership and management of single- and multi-tenant Class B industrial properties, including distribution centers, warehouses and light industrial properties, primarily located in secondary and select primary markets across the United States. As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s Portfolio consists of 55 industrial properties located in ten states with an aggregate of approximately 12 million rentable square feet. The Company Portfolio was 95% leased to 182 different tenants across 29 industry types as of December 31, 2018.
 We intend to continue to focus on the acquisition of Class B industrial properties primarily in secondary markets with net rentable square footage ranging between approximately 100 million and 300 million square feet, which we refer to as our target markets. We believe industrial properties in such target markets will provide superior and consistent cash flow returns at generally lower acquisition costs relative to industrial properties in primary markets. Further, we believe there is a greater potential for higher rates of appreciation in the value of industrial properties in our target markets relative to industrial properties in primary markets.
 We believe our target markets provide us with opportunities to acquire both stabilized properties generating favorable cash flows, as well as properties where we can enhance returns through value-add renovations and redevelopment. We focus primarily on the following investments:
 

• | single-tenant industrial properties where tenants are paying below-market rents with near-term lease expirations that we believe have a high likelihood of renewal at market rents; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | multi-tenant industrial properties that we believe would benefit from our value-add management approach to create attractive leasing options for our tenants, and as a result of the presence of smaller tenants, obtain higher per-square-foot rents.

 We believe there are a significant number of attractive acquisition opportunities available to us in our target markets and that the fragmented and complex nature of our target markets generally make it difficult for less-experienced or less-focused investors to access comparable opportunities on a consistent basis.
 Our company, was founded in March 2011 by two of our executive officers, Jeffrey Witherell and Pendleton White, Jr., each of whom has at least 25 years of experience acquiring, owning and operating commercial real estate properties. 
 In June 2017, we completed our initial listed public offering of our common stock. The net proceeds of our initial listed public offering were approximately $52.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering costs.  We used approximately $20.0 million of the net proceeds of the offering to redeem Torchlight’s preferred equity interests in one of our subsidiaries and substantially all of the remaining net proceeds to acquire nine additional industrial properties.
 In November 2017, we completed our offering of our 7.50% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. The net proceeds from our Series A Preferred stock offering were approximately $48.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company.
 In July 2018, we completed our follow on offering of our common stock. The net proceeds of our follow on offering of common stock was approximately $17.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs.
 In December 2018, we completed a private placement of our Series B Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock. The net proceeds from our Series B Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock private placement was approximately $71.8 million after deducting underwriting commissions and offering costs.
 Investment Strategy
 Our primary investment strategy is to acquire and own Class B industrial properties predominantly in secondary markets across the U.S. We generally define Class B industrial properties as industrial properties that are typically more than 15 years old, have clear heights between 18 and 26 feet and square footage between 50,000 and 300,000 square feet, with building systems that have adequate capacities to deliver the services currently needed by existing tenants, but may need upgrades for future tenants. In contrast, we define Class A industrial properties as industrial properties that typically are 15 years old or newer, have clear heights in excess of 26 feet and square footage in excess of 300,000 square feet, with energy efficient design characteristics suitable for current and future tenants.

We intend to own and acquire properties that we believe can achieve high initial yields and strong ongoing cash-on-cash returns and that exhibit the potential for increased rental growth in the future. In addition, we may acquire Class A industrial properties that offer similar attractive return characteristics if the cost basis for such properties are comparable to those of Class B industrial properties in a given market or sub-market. While we will focus on investment opportunities in our target markets, we may make opportunistic acquisitions of Class A industrial properties or industrial properties in primary markets when we believe we can achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns.
 We also intend to pursue joint venture arrangements with institutional partners which could provide management fee income as well as residual profit-sharing income. Such joint ventures may involve investing in industrial assets that would be characterized as opportunistic or value-add investments. These may involve development or re-development strategies that may require significant up-front capital expenditures, lengthy lease-up periods and result in inconsistent cash flows. As such, these properties’ risk profiles and return metrics would likely differ from the non-joint venture properties that we target for acquisition.
 We believe we have a competitive advantage in sourcing attractive acquisitions because the competition for our target assets is primarily from local investors who are not likely to have ready access to debt or equity capital. In addition, our umbrella partnership real estate investment trust, or UPREIT, structure enables us to acquire industrial properties on a non-cash basis in a tax efficient manner through the issuance of OP units as full or partial consideration for the transaction. We will also continue to develop our large existing network of relationships with real estate and financial intermediaries. These individuals and companies give us access to significant deal flow—both those broadly marketed and those exposed through only limited marketing. These properties will be acquired primarily from third-party owners of existing leased buildings and secondarily from owner-occupiers through sale-leaseback transactions.
 Growth Strategies
 We seek to maximize our cash flows through proactive asset management. Our asset management team actively manages our properties in an effort to maintain high retention rates, lease vacant space, manage operating expenses and maintain our properties to an appropriate standard. In doing so, we have developed strong tenant relationships. We intend to leverage those relationships and market knowledge to increase renewals, properly prepare tenants for rent increases, obtain early notification of departures to provide longer re-leasing periods and work with tenants to properly maintain the quality and attractiveness of our properties. Our asset management team also collaborates with our internal credit function to actively monitor the credit profile of each of our tenants and prospective tenants on an ongoing basis.
 Our asset management team functions include strategic planning and decision-making, centralized leasing activities and management of third-party leasing companies. Our asset management/credit team oversees property management activities relating to our properties which include controlling capital expenditures and expenses that are not reimbursable by tenants, making regular property inspections, overseeing rent collections and cost control and planning and budgeting activities. Tenant relations matters, including monitoring of tenant compliance with their property maintenance obligations and other lease provisions, will be handled by in-house personnel for most of our properties.
 Financing Strategy
 We intend to maintain a flexible and growth-oriented capital structure. We used the net proceeds from our public offerings along with additional secured and unsecured indebtedness to acquire industrial properties. Our additional indebtedness may include arrangements such as a revolving credit facility or term loan. We believe that we will have the ability to leverage newly-acquired properties with our long-term target debt-to-value ratio of less than 50%. We also anticipate using OP units to acquire properties from existing owners interested in tax-deferred transactions.
Investment Criteria
 We believe that our market knowledge, operations systems and internal processes allow us to efficiently analyze the risks associated with an asset’s ability to produce cash flow going forward. We blend fundamental real estate analysis with corporate credit analysis to make an assessment of probable cash flows that will be realized in future periods. We also use data-driven and event-driven analytics and primary research to identify and pursue emerging investment opportunities.
 Our investment strategy focuses on Class B industrial properties in secondary markets for the following reasons:
 

• | Class B industrial properties generally require less capital expenditures than both Class A industrial properties and other commercial property types; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | investment yields for Class B industrial properties are often greater than investment yields on both Class A industrial properties and other commercial property types; 
• | Class B industrial tenants tend to retain their current space more frequently than Class A industrial tenants; 
• | Class B industrial properties tend to have higher current returns and lower volatility than Class A industrial properties; 
• | we believe there is less competition for Class B industrial properties from institutional real estate buyers; our typical competitors are local investors who often do not have ready access to debt or equity capital; 
• | the Class B industrial real estate market is highly fragmented and complex, which we believe makes it difficult for less-experienced or less-focused investors to access comparable opportunities on a consistent basis;

• | we believe that there is a limited new supply of Class B industrial space in our target markets; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | secondary markets generally have less occupancy and rental rate volatility than primary markets; 
• | Class B industrial properties and secondary markets are typically “cycle agnostic”; i.e. , less prone to overall real estate cycle fluctuations; 
• | we believe secondary markets generally have more growth potential at a lower cost basis than primary markets; and 
• | we believe that the demand for e-commerce-related properties, or e-fulfillment facilities, will continue to grow and play a significant role in our investing strategy.

Regulation
 General
 Our properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas and fire and safety requirements. We believe that we have the necessary permits and approvals to operate each of our properties.
Americans with Disabilities Act
 Our properties must comply with Title III of the ADA to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined under the ADA. Under the ADA, all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. Although we believe that the properties in the Company Portfolio in the aggregate substantially comply with present requirements of the ADA, and we have not received any notice for correction from any regulatory agency, we have not conducted a comprehensive audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine whether we are in compliance and therefore we may own properties that are not in compliance with the ADA.
 ADA compliance is dependent upon the tenant’s specific use of the property, and as the use of a property changes or improvements to existing spaces are made, we will take steps to ensure compliance. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in additional costs to attain compliance, imposition of fines by the U.S. government or an award of damages or attorney’s fees to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and to make alterations to achieve compliance as necessary.
 Environmental Matters
 The Company Portfolio is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws. Under these laws, courts and government agencies have the authority to require us, as owner of a contaminated property, to clean up the property, even if we did not know of or were not responsible for the contamination. These laws also apply to persons who owned a property at the time it became contaminated, and therefore, it is possible we could incur these costs even after we sell some of the properties we acquire. In addition to the costs of cleanup, environmental contamination can affect the value of a property and, therefore, an owner’s ability to borrow using the property as collateral or to sell the property. Under applicable environmental laws, courts and government agencies also have the authority to require that a person who sent waste to a waste disposal facility, such as a landfill or an incinerator, pay for the clean-up of that facility if it becomes contaminated and threatens human health or the environment.
 Furthermore, various court decisions have established that third parties may recover damages for injury caused by property contamination. For instance, a person exposed to asbestos at one of our properties may seek to recover damages if he or she suffers injury from the asbestos. Lastly, some of these environmental laws restrict the use of a property or place conditions on various activities. An example would be laws that require a business using chemicals to manage them carefully and to notify local officials that the chemicals are being used.
 We could be responsible for any of the costs discussed above. The costs to clean up a contaminated property, to defend against a claim, or to comply with environmental laws could be material and could adversely affect the funds available for distribution to our stockholders. We usually require Phase I or similar environmental assessments by independent environmental consultants at the time of acquisition of a property. We generally expect to continue to obtain a Phase I or similar environmental site assessments by independent environmental consultants on each property prior to acquiring it. However, these environmental assessments may not reveal all environmental costs that might have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, results of operations or liquidity and may not identify all potential environmental liabilities.
 We can make no assurances that (1) future laws, ordinances or regulations will not impose material environmental liabilities on us, or (2) the current environmental condition of our properties will not be affected by tenants, the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of our properties (such as releases from underground storage tanks), or by third parties unrelated to us.

Insurance
 We carry commercial property, liability and terrorism coverage on all the properties in the Company Portfolio under a blanket insurance policy. Generally, we do not carry insurance for certain types of extraordinary losses, including, but not limited to, losses caused by riots, war, earthquakes and wildfires unless the property is in a higher risk area for those events. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate and adequate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and standard industry practice, however, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover all of our losses. In addition, our title insurance policies may not insure for the current aggregate market value of the Company Portfolio, and we do not intend to increase our title insurance coverage as the market value of the Company Portfolio increases.
Competition
 In acquiring our properties, we compete with other public industrial property sector REITs, income oriented non-traded REITs, private real estate fund managers and local real estate investors and developers. The last named group, local real estate investors and developers, historically has represented our dominant competition for acquisition opportunities. Many of these entities have greater resources than us or other competitive advantages. We also face significant competition in leasing available properties to prospective tenants and in re-leasing space to existing tenants.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had thirteen full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.
 Legal Proceedings
 We are not currently a party, as plaintiff or defendant, to any material legal proceedings. From time to time, we may become party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. There can be no assurance that these matters that may arise in the future, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
Structure and Formation of Our Company
 Our Company
 We were formed as a Maryland corporation in March 2011 and conduct our business through an UPREIT structure in which our properties are owned by our operating partnership directly or through subsidiaries, as described below under “—Our Operating Partnership.” We are the sole general partner of our operating partnership and indirectly own 82.2% of the OP units in our operating partnership. Our operating partnership owns, directly and indirectly, 100% of the equity interests of its subsidiaries. Our board of directors oversees our business and affairs.
Our Operating Partnership
 Our operating partnership was formed as a Delaware limited partnership in March 2011. Substantially all of our assets are held by, and our operations are conducted through, our operating partnership. Any net proceeds from our public offerings will be contributed to our operating partnership in exchange for OP units. Our interest in our operating partnership will generally entitle us to share in cash distributions from, and in the profits and losses of, our operating partnership in proportion to our percentage ownership. As the sole general partner of our operating partnership, we generally have the exclusive power under the partnership agreement to manage and conduct its business and affairs, subject to certain limited approval and voting rights of the limited partners.
