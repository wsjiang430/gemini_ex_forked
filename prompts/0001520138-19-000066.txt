Item 1. Business
Company Overview 
 
Thenablers, Inc. (“Thenablers, Inc.” or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 3, 2017. The Company is an International Business Development Organization focused in the Design and Execution of New Market Strategies for its clients with the purpose of growing their brand and customer base.
 Although the Company has no market for its common stock, management believes that the Company will meet all requirements to be quoted on the OTC market, and even though the Company’s common stock will likely be a penny stock, becoming a reporting company will provide us with enhanced visibility and give us a greater possibility to provide liquidity to our shareholders.
 We are currently a development stage company and to date we have recorded no revenue. Accordingly, our independent registered public accountants have issued a comment regarding our ability to continue as a going concern (please refer to the footnotes to the financial statements). Until such time that we are able to establish a consistent flow of revenues from our operations which is sufficient to sustain our operating needs, management intends to rely primarily upon debt financing to supplement cash flows, if any, generated by our services. We will seek out such financing as necessary to allow the Company to continue to grow our business operations, and to cover such cost, excluding professional fees, associated with being a reporting Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"); we estimate such costs to be approximately $90,000.00 for 12 months following this Offering. The Company has included such costs to become a publicly reporting company in its targeted expenses for working capital expenses and intends to seek out reasonable loans from friends, family and business acquaintances if it becomes necessary. At this point we have been funded by our founders and initial shareholders and have not received any firm commitments or indications from any family, friends or business acquaintances regarding any potential investment in the Company except those shareholders listed herein.
 Upon obtaining effectiveness, we will conduct the Offering contemplated hereby, and anticipate raising sufficient capital from this offering to market and grow our Company. Assuming we generate nominal revenues, we may still require additional financing to fund our operations past the twelve-month period following the completion of this Offering. While our ability to generate revenue is not correlated directly to the number of shares sold by us under this Offering, our potential to generate revenue can be affected by our marketing and advertising strategies and the amount of personnel the Company employs. These factors are directly related to the amount of proceeds we receive from this Offering, which corresponds to the number of shares we are successful in selling under this offering (see “Use of Proceeds” chart). We believe we can begin generating revenues within the first three months following the successful completion of this Offering. As we are a start-up company, it is unclear how much revenue our operations will generate; however, it is our hopes that our revenues will exceed our costs. Our revenues will be impacted by how successful and well targeted was the execution of our marketing campaign, the general condition of the economy, and the number of clients we will attract. For a further discussion of our initial operations, plan of operations, growth strategy and marketing strategy see the below section entitled “Description of Business”. 
   -1-

 
Neither the Company nor any Director or Officer nor any other affiliated or unaffiliated entity has any plans to use the Company as a vehicle for a private company to become a reporting company once Thenablers, Inc. becomes a reporting company. Additionally, we do not believe the Company is a blank check company as defined in Section a (2) of Rule 419 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended because the Company has a specific business plan and has no plans or intentions to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified entity.

Growth Strategy
 
Thenablers, Inc. growth strategy is geared towards significantly (in the short term) and continuously (in the long term) increasing market share under a methodology that ensures sustainability, by:

1. | Keep increasing the network of collaborating companies
---+-------------------------------------------------------


2. | Enhance infrastructure to manage and get the most out of the network of collaborating companies
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Utilize local know how to develop global solutions

Competition
 
Two main tiers of competition exist in the Outsourcing of International Expansion business:
 

1. | Global Consulting firms
---+------------------------

 Leading companies like Boston Consulting Group, Bain Associates, etc. are linked with large multinational clients under multi-service agreement. As part of their service line they offer “International Expansion / New Market Entry Strategies but they are not considered a threat to Thenablers, Inc. since our targeted client list refers to small/medium enterprises that cannot afford the high pricing schemes such consulting firms offer.
 

2. | Local Consulting Firms
---+-----------------------

 In every market, there are several well perceived, local firms that provide management consulting services at market level. In the case that one of their clients requests assistance in entering new markets, such firms may take the task but hardly execute the “implementation phase” as they do not have the presence or required contacts to global markets. They do pose a threat though as they are well positioned to get the business.
 
 -3-

 

Strengths | ▪ Key shareholders and executives with over 15 years of experience in designing and executing multi-country strategies for their clients ▪ Good geographical coverage that is an asset in the effort of acquisition and execution of contracts ▪ Ability to grow the collaborating network / geography with no major investment ▪ Ability to manage the contracts and collaborating network with low operating cost and low number of human resources 
--------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Weaknesses | ▪ Local collaborating network might not have adequate resources and/or time to execute contracts at proper speed 
Opportunities | ▪ Small / medium enterprises do not have funds to contract large consulting firms to help them expand internationally ▪ Ease of expanding geographical coverage can give quicker access to more small / medium enterprises that are aiming to expand internationally ▪ There is no clearly defined competition for the small / medium enterprises sector other than local consulting companies with no international experience 
Threats | ▪ New contract acquisition might be slow, and the business does not have startup sustainability ▪ Local consulting firms well positioned to get the business but hardly execute the implementation phase

 Clients
 
Our initial revenues in 2019 will be derived from that certain Consulting Services Agreement, dated May 7, 2018, between the Company and Thenablers Ltd., an entity controlled by our CEO Panagiotis Lazaretos, whereby the Company will provide services related to the sales and marketing of “SILBERPFEIL” energy drinks in Cyprus and Greece. As a commission fee for the services, the Company will earn a commission equal to a minimum of one point two cents ($0.012) and a maximum of ten cents ($0.10) per can sold by Thenablers Ltd. in Cyprus and Greece. There was also a one-time fee of $3,000 for setting up the sales and marketing materials.
 
The above-mentioned contract (SILBERFEIL Greece/Cyprus) will be examined with the goal of being moved to Thenablers, Inc. from Thenablers Ltd so the consulting agreement from May 7, 2018 will cease to exist, and revenues shall derive from the sales of the “SILBERPFEIL” energy drinks. In addition, any similar agreements regarding SILBERPFEIL shall be transferred to THENABLERS Inc from THENABLERS, Ltd. Any decision regarding the transfer of the May 7, 2018 agreement will be made during the second quarter of 2019.

The Greece and Cyprus agreements are Exclusive Distribution contracts. The distribution contracts have a five-year term for providing sales and services, targeting a ten percent (10%) penetration into the respective territory’s energy drink market. If we meet our distribution targets, our revenues should be approximately $1,300,000 to $1,500,000 in year 5 (2022) in each of the contracts with 5% gross profitability. For more details regarding the terms of these agreements, please refer to our exhibits.
 
Under a previous agency agreement in Mexico, we had a nine-month period to identify Mexican distributors. If successful, the Company would have received a fee at closing and a percentage-based commission on the sales volume between the identified distributor and the SILBERFEIL, for as long as the relationship is in existence. This agreement is not any more in existence.
 
We currently have a contract with GBR GERMAN UG Constructions GmbH for the sales of pre-fabricated homes made from shipping containers, with exclusive rights for distribution in Zambia and India. We currently have no sales from this agreement.
 
We will continue to rely upon our contracts with SILBERPFEIL and GBR German UG Constructions GmbH for the remainder of 2019.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We don’t have current intellectual property.
 
Employees
 
Thenablers, Inc. currently has no employees. Our officer and director are donating their time to the development of the company and intend to do whatever work is necessary in order to bring the Company to the point of earning revenues.
